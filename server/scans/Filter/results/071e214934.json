The alternative may lead to devaluation of individual rights and social values, rejection of AI-based innovation, and ultimately a missed opportunity to use AI to improve individual wellbeing and social welfare. Humanity learned this lesson the hard way when it did not regulate the impact of the industrial revolution on labor forces, and also when it recognized too late the environmental impact of massive industrialization and global consumerism.
