At the\nsame time, as AI becomes invisibly ubiquitous, new ethical challenges emerge. The protection of human self-determination is one\nof the most relevant and must be addressed\nurgently. The application of AI to profile users for targeted advertising, as in the case of\nonline service providers, and in political campaigns, as unveiled by the Cambridge Analytica case, offer clear examples of the potential\nof AI to capture users’ preferences and characteristics and hence shape their goals and\nnudge their behavior to an extent that may\nundermine their self-determination.\n\nis an excellent example. The goal of this program is to define new techniques to explain\nthe decision-making processes of AI systems.\nThis will enable users to understand how AI\nsystems work, and designers and developers\nto improve the systems to avoid mistakes and\nmitigate the risks of misuse. To be successful, similar projects must include an ethical\nimpact analysis from the beginning, to assess\nAI’s benefits and risks and define guiding\nprinciples for an ethically sound design and\nuse of AI.\nThe effects of decisions or actions based\non AI are often the result of countless interactions among many actors, including\ndesigners, developers, users, software, and\nhardware. This is known as distributed\nagency (10). With distributed agency comes\ndistributed responsibility. Existing ethical frameworks address individual, human\nresponsibility, with the goal of allocating\npunishment or reward based on the actions and intentions of an individual. They\nwere not developed to deal with distributed\nresponsibility.\nOnly recently have new ethical theories\nbeen defined to take distributed agency into\naccount. The proposed theories rely on contractual and tort liability (11) or on strict liability (12) and adopt a faultless responsibility\nmodel. This model separates responsibility\nof an agent from their intentions to perform\na given action or their ability to control its\noutcomes, and holds all agents of a distributed system, such as a company, responsible.\nThis is key when considering the case of AI,\nbecause it distributes moral responsibility\namong designers, regulators, and users. In\ndoing so, the model plays a central role in\npreventing evil and fostering good, because\nit nudges all involved agents to adopt responsible behaviors.\nEstablishing good practices for delegation\nand defining new models to ascribe moral responsibility are essential to seize the opportunities created by AI and address the related\nchallenges, but they are still not enough.\nEthical analyses must be extended to account\nfor the invisible influence exercised by AI on\nhuman behavior.\n\nINSIGHTS | P E R S P E C T I V E S\n\n752\n\nsciencemag.org SCIENCE\n\n24 AUGUST 2018 • VOL 361 ISSUE 6404\n\nPublished by AAAS\n\nPHOTO: BSIP/UIG VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nDownloaded from http://science.sciencemag.org/ on August 24, 2018\n\nments and becomes an invisible facilitator\nregulations, and uses of this technology.\nseized for lack of clarity or fear of backlash.\nthat mediates our interactions in a conveOnce identified, ethical principles must\nEthical regulation of the design and use of\nnient, barely noticeable way.
