The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered. The geography, climate and wildlife of the country are extremely diverse.[21]\n At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2)[19] and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world’sfourth-largest country by total area (and fourth-largest by land area)[fn 2] and the third-most populous. It is one of the world’s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world’s largest immigrant population.[26] Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions. The country’s capital isWashington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City; the other major metropolitan areas, all with around five million or more inhabitants, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, andAtlanta.\n Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago.[27] European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years’ War led to theAmerican Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in theAmerican Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire.[28] The current constitutionwas adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.\n The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century,[29]displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848.[29] During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legalslavery in the country.[30][31] By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean,[32] and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.[33] The Spanish–American War andWorld War I confirmed the country’s status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War IIas a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and apermanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organizations. The end of the Cold War and thedissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world’s sole superpower.[34]\n The United States is a highly developed country, with the world’s largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage,[35] human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person.[36] While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world.[37] Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total,[38] the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP[39] and almost a third of global military spending,[40] making it the world’s foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.[41]\n   Contents  [hide] \n \n  1Etymology\n  2History  2.1Indigenous and European contact\n 2.2Settlements\n 2.3Independence and expansion (1776–1865)\n 2.4Civil War and Reconstruction Era\n 2.5Industrialization\n 2.6World War I, Great Depression, and World War II\n 2.7Cold War and civil rights era\n 2.8Contemporary history\n  \n  3Geography, climate, and environment  3.1Wildlife\n  \n  4Demographics  4.1Population\n 4.2Language\n 4.3Religion\n 4.4Family structure\n  \n  5Government and politics  5.1Political divisions\n 5.2Parties and elections\n 5.3Foreign relations\n 5.4Government finance\n 5.5Military\n  \n 6Law enforcement and crime\n  7Economy  7.1Income, poverty and wealth\n  \n  8Infrastructure  8.1Transportation\n 8.2Energy\n 8.3Water supply and sanitation\n  \n 9Education\n  10Culture  10.1Food\n 10.2Literature, philosophy, and the arts\n 10.3Music\n 10.4Cinema\n 10.5Sports\n 10.6Media\n  \n 11Science and technology\n 12Health\n 13See also\n 14Notes\n 15References\n  16Bibliography and further reading  16.1Website sources\n  \n 17External links\n  \n Etymology See also: Naming of America, Names for United States citizens, American (word), and Names of the United States \n In 1507 the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere “America” after the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin: Americus Vespucius).[42] The first documentary evidence of the phrase “United States of America” is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., George Washington‘s aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army. Addressed to Lt. Col. Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed his wish to carry the “full and ample powers of the United States of America” to Spain to assist in the revolutionary war effort.[43][44][45]\n The first known publication of the phrase “United States of America” was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[46][47] The second draft of the Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared “The name of this Confederation shall be the ‘United States of America.'”[48] The final version of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence “The Stile of this Confederacy shall be ‘The United States of America'”.[49] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA” in all capitalized letters in the headline of his “original Rough draught” of the Declaration of Independence.[50][51] This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.[48] In the final Fourth of July version of the Declaration, the title was changed to read, “The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America”.[52] The preamble of the Constitution states “…establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”\n The short form “United States” is also standard. Other common forms are the “U.S.”, the “USA”, and “America”. Colloquial names are the “U.S. of A.” and, internationally, the “States”. “Columbia“, a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the name “District of Columbia“.[53] In non-English languages, the name is frequently the translation of either the “United States” or “United States of America”, and colloquially as “America”. In addition, an abbreviation (e.g. USA) is sometimes used.[54]\n The phrase “United States” was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., “the United States are”—including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865. The singular form—e.g., “the United States is”— became popular after the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom “these United States”.[55] The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.[56]\n A citizen of the United States is an “American“. “United States”, “American” and “U.S.” refer to the country adjectivally (“American values”, “U.S. forces”). “American” rarely refers to subjects not connected with the United States.[57]\n History Main articles: History of the United States, Timeline of United States history, American business history, Economic history of the United States, and Labor history of the United States \n Indigenous and European contact Further information: Pre-Columbian era and Colonial history of the United States \n     \n An artistic recreation of The Kincaid Site from the prehistoric Mississippian culture as it may have looked at its peak 1050-1400 AD\n \n \n \n     \n Italian explorer Christoper Columbus arrives in America and takes possession of Guanahani\n \n \n \n The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[27] Some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies.[58] After the Spanish conquistadorsmade the first contacts, the native population declined for various reasons, primarily from diseases such as smallpox andmeasles. Violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline among Native Americans, though conflict among themselves and with Europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial settlements.[59][60][61][62][63][64] In the Hawaiian Islands, the earliest indigenous inhabitants arrived around 1 AD from Polynesia. Europeans under the British explorerCaptain James Cook arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778.\n In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.[65] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to “civilize” the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.[66][67]\n Settlements Further information: European colonization of the Americas and Thirteen Colonies \n     \n Globe showing North America from 1602.\n \n \n \n     \n Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine, Florida, the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the United States\n \n \n \n     \n The signing of the Mayflower Compact, 1620\n \n \n \n After Spain sent Columbus on his first voyage to the New World in 1492, other explorers followed. The Spanish set up small settlements in New Mexico and Florida. France had several small settlements along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims’Plymouth Colony in 1620. Early experiments in communal living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings.[68] Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent’s first elected legislative assembly, Virginia’s House of Burgesses created in 1619, and the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[69][70]\n Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world’s iron supply.[71] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servantspushed further west.[72]\n Slave cultivation of cash crops began with the Spanish in the 1500s, and was adopted by the English, but life expectancy was much higher in North America because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves.[73][74][75] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.[76][77] But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.[78]\n With the British colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America were established.[79] All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism.[80] With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.[81] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.[82]\n During the Seven Years’ War (also known as the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, those 13 colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[83] The colonies’ distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.[84]\n Independence and expansion (1776–1865) Further information: American Revolutionary War, United States Declaration of Independence, American Revolution, andTerritorial evolution of the United States \n     \n The Declaration of Independence: the Committee of Five presenting their draft to the Second Continental Congress in 1776\n \n \n \n The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of “republicanism” asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen and “no taxation without representation”. The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.[85]\n Following the passage of the Lee Resolution, on July 2, 1776, which was the actual vote for independence, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, which proclaimed, in a long preamble, that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great Britain, and declared, in the words of the resolution, that the Thirteen Colonies were independent states and had no allegiance to the British crown in the United States. The fourth day of July is celebrated annually as Independence Day. In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789.[86]\n Britain recognized the independence of the United States following their defeat at Yorktown.[87] In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[88]\n Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population.[89][90][91] The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800-1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[92] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[93]\n Americans’ eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars.[94] The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation’s area.[95] The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism.[96] A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[97] Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America’s large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&amp;M; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation’s land.[98]\n     \n U.S. territorial acquisitions–portions of each territory were granted statehood since the 18th century.\n \n \n \n From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider white male suffrage; it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed theRepublic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny.[99] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[100] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[101]\n The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration and the creation of additional western states.[102] After theAmerican Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[103] Over a half-century, the loss of the American bison (sometimes called “buffalo”) was an existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures.[104] In 1869, a new Peace Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship, although conflicts, including several of the largest Indian Wars, continued throughout the West into the 1900s.[105]\n Civil War and Reconstruction Era Further information: American Civil War and Reconstruction Era \n     \n The Battle of Gettysburg,Pennsylvania during the Civil War byThure de Thulstrup\n \n \n \n Differences of opinion and social order between northern and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding Black slavery, ultimately led to the American Civil War.[106] Initially, states entering the Union alternated betweenslave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.[107]\n With the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America, while the federal government maintained that secession was illegal.[107] The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863 as casualties mounted and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, a second war aim became abolition of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.[108]\n Following the Union victory in 1865, three amendments were added to the U.S. Constitution: the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited slavery, the Fourteenth Amendment provided citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,[109] and the Fifteenth Amendment ensured that they had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power[110] aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves.\n Southern white conservatives, calling themselves “Redeemers” took control after the end of Reconstruction. By the 1890-1910 period Jim Crow laws disenfranchisedmost blacks and some poor whites. Especially in the South and the West blacks, Indians, Chinese and Hispanics faced systemic discrimination, including racial segregation[not in citation given] and occasional vigilante violence.[111][112]\n Industrialization Main articles: Economic history of the United States and Technological and industrial history of the United States \n     \n Ellis Island in New York City was a major gateway for Europeanimmigration.\n \n \n \n In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country’s industrialization and transformed its culture.[113] National infrastructure including telegraph andtranscontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.[114]\n The end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets.[115] Mainland expansion was completed by the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[116] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico,Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War.[117]\n Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists.Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation’s progess in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with J.P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Teslaundertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lightiing. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The American economy boomed, becoming the world’s largest, and the United States achieved great power status.[118] These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[119] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women’s suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.\n World War I, Great Depression, and World War II Further information: World War I, Great Depression, and World War II \n     \n U.S. troops approaching Omaha Beach in 1944\n \n \n \n The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I, in 1914, until 1917 when it joined the war as an “associated power”, alongside the formal Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this, and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[120]\n In 1920, the women’s rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women’s suffrage.[121] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television.[122] The prosperity of theRoaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system.[123] The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s;[124] whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[125]\n At first effectively neutral during World War II while Germany conquered much of continental Europe, the United States began supplying material to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers.[126] During the war, the United States was referred as one of the “Four Policemen“[127] of Allies power who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union and China.[128][129] Though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,[130] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[131]\n The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences with the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and other Allies, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe’s postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conferenceheld in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[132] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan; the Japanese surrendered on September 2, ending World War II.[133]\n Cold War and civil rights era Main articles: History of the United States (1945–64), History of the United States (1964–80), and History of the United States (1980–91) \n     \n U.S. President Ronald Reagan at his “Tear down this wall!” speech inBerlin, Germany on June 12, 1987. TheIron Curtain of Europe manifested the division of the world’s superpowers during the Cold War.\n \n \n \n After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what became known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism[134] and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.\n The U.S. often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored. American troops fought communistChinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–53.[135] The Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a “Space Race” in which the United States became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969.[135] A proxy war in Southeast Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War.\n At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation’s infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[136][137] In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state added to the country.[138]The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination.[139][140][141] Meanwhile, acounterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution. The launch of a “War on Poverty” expanded entitlements and welfare spending.[142]\n The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned “containment” and initiated the more aggressive “rollback” strategy towards the USSR.[143][144][145][146][147] After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[148]\n The late 1980s brought a “thaw” in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.[149][150][151][152] This brought about unipolarity[153]with the U.S. unchallenged as the world’s dominant superpower. The concept of Pax Americana, which had appeared in the post-World War II period, gained wide popularity as a term for the post-Cold War new world order.\n Contemporary history Main article: History of the United States (1991–present) \n    \n The former World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan during September 11 attacks in 2001\n \n  \n  One World Trade Center, built in its place\n \n \n \n \n After the Cold War, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.[154] Originating in U.S. defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic networks, and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the global economy, society, and culture.[155] On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[156] In response, the United States launched the War on Terror, which included war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.[157][158]\n Beginning in 1994, the U.S. entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade among the three partners has soared since NAFTA went into force.[159]\n Barack Obama, the first African American[160] and multiracial[161] president, was elected in 2008 amid the Great Recession,[162] which began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009.[163]\n Geography, climate, and environment Main articles: Geography of the United States, Climate of the United States, and Environment of the United States \n     \n A composite satellite image of the contiguous United States and surrounding areas\n \n \n \n     \n Köppen climate types of the US\n \n \n \n The land area of the contiguous United States is 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940.6 km2). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856.2 km2). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. The populated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2).[164]\n The United States is the world’s third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted and how the total size of the United States is measured: calculations range from 3,676,486 square miles (9,522,055.0 km2)[165] to 3,717,813 square miles (9,629,091.5 km2)[166] to 3,796,742 square miles (9,833,516.6 km2)[6] to 3,805,927 square miles (9.9 Mm2).[19] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.[167]\n The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of thePiedmont.[168] The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of theMidwest.[169] The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world’s fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[169]\n The Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[170] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as theChihuahua and Mojave.[171] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[172] and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[173] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska’sDenali (Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and North America.[174] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska’s Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent’s largest volcanic feature.[175]\n The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[176] The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have analpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washingtonand southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[177] Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world’s tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[178]\n     \n Sun setting over the Mojave desert,California\n \n \n \n Wildlife Main articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States \n See also: Category:Biota of the United States \n     \n The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782.[179]\n \n \n \n The U.S. ecology is megadiverse: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[180] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species.[181] About 91,000 insect species have been described.[182] The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself.[183]\n There are 58 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[184] Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country’s land area.[185] Most of this is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; about .86% is used for military purposes.[186][187]\n Environmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation,[188][189] and international responses to global warming.[190][191] Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is theEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[192] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[193] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.[194]\n Demographics Main articles: Demography of the United States, Americans, List of U.S. states by population density, and List of United States cities by population \n Population    Race/Ethnicity (2015 ACS estimates)[195]     By race:[195]    White 73.1%   Black 12.7%   Asian 5.4%   Some other race 4.8%   Multiracial 3.1%    American Indian and Alaska Native  0.8%    Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander  0.2%    By ethnicity:[195]     Hispanic/Latino (of any race) 17.6%   Non-Hispanic/Latino (of any race) 82.4%        \n Largest ancestry groups by county (2000), led byGerman Americans\n \n \n \n The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the country’s population to be 323,425,550 as of April 25, 2016, and to be adding 1 person (net gain) every 13 seconds, or about 6,646 people per day.[196] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from about 76 million in 1900.[197] The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected.[198] In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children, by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56.[199] Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.86 children per woman in 2014. Foreign born immigration has caused the US population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 40 million in 2010, representing one third of the population increase.[200] The foreign born population reached 45 million in 2015.[201][fn 3]\n The United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world average.[205] Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher than that of many developed nations.[206] In fiscal year 2012, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.[207] Mexicohas been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the Philippineshave been in the top four sending countries every year since the 1990s.[208] As of 2012, approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal immigrants.[209] As of 2015, 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing.[201]\n According to a survey conducted by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.[210][211] A 2012 Gallup poll also concluded that 3.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%.[212] In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.[213]\n In 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Nativeancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or Pacific islandancestry (0.5 million exclusively).[214] The census counted more than 19 million people of “Some Other Race” who were “unable to identify with any” of its five official race categories in 2010, over 18.5 million (97%) of whom are of Hispanic ethnicity.[214]\n The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend. The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent[214] are identified as sharing a distinct “ethnicity” by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent.[215] Between 2000 and 2010, the country’s Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%.[216] Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[217][fn 4]\n     \n U.S. population density in 2005\n \n \n \n About 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs);[6] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[223] The US has numerous clusters of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalitieshad populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston).[224] There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million.[225] Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South.[226] The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008.[225]\n     Leading population centers (see complete list)    view\n talk\n edit\n  \n    Rank Core city (cities) Metro area population Metropolitan Statistical Area Region[227]   \n New York City \n Los Angeles\n \n Chicago\n \n Dallas\n    1 New York 20,182,305 New York–Newark–Jersey City, NY–NJ–PA MSA Mid-Atlantic   2 Los Angeles 13,340,068 Los Angeles–Long Beach–Santa Ana, CA MSA West   3 Chicago 9,551,031 Chicago–Joliet–Naperville, IL–IN–WI MSA Midwest   4 Dallas–Fort Worth 7,102,796 Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington, TX MSA West   5 Houston 6,656,947 Houston–The Woodlands-Sugar Land MSA West   6 Washington, D.C. 6,097,684 Washington, DC–VA–MD–WV MSA Mid-Atlantic   7 Philadelphia 6,069,875 Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington, PA–NJ–DE–MD MSA Mid-Atlantic   8 Miami 6,012,331 Miami–Fort Lauderdale–Pompano Beach, FL MSA South   9 Atlanta 5,710,795 Atlanta–Sandy Springs–Roswell, GA MSA South   10 Boston 4,774,321 Boston–Cambridge–Quincy, MA–NH MSA New England   11 San Francisco 4,656,132 San Francisco–Oakland–Fremont, CA MSA West   12 Phoenix 4,574,531 Phoenix–Mesa–Glendale, AZ MSA West   13 Riverside–San Bernardino 4,489,159 Riverside–San Bernardino–Ontario, CA MSA West   14 Detroit 4,302,043 Detroit–Warren–Livonia, MI MSA Midwest   15 Seattle 3,733,580 Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue, WA MSA West   16 Minneapolis–St. Paul 3,524,583 Minneapolis–St. Paul–Bloomington, MN–WI MSA Midwest   17 San Diego 3,299,521 San Diego–Carlsbad–San Marcos, CA MSA West   18 Tampa–St. Petersburg 2,975,225 Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater, FL MSA South   19 Denver 2,814,330 Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO MSA West   20 St. Louis 2,811,588 St. Louis MO–IL MSA Midwest   Based on 2015 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[228]     \n \n Language Main article: Languages of the United States \n See also: Language Spoken at Home in the United States of America, List of endangered languages in the United States, and Language education in the United States \n  Languages spoken at home by more than 1 million persons in the U.S. (2010)[229][fn 5]    Language Percent of\n population Number of\n speakers Number who\n speak English\n well or very well      English (only)  80% 233,780,338 All   Combined total of all languages\n other than English 20% 57,048,617 43,659,301    Spanish\n (excluding Puerto Rico and Spanish Creole)  12% 35,437,985 25,561,139    Chinese\n (including Cantonese and Mandarin)  0.9% 2,567,779 1,836,263   Tagalog 0.5% 1,542,118 1,436,767   Vietnamese 0.4% 1,292,448 879,157    French\n (including Cajun but not Haitian Creole)  0.4% 1,288,833 1,200,497   Korean 0.4% 1,108,408 800,500   German 0.4% 1,107,869 1,057,836     English (American English) is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.[230][231] Some Americans advocate making English the country’s official language, as it is in 32 states.[232]\n Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state law.[233]Alaska recognizes twenty Native languages.[234] While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[235] Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms.[236] Many jurisdictions with large numbers of non-English speakers produce government materials, especially voting information, in the most commonly spoken languages in those jurisdictions.\n Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan[237] and Chamorro[238] are recognized byAmerican Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands;[239] Cherokee is officially recognized by theCherokee Nation within the Cherokee tribal jurisdiction area in eastern Oklahoma;[240] Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there.[241]\n According to the Center for Immigration Studies, Arabic and Urdu are the fastest-growing foreign languages spoken in American households. In recent years, Arabic-speaking residents increased by 29%, Urdu by 23% and Persian by 9%.[242]\n The most widely taught foreign languages at all levels in the United States (in terms of enrollment numbers) are: Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners) include Latin, Japanese, American Sign Language, Italian, and Chinese.[243][244] 18% of all Americans claim to speak at least one language in addition to English.[245]\n \n Religion Main article: Religion in the United States \n See also: History of religion in the United States, Freedom of religion in the United States, Separation of church and state in the United States, and List of religious movements that began in the United States \n  Religious affiliation in the U.S. (2014)[5]    Affiliation  % of U.S. population     Christian 70.6  \n    Protestant 46.5  \n    Evangelical Protestant 25.4  \n    Mainline Protestant 14.7  \n    Black church 6.5  \n    Catholic 20.8  \n    Mormon 1.6  \n    Jehovah’s Witnesses 0.8  \n    Eastern Orthodox 0.5  \n    Other Christian 0.4  \n    Jewish 1.9  \n    Muslim 0.9  \n    Buddhist 0.7  \n    Hindu 0.7  \n    Other faiths 1.8  \n    Irreligious 22.8  \n    Nothing in particular 15.8  \n    Agnostic 4.0  \n    Atheist 3.1  \n    Don’t know or refused answer 0.6  \n    Total 100  \n      The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment. Christianity is by far the most common religion practiced in the U.S., but other religions are followed, too. In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a “very important role in their lives”, a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.[246] In a 2009 Gallup poll, 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.[247]\n As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30.[248] Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion has been declining since the mid to late 1980s,[249] and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious.[5][250] According to a 2012 study, Protestant share of U.S. population dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time.[251][252][253] Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.[254]\n According to a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults identified themselves as Christian,[255] Protestantdenominations accounted for 46.5%, while Roman Catholicism, at 20.8%, was the largest individual denomination.[256] The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2014 was 5.9%.[256]Other religions include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%), Buddhism (0.7%), Hinduism (0.7%).[256]The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in 1990.[256][257][258] There are also Unitarian Universalist, Baha’i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan,humanist and deist communities.[259]\n Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism, and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination. About 26% of Americans identify as Evangelical Protestants, while 15% are Mainline and 7% belong to a traditionally Black church. Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin in the Spanish and Frenchcolonization of the Americas, and later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island has the highest percentage of Catholics with 40 percent of the total population.[260] Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe and Germany. North and South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Presbyterianism was introduced in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants. Although it has spread across the United States, it is heavily concentrated on the East Coast. Dutch Reformed congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam (New York City) before spreading westward. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.[261]\n The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation’s average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.[247]\n Family structure Main article: Family structure in the United States \n As of 2007, 58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 25% had never been married.[262] Women now work mostly outside the home and receive a majority of bachelor’s degrees.[263]\n The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991.[264] In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, and the lowest in Wyoming.[264][265] Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[266] In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.[267]\n The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births per woman.[268] Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).[269] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[270] Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide and it is legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[271]\n Government and politics Main articles: Federal government of the United States, State governments of the United States, Local government in the United States, and Elections in the United States \n    \n  The United States Capitol,\n where Congress meets:\n the Senate, left; the House, right\n \n \n  \n  The White House, home of the U.S. President \n \n \n  \n   Supreme Court Building, where the nation’s highest court sits\n \n \n \n \n \n The United States is the world’s oldest surviving federation. It is aconstitutional republic and representative democracy, “in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law“.[272] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country’s supreme legal document.[273] For 2014, the U.S. ranked 19th on the Democracy Index[274] and 17th on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[275]\n In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government‘s duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is rare at lower levels.[276]\n The federal government is composed of three branches:\n   Legislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has thepower of the purse,[277] and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[278] \n  Executive: The President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to Congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.[279] \n  Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the President with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[280] \n      \n The Statue of Liberty in New York City is a symbol of both the U.S. and the ideals of freedom, democracy, and opportunity.[281]\n \n \n \n The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census, seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, had 53.[282]\n The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[283] The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[284] However, the court currently has one vacant seat after the death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia.[285]\n The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature.[286] Thegovernor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote.\n The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article Oneprotects the right to the “great writ” of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[287] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans’ individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[288] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[289]\n Political divisions Main articles: Political divisions of the United States, U.S. state, Territories of the United States, List of states and territories of the United States, and Indian reservation \n Further information: Territorial evolution of the United States and United States territorial acquisitions \n     \n Map of U.S. Economic Exclusion Zone,[290] highlighting states, territories and possessions\n \n \n \n The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and eleven uninhabited island possessions.[291] The states and territories are the principal administrative districts in the country. These are divided into subdivisions of counties and independent cities. The District of Columbia is a federal district which contains the capital of the United States, Washington DC.[292] The states and the District of Columbia choose the President of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their Representatives and Senators in Congress; the District of Columbia has three.[293]\n Congressional Districts are reapportioned among the states following each decennial Census of Population. Each state then draws single member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The total number of Representatives is 435, and delegate Members of Congress represent the District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories.[294]\n The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states’ sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they have a great deal of autonomy, but also like the states tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.[295]\n      State flags and statehood dates\n        \n     [show] (listed alphabetically)\n            \n     [show] (listed chronologically)\n             Statehood date is the date of ratifying the Constitution (for the first 13) or being admitted to the Union (for subsequent states) \n     \n Parties and elections Main articles: Politics of the United States and Political ideologies in the United States \n     \n President Obama meets with congressional leadership in 2011.[296]\n \n \n \n The United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its history.[297] For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as aProgressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.[298]\n Within American political culture, the center-right Republican Party is considered “conservative” and the center-leftDemocratic Party is considered “liberal“.[299][300] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as “blue states“, are relatively liberal. The “red states” of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative.\n The winner of the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, Democrat Barack Obama, is the 44th, and current, U.S. president. On November 8, 2016, Donald Trump, representing the Republican Party, was elected the 45th president.[301] Current leadership in the Senate includes Democratic Vice President Joseph Biden, Republican President Pro Tempore (Pro Tem) Orrin Hatch, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Harry Reid.[302] Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[303]\n In the 114th United States Congress, both the House of Representatives and the Senate are controlled by the Republican Party. The Senate currently consists of 54 Republicans, and 44 Democrats with 2 Independents who caucus with the Democrats; the House consists of 247 Republicans and 186 Democrats, with 2 vacancies.[304] In state governorships, there are 31 Republicans, 18 Democrats and 1 Independent.[305] Among the DC mayor and the 5 territorial governors, there are 2 Republicans, 1 Democrat, 1 Popular Democrat), and 2 Independents.[306]\n Foreign relations Main articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States \n     \n The United Nations Headquarters was built inMidtown Manhattan in 1952.[307]\n \n \n \n The United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters. It is a member of the G7,[308] G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military equipment).[309]\n The United States has a “Special Relationship” with the United Kingdom[310] and strong ties with Canada,[311] Australia,[312] New Zealand,[313] the Philippines,[314] Japan,[315] South Korea,[316] Israel,[317] and several European Union countries, including France,Italy, Germany, and Spain. It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance, the most in the world. As a share of America’s large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast, private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.[318]\n The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau. These are Pacific island nations, once part of the U.S.-administeredTrust Territory of the Pacific Islands after World War II, which gained independence in subsequent years.[319]\n Government finance See also: Taxation in the United States and United States federal budget \n     \n US federal debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, from 1790 to 2013.[320]\n \n \n \n Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state and local government level. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[321] During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%).[322]Based on CBO estimates,[323] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.[324]\n U.S. taxation is generally progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and is among the most progressive in the developed world.[325][326][327][328][329] The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes,[330] and about half of all taxes.[331] Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[332][333] The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[334][335] However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.[336]\n The top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes.[337] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile.[338][339] The incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades.[328][340] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.[328][341]\n During FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare &amp; Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).[322]\n The total national debt of the United States in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP) in 2014.[342][fn 6]\n Military Main article: United States Armed Forces \n     \n The carrier strike groups of the Kitty Hawk, Ronald Reagan, and Abraham Lincoln with aircraft from the Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force.\n \n \n \n The President holds the title of commander-in-chief of the nation’s armed forces and appoints its leaders, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including theArmy, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. TheReserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[347]\n Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.[348] American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force’s large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy’s 10 active aircraft carriers, andMarine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy’s Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad,[349] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[350]\n The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[351]U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA.[352] Defense’s share of U.S. spending has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.[353]\n     \n US global military presence.\n \n \n \n The proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.[354] The last American troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011;[355] 4,484 service members were killed during the Iraq War.[356] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012;[357] by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan.[358]\n Law enforcement and crime Main articles: Law enforcement in the United States and Crime in the United States \n See also: Law of the United States, Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, Human rights in the United States § Justice system, Incarceration in the United States, and Capital punishment in the United States \n     \n Law enforcement in the U.S. is maintained primarily by local police departments.[359]\n \n \n \n Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police and sheriff‘s departments, with state policeproviding broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protectingcivil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts‘ rulings and federal laws.[360] At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.[361]\n In 2015, there were 15,696 murders which was 1,532 more than in 2014, a 10.8 per cent increase, the largest since 1971.[362] The murder rate in 2015 was 4.9 per 100,000 people.[363] In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980.[364] In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other developed nations.[365] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2003 showed that United States “homicide rates were 6.9 times higher than rates in the other high-income countries, driven by firearm homicide rates that were 19.5 times higher.”[366][needs update] Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject of contentious political debate.\n From 1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of homicide victims and 90% of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites (“whites” includes most Hispanics), and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims killed by whites.[367] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.[368] The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes.[369]\n Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and used in 31 states.[370][371] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.[372] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2014, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.[373]\n The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and total prison population in the world.[374] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults.[375] At year end 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision at yearend 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997.[376] The prison population has quadrupled since 1980,[377] and state and local spending on prisons and jails has grown three times as much as that spent on public education during the same period.[378] However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013[379] and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012.[380] The country’s high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes insentencing guidelines and drug policies.[381] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[382] The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been a subject of debate.[383][384] In 2008, Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate,[385] and Maine the lowest.[386]\n Economy Main article: Economy of the United States \n See also: Economic history of the United States \n    Economic indicators   Nominal GDP  $18.45 trillion (Q2 2016)  [387]   Real GDP growth 1.4% (Q2 2016)[387]     2.6% (2015)  [388]    CPI inflation 1.1% (August 2016)  [389]   Employment-to-population ratio 59.7% (August 2016)  [390]   Unemployment 4.9% (August 2016)  [391]    Labor force participation rate 62.8% (August 2016)  [392]   Total public debt $19.808 trillion (October 25, 2016)  [393]   Household net worth $89.063 trillion (Q2 2016)  [394]        \n United States export treemap (2011): The U.S. is the world’s second-largest exporter.\n \n \n \n The United States has a capitalist mixed economy[395] which is fueled by abundant natural resources and high productivity.[396] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[397]\n The US’s nominal GDP is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014[398] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[399]The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP.[397] TheU.S. dollar is the world’s primary reserve currency.[400]\n The United States is the largest importer of goods and second-largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.[401] Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, andGermany are its top trading partners.[402] In 2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the country’s largest export.[401] Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt.[403] The largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve, who hold the majority of the debt.[404][405][406][407][fn 7]\n In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%.[410] The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1.[411] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power.[412] The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing.[413] In the franchisingbusiness model, McDonald’s and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the world.[414]\n Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field.[415] The United States is the largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its second-largest importer.[416] It is the world’s number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The National Mining Associationprovides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium, copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, titaniumand others.[417][418]\n Agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP,[412] yet the United States is the world’s top producer of corn[419] and soybeans.[420] The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice,cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef,poultry, pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food, representing half of the world’s biotech crops.[421]\n Consumer spending comprises 68% of the U.S. economy in 2015.[422] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe.[423] The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers.[424]The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to.[425]\n The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation[426] and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia.[427] However, 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits.[428] While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it’s a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations.[428] In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.[429]\n The 2008–2012 global recession significantly affected the United States, with output still below potential according to the Congressional Budget Office.[430] It brought high unemployment (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising petroleum and food prices. There remains a record proportion of long-term unemployed, continued decreasing household income, and tax and federal budget increases.[431][432][433]\n Income, poverty and wealth     \n A tract housing development in San Jose, California.\n \n \n \n Further information: Income in the United States, Poverty in the United States, Affluence in the United States, United States counties by per capita income, and Income inequality in the United States \n Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD nations, and in 2007 had the second-highest median household income.[434][435] According to the Census Bureau, median household income was $53,657 in 2014.[436] Despite accounting for only 4.4% of the global population, Americans collectively possess 41.6% of the world’s total wealth,[437] and Americans make up roughly half of the world’s population of millionaires.[438] The Global Food Security Indexranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[439] Americans on average have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and more than every EU nation.[440] For 2013 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 5th among 187 countries in itsHuman Development Index and 28th in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[441]\n There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[442] However, the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance.[443] While inflation-adjusted (“real”) household income had been increasing almost every year from 1947 to 1999, it has since been flat on balance and has even decreased recently.[444] According to Congressional Research Service, during this same period, immigration to the United States increased, while the lower 90% of tax filers incomes became stagnant, and eventually decreasing since 2000.[445] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affectedincome inequality,[446] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[447] The post-recession income gains have been very uneven, with the top 1 percent capturing 95 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2012.[448] The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.[449][disputed – discuss][450]\n  United States’ families median net worth source: Fed Survey of Consumer Finances[451]    in 2013 dollars 1998 2013 change   All families $102,500 $81,200 -20.8%   Bottom 20% of incomes $8,300 $6,100 -26.5%   2nd lowest 20% of incomes $47,400 $22,400 -52.7%   Middle 20% of incomes $76,300 $61,700 -19.1%   Top 10% $646,600 $1,130,700 +74.9%    Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country’s household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.[452] Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[453] Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down $14 trillion, but has since increased $14 trillion over 2006 levels.[454][455] At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to $11.8 trillion,[456] down from $13.8 trillion at the end of 2008.[457]\n There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[458] In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic.[459] According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty today, up from one in seven in 1980.[460]\n Infrastructure Transportation Main article: Transportation in the United States \n     \n The Interstate Highway System, which extends 46,876 miles (75,440 km).[461]\n \n \n \n Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million km) of public roads,[462] including one of the world’s longest highway systems at 57,000 miles (91700 km).[463] The world’s second-largest automobile market,[464] the United States has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans.[465] About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.[466] The average American adult (accounting for all drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling 29 miles (47 km).[467]\n     \n Map showing current rail speeds in the United States.[468]\n \n \n \n Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips.[469][470] Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, partly because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior.[471][472] However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010.[473] Also, light rail development has increased in recent years.[474] Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.[475]\n The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airportsare publicly owned.[476] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[477] Of the world’s 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and the fourth-busiest, O’Hare International Airport in Chicago.[478]\n Energy Further information: Energy policy of the United States \n     \n The U.S. power transmission grid consists of about 300,000 km (190,000 mi) of lines operated by approximately 500 companies. TheNorth American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) oversees all of them.\n \n \n \n The United States energy market is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year.[479] Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons (7076 kg) of oil equivalent per year, the 10th-highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[480]The United States is the world’s largest consumer of petroleum.[481]\n For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception in the wake of a 1979 accident. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants were filed.[482] The United States has 27% of global coal reserves.[483] It is the world’s largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.[484]\n Water supply and sanitation Main article: Water supply and sanitation in the United States \n Issues that affect water supply in the United States include droughts in the West, water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.[485][486][fn 8]\n Education Main article: Education in the United States \n     \n The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of the many public universities in the United States.\n \n \n \n American public education is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end ofhigh school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[489]\n About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children arehomeschooled.[490] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student.[491] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[492]\n The United States has many competitive private and public institutions of higher education. The majority of the world’s top universities listed by different ranking organizations are in the U.S.[493][494][495] There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor’s degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[496] The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.[6][497] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[498]\n As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[491][499] As of 2012, student loan debt exceeded one trillion dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards.[500]\n Culture Main article: Culture of the United States \n See also: Alaska Natives § Cultures, Native American cultures in the United States, Culture of the Native Hawaiians, Social class in the United States, Public holidays in the United States, and Tourism in the United States \n     \n Native Alaskan dancer during the biennial “Celebration” cultural event.\n \n \n \n The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[26][501] Aside from theNative American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries.[502] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from thetraditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[26][503] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[26]\n Core American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism,[504] as well as a unifying belief in an “Americancreed” emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[505]Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times the French figure of 0.14%.[506][507]\n The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[508] Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate.[509][510][511][512][399][513] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[514] scholars identify significant differences between the country’s social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[515] Americans’ self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree.[516] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, beingordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.[517]\n Food Main article: Cuisine of the United States \n     \n Apple pie is a food commonly associated with American cuisine.\n \n \n \n Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour[518] and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers.[519] These home grown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America’s most popular holidays;Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[520]\n     \n Roasted turkey is a traditional menu item of an American Thanksgivingdinner.[521]\n \n \n \n Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[522] Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea.[523] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[524][525]\n American eating habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary roots with some variations. Although American lands could grow newer vegetables England could not, most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by Europeans.[526] Over time American foods changed to a point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in 1972: “Our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence”.[527]\n The American fast food industry, the world’s largest,[528] pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s.[529] Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans’ caloric intake rose 24%;[522] frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American “obesity epidemic“.[530] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake.[531]\n Literature, philosophy, and the arts Main articles: American literature, American philosophy, Architecture of the United States, Visual art of the United States, and American classical music \n     \n Mark Twain, American author and humorist.\n \n \n \n In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century’s second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[532] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville‘s Moby-Dick (1851), Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn(1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald‘s The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee‘s To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)— may be dubbed the “Great American Novel“.[533]\n Twelve U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Bob Dylan in 2016. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingwayand John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[534] Popular literary genres such as theWestern and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[535]\n The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have affected various fields in social and political philosophy.[536][537]\n In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[538]Georgia O’Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and thenpostmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[539]\n     \n Times Square in New York City, the hub of the Broadway theater district[540]\n \n \n \n One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattanentertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O’Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winnersTennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.[541]\n Though little known at the time, Charles Ives‘s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music.Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance, while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers includingAlfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.[542]\n Music Main article: Music of the United States \n     \n The Grammy Award is awarded to leading music artists.\n \n \n \n The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[543]\n Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America’s most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson, andMadonna have become global celebrities,[543] as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears,Katy Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay Z, Eminem and Kanye West.[544] Rock bands such as Metallica, theEagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[545][546][547]\n Cinema Main article: Cinema of the United States \n     \n The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California\n \n \n \n Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[548] The world’s first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison‘s Kinetoscope.[549] The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film‘s development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[550]\n Director D. W. Griffith, American’s top filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[551] Directors such asJohn Ford redefined the image of the American Old West and history, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting, with great influence on subsequent directors. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the “Golden Age of Hollywood“, from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[552] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[553][554] In the 1970s, film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were a vital component in what became known as “New Hollywood” or the “Hollywood Renaissance”,[555] grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[556] Since, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs, and in return, high earnings at the box office, with Cameron’s Avatar (2009) earning more than $2 billion.[557]\n Notable films topping the American Film Institute‘s AFI 100 list include Orson Welles‘s Citizen Kane (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time,[558][559] Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967),On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler’s List (1993), Singin’ in the Rain (1952), It’s a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).[560] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[561] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[562]\n Sports Main article: Sports in the United States \n     \n Swimmer Michael Phelpsand then-President George W. Bush August 10, 2008 at the National Aquatic Center inBeijing. Phelps is the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time.[563][564]\n \n \n \n American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport;[565] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally. Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketballand ice hockey are the country’s next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.[566] In soccer, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men’s national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women’s team has won the FIFA Women’s World Cup three times; Major League Soccer is the sport’s highest league in the United States. The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[567]\n Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. As of 2014, the United States has won 2,400 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 281 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.[568] While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[569] The most watched individual sports are golf and auto racing, particularlyNASCAR.[570][571] The men’s Volleyball national team has won three gold medals at the Olympic Games, one FIVB World Championship, two FIVB Volleyball World Cup, and one FIVB World League.[572]\n Media Main article: Media of the United States \n     \n The corporate headquarters of theAmerican Broadcasting Company in New York City\n \n \n \n The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System(CBS), the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Fox. The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[573] Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[574]\n In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other.) As of September 30, 2014, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the US according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[575]\n Well-known newspapers are The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have “alternative weeklies” to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City’s The Village Voice or Los Angeles’ LA Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.[576] Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo.com, eBay, Amazon and Twitter.[577]\n More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most widely spoken mother tongue behind English.[578][579]\n Science and technology Main articles: Science and technology in the United States and Science policy of the United States \n     \n Astronaut James Irwin walking on the Moon next to Apollo 15‘s landing module and lunar rover in 1971. The effort to reach the Moon was triggered by the Space Race.\n \n \n \n The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid 20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.[580]\n In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison‘s research laboratory, one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[581]The latter lead to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies ofRansom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[582]\n The rise of Nazism in the 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[583] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while theSpace Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and aeronautics.[584][585]\n The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[586][587][588] This in turn led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the county such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computersoftware and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Computer, IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.[589]\n These advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for individual use.[590] As of 2013, 83.8% of American households owned at least onecomputer, and 73.3% had high-speed Internet service.[591] 91% of Americans also own a mobile phone as of May 2013.[592] The United States ranks highly with regard to freedom of use of the internet.[593]\n In the 21st century, 64% of research and development funding comes from the private sector.[594] The United States leads the world in scientific research papers andimpact factor.[595]\n Health See also: Health care in the United States, Health care reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States \n     \n Health spending per capita, in US$ PPP-adjusted, compared amongst various first world nations.\n \n \n \n The United States has a life expectancy of 79.8 years at birth, up from 75.2 years in 1990.[596][597][598] Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere have contributed to lowering the country’s rank in life expectancy from 1987, when it was 11th in the world.[599] Obesity rates in the United States are amongst the highest in the world.[600]\n Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight;[601] the obesity rate, the highest in the industrialized world, has more than doubled in the last quarter-century.[602] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.[603] The infant mortality rate of 6.17 per thousand places the United States 169th-highest out of 224 countries, with the 224th country having the lowest mortality rate.[604]\n In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use.Alzheimer’s disease, drug abuse, kidney disease and cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[598] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[605] U.S. underage drinking among teenagers is among the lowest in industrialized nations.[606]\n The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the EU and Switzerland together contributed to five.[607] Since 1966, more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.[608] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.[609]\n Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance.[610] The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[611][612] In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[613] Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.[614][615]\n See also    United States portal \n  North America portal \n  \n       Book: United States\n       Index of United States-related articles\n Lists of U.S. state topics\n Outline of the United States\n  \n Notes    Jump up^ The five major territories are American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. There are eleven smaller island areas without permanent populations: Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island,Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, and Palmyra Atoll. U.S. sovereignty over Bajo Nuevo Bank, Navassa Island, Serranilla Bank, and Wake Island is disputed.[20] \n  Jump up^ The following two primary sources (non-mirrored) represent the range (min./max.) of total area for China and the United States. Both sources excludeTaiwan from the area of China.   The Encyclopædia Britannica lists China as world’s third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) with a total area of 9,572,900 sq km,[22] and the United States as fourth-largest at 9,526,468 sq km. The figure for the United States is less than in the CIA Factbook because it excludescoastal and territorial waters.[23]\n The CIA World Factbook lists the United States as the third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) with total area of 9,833,517 sq km,[24]and China as fourth-largest at 9,596,960 sq km.[25] This figure for the United States is greater than in the Encyclopædia Britannica because itincludes coastal and territorial waters.\n  \n \n  Jump up^ The United States has a very diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[202] German Americans are the largest ethnic group (more than 50 million) – followed by Irish Americans (circa 37 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans (circa 28 million).[203][204]White Americans are the largest racial group; black Americans are the nation’s largest racial minority (note that in the U.S. Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans are counted as an ethnic group, not a “racial” group), and third-largest ancestry group.[202] Asian Americans are the country’s second-largest racial minority; the three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans,Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans.[202] \n  Jump up^ Fertility is also a factor; in 2010 the average Hispanic woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her lifetime, compared to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic white women (both below the replacement rate of 2.1).[218]Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 36.3% of the population in 2010 (this is nearly 40% in 2015),[219] and over 50% of children under age one,[220] and are projected to constitute the majority by 2042.[221] This contradicts the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports, based on the U.S. census data, which concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386 in 2010) of births were non-Hispanic white.[218]The Hispanic birth rate plummeted 25% between 2006 and 2013 while the rate for non-Hispanics decreased just 5%.[222] \n  Jump up^ Source: 2010 American Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau.

Indeed, World War II ushered in the zenith of U.S. power in what came to be called theAmerican Century, as Leffler 2010, p. 67, indicates: “Truman presided over the greatest military and economic power the world had ever known. War production had lifted the United States out of the Great Depression and had inaugurated an era of unimagined prosperity. Gross national product increased by 60 percent during the war, total earnings by 50 percent. Despite social unrest, labor agitation, racial conflict, and teenage vandalism, Americans had more discretionary income than ever before. Simultaneously, the U.S. government had built up the greatest war machine in human history. By the end of 1942, the United States was producing more arms than all the Axis states combined, and, in 1943, it made almost three times more armaments than did the Soviet Union. In 1945, the United States had two-thirds of the world’s gold reserves, three-fourths of its invested capital, half of its shipping vessels, and half of its manufacturing capacity. Its GNP was three times that of the Soviet Union and more than five times that of Britain. It was also nearing completion of the atomic bomb, a technological and production feat of huge costs and proportions.” \n  Jump up^ “The United States and the Founding of the United Nations, August 1941 – October 1945”.

The Linux operating system is based on it and deployed on both traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers, usually in the form of Linux distributions,[9] and on various embedded devices such as routers, wireless access points,PBXes, set-top boxes, FTA receivers, smart TVs, PVRs and NAS appliances. The Android operating system fortablet computers, smartphones and smartwatches is also based atop the Linux kernel. While the adoption ondesktop computers is low, Linux-based operating systems dominate nearly every other segment of computing, from mobile devices to mainframes. As of November 2016, all but two of the world’s 500 most powerful supercomputers run Linux.\n The Linux kernel was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds[10] for his personal computer and with no cross-platform intentions, but has since expanded to support a huge array of computer architectures, many more than other operating systems or kernels. Linux rapidly attracted developers and users who adopted it as the kernel for other free software projects, notably the GNU Operating System.[11] The Linux kernel has received contributions from nearly 12,000 programmers from more than 1,200 companies, including some of the largest software and hardware vendors.[12][13]\n The Linux kernel API, the application programming interface (API) through which user programs interact with the kernel, is meant to be very stable and to not break userspace programs (some programs, such as those with GUIs, rely on other APIs as well). As part of the kernel’s functionality, device drivers control the hardware; “mainlined” device drivers are also meant to be very stable. However, the interface between the kernel andloadable kernel modules (LKMs), unlike in many other kernels and operating systems, is not meant to be very stable by design.[14]\n The Linux kernel, developed by contributors worldwide, is a prominent example of free and open source software.[15] Day-to-day development discussions take place on the Linux kernel mailing list (LKML). The Linux kernel is released under the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2),[6][16] with some firmware imagesreleased under various non-free licenses.[8]\n   Contents  [hide] \n \n   1History  1.1Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate\n 1.2Popularity\n  \n  2Legal aspects   2.1Licensing terms  2.1.1GPL version 3\n  \n 2.2Loadable kernel modules\n 2.3Firmware binary blobs\n 2.4Trademark\n 2.5SCO litigation\n  \n  3Architecture  3.1Programming language\n 3.2Compiler compatibility\n  3.3Interfaces  3.3.1Kernel-to-userspace API\n 3.3.2Kernel-to-userspace ABI\n 3.3.3In-kernel API\n 3.3.4In-kernel ABI\n  \n  3.4Technical features  3.4.1Preemption\n 3.4.2Portability\n 3.4.3Kernel panic and oopses\n 3.4.4Live patching\n  \n 3.5Security\n 3.6Feature history\n  \n  4Development  4.1Developer community\n 4.2Codebase\n 4.3Estimated cost to redevelop\n  4.4Development model  4.4.1Relation with Linux distributions\n  \n  4.5Maintenance  4.5.1Releases before 2.6.0\n 4.5.22.6.x.y releases\n 4.5.33.x.y releases\n 4.5.44.x.y releases\n  \n 4.6Revision control\n 4.7Version numbering\n 4.8Timeline\n 4.9Variants\n  \n 5See also\n 6Notes\n 7References\n 8Further reading\n 9External links\n  \n  History[edit]      \n Linus Torvalds\n \n \n \n See also: History of Linux \n In April 1991, Linus Torvalds, at the time a 21-year-old computer science student at the University of Helsinki, Finland, started working on some simple ideas for an operating system. He started with a task switcher in Intel 80386 assembly language and a terminal driver. On 25 August 1991, Torvalds posted the following to comp.os.minix, a newsgroup onUsenet:[17]\n  I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) ATclones. This has been brewing since April, and is starting to get ready. I’d like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).\n I’ve currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I’ll get something practical within a few months […] Yes – it’s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that’s all I have :-(.\n […] It’s mostly in C, but most people wouldn’t call what I write C. It uses every conceivable feature of the 386 I could find, as it was also a project to teach me about the 386. As already mentioned, it uses a MMU, for both paging (not to disk yet) and segmentation. It’s the segmentation that makes it REALLY 386 dependent (every task has a 64Mb segment for code &amp; data – max 64 tasks in 4Gb. Anybody who needs more than 64Mb/task – tough cookies). […] Some of my “C”-files (specifically mm.c) are almost as much assembler as C. […] Unlike minix, I also happen to LIKE interrupts, so interrupts are handled without trying to hide the reason behind them.\n  After that, many people contributed code to the project. Early on, the MINIX community contributed code and ideas to the Linux kernel. At the time, the GNU Projecthad created many of the components required for a free operating system, but its own kernel, GNU Hurd, was incomplete and unavailable. The BSD operating system had not yet freed itself from legal encumbrances. Despite the limited functionality of the early versions, Linux rapidly accumulated developers and users.\n By September 1991, version 0.01 of the Linux kernel was released on the FTP server (ftp.funet.fi) of the Finnish University and Research Network (FUNET). It had 10,239 lines of code. In October 1991, version 0.02 of the Linux kernel was released.[18]\n In December 1991, Linux kernel 0.11 was released. This version was the first to be self-hosted as Linux kernel 0.11 could be compiled by a computer running the same kernel version. When Torvalds released version 0.12 in February 1992, he adopted the GNU General Public License (GPL) over his previous self-drafted license, which had not permitted commercial redistribution.[19]\n A newsgroup known as alt.os.linux was started, and on 19 January 1992, the first post to alt.os.linux was made.[20] On 31 March 1992, alt.os.linux becamecomp.os.linux.[21]\n The X Window System was soon ported to Linux. In March 1992, Linux version 0.95 was the first to be capable of running X. This large version number jump (from 0.1x to 0.9x) was due to a feeling that a version 1.0 with no major missing pieces was imminent. However, this proved to be somewhat overoptimistic, and from 1993 to early 1994, 15 development versions of version 0.99 appeared.\n On 14 March 1994, Linux kernel 1.0.0 was released, with 176,250 lines of code. In March 1995, Linux kernel 1.2.0 was released, with 310,950 lines of code.\n Version 2 of the Linux kernel, released on 9 June 1996, was followed by additional major versions under the version 2 header:\n  25 January 1999 – release of Linux kernel 2.2.0 (1,800,847 lines of code)\n 18 December 1999 – IBM mainframe patches for 2.2.13 were published, allowing Linux kernel to be used on enterprise-class machines\n 4 January 2001 – release of Linux kernel 2.4.0 (3,377,902 lines of code)\n 17 December 2003 – release of Linux kernel 2.6.0 (5,929,913 lines of code)\n  Starting in 2004, the release process changed and new kernels started coming out on a regular schedule every 2–3 months, numbered 2.6.0, 2.6.1, up through 2.6.39.\n On 21 July 2011, Torvalds announced the release of Linux kernel 3.0: “Gone are the 2.6.&lt;bignum&gt; days”.[22] The version bump is not about major technological changes when compared to Linux 2.6.39;[23] it marks the kernel’s 20th anniversary.[24] The time-based release process remained the same.\n Version 3.10 of the Linux kernel, released in June 2013, contains 15,803,499 lines of code,[25] while the version 4.1, released in June 2015, has grown to over 19.5 million lines of code contributed by almost 14,000 programmers.[26]\n  Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate[edit]  Main article: Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate \n The fact that Linux is a monolithic kernel rather than a microkernel was the topic of a debate between Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the creator of MINIX, and Linus Torvalds.[27] The debate, started in 1992 on the Usenet discussion group comp.os.minix, was about Linux and kernel architecture in general.[28] Tanenbaum argued that microkernels are superior to monolithic kernels and that therefore Linux is obsolete. Unlike traditional monolithic kernels, device drivers in Linux are easily configured as loadable kernel modules and are loaded or unloaded while running the system. This subject was revisited on 9 May 2006,[29] and on 12 May 2006 Tanenbaum wrote a position statement.[30]\n  Popularity[edit]  The huge rise in popularity of the Android operating system, which includes the Linux kernel, has made the kernel the most popular choice for mobile devices, rivaling the installed base of all other operating systems.[31][32][33] Including previous years, three billion Android smartphones were estimated to have been sold by the end of 2014.\n Some consumer routers also use the Linux kernel,[34] which is also the case for a wide variety of other devices, such as servers, smart TVs, and other non-Android embedded systems. The kernel’s use in traditional (non-server) desktop Linux varieties is dominant, but the usage share of Linux itself is low in comparison to other operating systems.\n  Legal aspects[edit]   Licensing terms[edit]  Initially, Torvalds released Linux under a license which forbade any commercial use.[35] This was changed in version 0.12 to the GNU General Public License(GPL).[19] This license allows distribution and sale of possibly modified and unmodified versions of Linux but requires that all those copies be released under the same license and be accompanied by the complete corresponding source code.\n Torvalds has described licensing Linux under the GPL as the “best thing I ever did.”[35]\n  GPL version 3[edit]  The Linux kernel is licensed explicitly only under version 2 of the GPL,[6] without offering the licensee the option to choose “any later version”, which is a common GPL extension. There was a debate over how easily it could be changed to use later GPL versions such as version 3 and whether this is even desirable.[36] Torvalds himself specifically indicated upon the release of version 2.4.0 that his own code is only under version 2.[37] However, the terms of the GPL state that if no version is specified, then any version may be used,[verification needed] and Alan Cox pointed out that very few other Linux contributors have specified a particular version of the GPL.[38]\n In September 2006, a survey of 29 key kernel programmers indicated that 28 preferred GPLv2 to the then-current GPLv3 draft. Torvalds commented, “I think a number of outsiders… believed that I personally was just the odd man out, because I’ve been so publicly not a huge fan of the GPLv3.”[39] This group of high-profile kernel developers, including Linus Torvalds, Greg Kroah-Hartman and Andrew Morton, commented on mass media about their objections to the GPLv3.[40] They referred to clauses regarding DRM/tivoization, patents, “additional restrictions” and warned a Balkanisation of the “Open Source Universe” by the GPLv3.[40][41] Linus Torvalds, who decided not to adopt the GPLv3 for the Linux kernel, reiterated his criticism even years later.[42]\n  Loadable kernel modules[edit]  It is debated whether loadable kernel modules (LKMs) are to be considered derivative works under copyright law, and thereby fall under the terms of the GPL.\n Torvalds has stated his belief that LKMs using only a limited, “public” subset of the kernel interfaces can sometimes be non-derived works, thus allowing some binary-only drivers and other LKMs that are not licensed under the GPL.[citation needed] A very good example for this is the usage of dma_buf by the proprietary Nvidiagraphics drivers. dma_buf is a recent kernel feature (like the rest of the kernel, it is licensed under the GPL) that allows multiple GPUs to quickly copy data into each other’s framebuffers.[43] One possible use case would be Nvidia Optimus that pairs a fast GPU with an Intel integrated GPU, where the Nvidia GPU writes into the Intelframebuffer when it is active. But, Nvidia cannot use this infrastructure because it uses a technical means to enforce the rule that it can only be used by LKMs that are also GPL. Alan Cox replied on LKML, rejecting a request from one of their engineers to remove this technical enforcement from the API.[44] Not all Linux kernel contributors agree with this interpretation, however, and even Torvalds agrees that many LKMs are clearly derived works, and indeed he writes that “kernel modules ARE derivative ‘by default'”.[45]\n On the other hand, Torvalds has also said that “one gray area in particular is something like a driver that was originally written for another operating system (i.e. clearly not a derived work of Linux in origin). […] THAT is a gray area, and _that_ is the area where I personally believe that some modules may be considered to not be derived works simply because they weren’t designed for Linux and don’t depend on any special Linux behaviour.”[46] Proprietary graphics drivers, in particular, are heavily discussed. Ultimately, it is likely that such questions can only be resolved by a court.\n  Firmware binary blobs[edit]  One point of licensing controversy is the use of firmware “binary blobs” in Linux kernel to support several hardware devices. These files are under a variety of licenses, out of which many are restrictive and their exact underlying source code is usually unknown.[8]\n In 2002, Richard Stallman stated why, in his point of view, such blobs make the Linux kernel partially non-free software, and that distributing Linux kernel “violates the GPL”, which requires “complete corresponding source code” to be available.[7] In 2008, Free Software Foundation Latin America started Linux-libre as a project that creates a completely free variant of the Linux kernel without proprietary objects; it is used by certain completely free Linux distributions, such as those endorsed by the Free Software Foundation, while it can also be used on most distributions.[47]\n On 15 December 2010, the Debian Project announced that the next Debian stable version “6.0 Squeeze” would come with a kernel “stripped of all non-free firmware bits”.[48] This policy was continued to be applied in later stable Debian releases.\n  Trademark[edit]  See also: Linux: Copyright, trademark, and naming \n Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the United States and some other countries. This is the result of an incident in which William Della Croce, Jr., who was not involved in the Linux project, trademarked the name and subsequently demanded royalties for its use.[49] Several Linux backers retained legal counsel and filed suit against Della Croce. The issue was settled in August 1997 when the trademark was assigned to Linus Torvalds.[50][51]\n  SCO litigation[edit]  For more details on this topic, see SCO-Linux controversies.\n In March 2003, the SCO Group (SCO) filed a lawsuit against IBM claiming that IBM had violated copyrights that SCO claimed to hold over the Unix source code, by contributing portions of that code to Linux. Additionally, SCO sent letters to a number of companies warning that their use of Linux without a license from SCO may be a violation of copyright law, and claimed in the press that they would be suing individual Linux users. IBM then promised to defend its Linux customers on their behalf. This controversy has generated lawsuits by SCO against Novell, DaimlerChrysler (partially dismissed in July 2004), and AutoZone, and retaliatory lawsuits by Red Hat and others against SCO.\n In early 2007, SCO filed the specific details of the purported copyright infringement. Despite previous claims that SCO was the rightful owner of 1 million lines of code, they specified 326 lines of code, most of which were uncopyrightable.[52] In August 2007, the court in the Novell case ruled that SCO did not actually own the Unix copyrights to begin with,[53] though the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in August 2009 that the question of who owned the copyright properly remained for a jury to answer.[54] The jury case was decided on 30 March 2010 in Novell’s favour.[55]\n  Architecture[edit]  See also: vmlinux \n     \n Map of the Linux kernel\n \n \n \n     \n Linux kernel supports various hardware architectures, providing a common platform for running free, open-source and proprietary software.\n \n \n \n The Linux kernel is a monolithic kernel, supporting true preemptive multitasking (both in user mode and, since the 2.6 series, in kernel mode[56][57]), virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared copy-on-writeexecutables (via KSM), memory management, the Internet protocol suite, and threading.\n Device drivers and kernel extensions run in kernel space (ring 0 in many CPU architectures), with full access to the hardware, although some exceptions run in user space, for example filesystems based on FUSE/CUSE, and parts of UIO.[58][59] The graphics system most people use with Linux does not run within the kernel. Unlike standard monolithic kernels, device drivers are easily configured as modules, and loaded or unloaded while the system is running. Also, unlike standard monolithic kernels, device drivers can be pre-empted under certain conditions; this feature was added to handle hardware interrupts correctly, and to better support symmetric multiprocessing.[57] By choice, the Linux kernel has no binary kernel interface.[60]\n The hardware is also incorporated into the file hierarchy. Device drivers interface to user applications via an entry in the /dev or /sys directories.[61] Process information as well is mapped to the file system through the/proc directory.[61]\n  Various layers within Linux, also showing separation between the userland and kernel space    User mode User applications For example, bash, LibreOffice, Apache OpenOffice, Blender, 0 A.D., Mozilla Firefox, etc.   Low-level system components:  Systemdaemons:\n systemd, runit, logind, networkd,soundd, …   Windowing system:\n X11, Wayland,Mir,SurfaceFlinger(Android)   Other libraries:\n GTK+, Qt, EFL, SDL, SFML,FLTK, GNUstep, etc.  Graphics:\n Mesa,AMD Catalyst, …   C standard library  open(), exec(), sbrk(), socket(), fopen(), calloc(), … (up to 2000subroutines)\n glibc aims to be POSIX/SUS-compatible, uClibc targets embedded systems,bionic written for Android, etc.   Kernel mode Linux kernel  stat, splice, dup, read, open, ioctl, write, mmap, close, exit, etc. (about 380 system calls)\n The Linux kernel System Call Interface (SCI, aims to be POSIX/SUS-compatible)    Process scheduling\n subsystem IPC\n subsystem  Memory management\n subsystem Virtual files\n subsystem Network\n subsystem   Other components: ALSA, DRI, evdev, LVM, device mapper, Linux Network Scheduler, Netfilter\n Linux Security Modules: SELinux, TOMOYO, AppArmor, Smack    Hardware (CPU, main memory, data storage devices, etc.)     Programming language[edit]  The Linux kernel is written in the version of the C programming language supported by GCC (which has introduced a number of extensions and changes to standard C), together with a number of short sections of code written in the assembly language (in GCC’s “AT&amp;T-style” syntax) of the target architecture. Because of the extensions to C it supports, GCC was for a long time the only compiler capable of correctly building the Linux kernel.\n  Compiler compatibility[edit]  GCC is the default compiler for the Linux kernel source. In 2004, Intel claimed to have modified the kernel so that its C compiler was also capable of compiling it.[62]There was another such reported success in 2009, with a modified 2.6.22 version of the kernel.[63][64]\n Since 2010, effort has been underway to build the Linux kernel with Clang, an alternative compiler for the C language;[65] as of 12 April 2014, the official kernel could almost be compiled by Clang.[66][67] The project dedicated to this effort is named LLVMLinux after the LLVM compiler infrastructure upon which Clang is built.[68]LLVMLinux does not aim to fork either the Linux kernel or the LLVM, therefore it is a meta-project composed of patches that are eventually submitted to the upstream projects. By enabling the Linux kernel to be compiled by Clang that, among other advantages, is known for faster compilation compared with GCC, kernel developers may benefit from a faster workflow due to shorter compilation times.[69]\n  Interfaces[edit]  Main articles: Linux kernel interfaces and Interfaces of the Linux kernel (Category) \n     \n  This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (January 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)        \n Four interfaces are distinguished: two internal to the kernel, and two between the kernel and userspace.\n \n \n \n     \n At XDC2014, Alex Deucher from AMD announced the unified kernel-mode driver.[70] The proprietary Linux graphic driver, libGL-fglrx-glx, will share the same DRM infrastructure with Mesa 3D. As there is no stable in-kernel ABI, AMD had to constantly adapt the former binary blob used by Catalyst.\n \n \n \n Conformance to standards is a general policy for the Linux kernel’s internals. Another rule is that a kernel component is not accepted into the Linux kernel mainline if there is only proprietary user-space software using that component.[citation needed]\n  Kernel-to-userspace API[edit]  Main articles: POSIX and Single UNIX Specification \n Source code portability ensures that a C program written by conforming to a standard can be successfully compiled and run on any system that also conforms to the same standard. The relevant standards, aiming to achieve source code portability of programs, that the development of the Linux kernel, the GNU C Library, and associated utilities tries to adhere to, are POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification. However, as of February 2014, no Linux distributions are branded as “UNIX” by The Open Group, mainly because of the costs of the conformance testing.\n The Linux kernel API of the Linux kernel, representing the kernel’s system call interface, is composed of the available system calls.\n  Kernel-to-userspace ABI[edit]  Main article: Linux Standard Base \n Binary portability shall guarantee that any program once compiled for a given hardware platform, can be run in its compiled form on any other hardware platform that conforms to the standard. Binary portability is an essential requirement for the commercial viability of independent software vendor (ISV) applications built for the operating systems based on the Linux kernel. Binary compatibility is much more demanding than source code portability; as of February 2014, the only standard concerning itself with binary compatibility is the Linux Standard Base(LSB).\n  In-kernel API[edit]  There are a couple of kernel internal APIs utilized between the different subsystems and subsystems of subsystems. Some of them have been kept stable over several releases, other have not. There are no guarantees regarding the in-kernel APIs. Maintainers and contributors are free to augment or change them at any time.[71]\n Examples of in-kernel APIs include software frameworks/APIs for the following classes of device drivers:\n   Video4Linux – for video capture hardware\n  Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) – for sound cards\n  New API – for network interface controllers \n  Direct Rendering Manager – for graphics accelerators\n  KMS driver – for display controllers \n  mac80211 – for wireless network interface controllers[72] \n WEXT – for wireless network interface controllers (obsolete).\n   In-kernel ABI[edit]  Some organizations have strongly supported defining and maintaining of a stable in-kernel ABI over several releases.[citation needed] For example, it would benefit hardware manufactures which release proprietary kernel modules and distribute binary-only software (e.g. device drivers).[citation needed] However, the Linux kernel developers choose not to maintain a stable in-kernel ABI.[73] This allows Linux kernel development to happen much more quickly.[citation needed]\n  Technical features[edit]   Preemption[edit]  See also: Kernel preemption \n     \n The position of I/O schedulers within various layers of the Linux kernel’s storage stack.[74]\n \n \n \n The Linux kernel provides preemptive scheduling under certain conditions. Until kernel version 2.4, only user processes were preemptive, i.e., in addition to time quantum expiration, an execution of current process in user mode would be interrupted if higher dynamic priority processes entered TASK_RUNNING state.[75] Toward 2.6 series of the Linux kernel, an ability to interrupt a task executing kernel code was added, although with that not all sections of the kernel code can be preempted.[76]\n The Linux kernel contains different scheduler classes.[77] By default the kernel uses a scheduler mechanism called the Completely Fair Scheduler introduced in the 2.6.23 version of the kernel.[78] Internally this default-scheduler class is also known asSCHED_OTHER, but the kernel also contains two POSIX-compliant[79] real-time scheduling classes named SCHED_FIFO (realtime first-in-first-out) and SCHED_RR (realtime round-robin), both of which take precedence over the default class.[77]\n Through the use of the real-time Linux kernel patch PREEMPT_RT, support for full preemption of critical sections, interrupt handlers, and “interrupt disable” code sequences can be supported.[80] Partial mainline integration of the real-time Linux kernel patch already brought some functionality to the kernel mainline.[81] Preemption improves latency, increases responsiveness, and makes Linux more suitable for desktop and real-timeapplications. Older versions of the kernel had a so-called big kernel lock for synchronization across the entire kernel, which was finally removed by Arnd Bergmann in 2011.[82]\n Additional scheduling policy known as SCHED_DEADLINE, implementing the earliest deadline first algorithm (EDF), was added in kernel version 3.14, released on 30 March 2014.[83][84]\n  Portability[edit]  See also: List of Linux supported architectures and Linux-powered device \n     \n An iPod booting iPodLinux\n \n \n \n While not originally designed to be portable,[17][85] Linux is now one of the most widely ported operating system kernels, running on a diverse range of systems from the ARM architecture to IBM Z/Architecture mainframe computers. The first port beyond Linux’s original 386 architecture was to the Motorola 68000 platform by Amiga users, but to do this port they replaced major parts of the kernel, leading Torvalds to call it a fork and a “Linux-like operating system”.[85] With this experience in mind, Torvalds led a major restructure of the kernel code to facilitate the next port effort, to the DEC Alpha AXP platform, and support both 386 and Alpha in a single source tree.[85]\n Linux runs as the main operating system on IBM’s Blue Gene and other fastest supercomputers. As of June 2016, 99+% of the world’s 500 fastest supercomputers run some variant of Linux,[86] including the top 280.[87] Linux has also been ported to various handheld devices such as Apple’s iPod and iPhone.[88] Some operating systems developed for mobile phones use modified versions of the Linux kernel, including Google Android, Firefox OS, HP webOS, and Nokia Maemo.[89][90][91]\n  Kernel panic and oopses[edit]      \n An example of Linux kernel panic\n \n \n \n Main articles: Kernel panic and Linux kernel oops \n In Linux, a “panic” is an unrecoverable system error detected by the kernel, as opposed to similar errors detected by user space code. It is possible for kernel code to indicate such a condition by calling the panic function located in the header filesys/system.h. However, most panics are the result of unhandled processor exceptions in kernel code, such as references to invalid memory addresses. These are typically indicative of a bug somewhere in the call chain leading to the panic. They can also indicate a failure of hardware, such as a failed RAM cell or errors in arithmetic functions in the processor caused by a processor bug, overheating/damaged processor, or a soft error.\n A report of a non-fatal bug in the kernel is called an “oops“; such deviations from correct behavior of the Linux kernel may allow continued operation with compromised reliability.[92] These crash reports are automatically collected and can be sent upstream by various software, such as kerneloops,[93] ABRT (Fedora)[94] and apport (Ubuntu). KernelOops.org collected these reports and published statistics on their website.[95]\n The kernel panic message might not be printed visibly in some conditions, such as when using a graphical desktop. To debug such conditions, other methods such as attaching a serial port console can be used.\n  Live patching[edit]  Rebootless updates can even be applied to the kernel by using live patching technologies such as Ksplice, kpatch and kGraft. Minimalistic foundations for live kernel patching were merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 4.0, which was released on 12 April 2015. Those foundations, known as livepatch and based primarily on the kernel’s ftrace functionality, form a common core capable of supporting hot patching by both kGraft and kpatch, by providing an application programming interface (API) for kernel modules that contain hot patches and an application binary interface (ABI) for the userspace management utilities. However, the common core included into Linux kernel 4.0 supports only the x86 architecture and does not provide any mechanisms for ensuring function-level consistency while the hot patches are applied. As of April 2015, there is ongoing work on porting kpatch and kGraft to the common live patching core provided by the Linux kernel mainline.[96][97][98]\n  Security[edit]  Computer security is a much-publicized topic in relation to the Linux kernel because a large portion of the kernel bugs present potential security flaws. For example, they may allow for privilege escalation or create denial-of-service attack vectors. Over the years, numerous such flaws were found and fixed in the Linux kernel.[99]New security features are frequently implemented to improve the Linux kernel’s security.[100][101]\n Critics have accused kernel developers of covering up security flaws or at least not announcing them; in 2008, Linus Torvalds responded to this with the following:[102][103]\n I personally consider security bugs to be just “normal bugs”. I don’t cover them up, but I also don’t have any reason what-so-ever to think it’s a good idea to track them and announce them as something special…one reason I refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that I think it glorifies—and thus encourages—the wrong behavior. It makes “heroes” out of security people, as if the people who don’t just fix normal bugs aren’t as important. In fact, all the boring normal bugs are way more important, just because there’s a lot more of them. I don’t think some spectacular security hole should be glorified or cared about as being any more “special” than a random spectacular crash due to bad locking.\n Linux distributions typically release security updates to fix vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. Many offer long-term support releases that receive security updates for a certain Linux kernel version for an extended period of time.\n  Feature history[edit]  Version 1.0 of the Linux kernel was released on 14 March 1994.[104] This release of the Linux kernel only supported single-processor i386-based computer systems. Portability became a concern, and so version 1.2 (released 7 March 1995)[105] gained support for computer systems using processors based on the Alpha, SPARC, and MIPS architectures.\n Version 2.0 was released on 9 June 1996.[106] There were 41 releases in the series. The major feature of 2.0 was SMP support (that is, support for multiple processors in a single system) and support for more types of processors.\n Version 2.2, released on 20 January 1999,[107] removed the global spinlock and provided improved SMP support, added support for the m68k and PowerPCarchitectures, and added new file systems (including read-only support for Microsoft‘s NTFS).[108]\n Version 2.4.0, released on 4 January 2001,[109] contained support for ISA Plug and Play, USB, and PC Cards.[110] It also included support for the PA-RISC processor from Hewlett-Packard. Development for 2.4.x changed a bit in that more features were made available throughout the duration of the series, including: support forBluetooth, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) version 1, RAID support, InterMezzo and ext3 file systems.\n Version 2.6.0 was released on 17 December 2003.[111] The development for 2.6.x changed further towards including new features throughout the duration of the series. Among the changes that have been made in the 2.6 series are: integration of μClinux into the mainline kernel sources, PAE support, support for several new lines of CPUs, integration of Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) into the mainline kernel sources, support for up to 232 users (up from 216), support for up to 229 process IDs (64-bit only, 32-bit arches still limited to 215),[112] substantially increased the number of device types and the number of devices of each type, improved 64-bit support, support for file systems which support file sizes of up to 16 terabytes, in-kernel preemption, support for the Native POSIX Thread Library(NPTL), User-mode Linux integration into the mainline kernel sources, SELinux integration into the mainline kernel sources, InfiniBand support, and considerably more. Also notable are the addition of several file systems throughout the 2.6.x releases: FUSE, JFS, XFS, ext4 and more. Details on the history of the 2.6 kernel series can be found in the ChangeLog files on the 2.6 kernel series source code release area of kernel.org.[113]\n Version 3.0 was released on 22 July 2011.[22] On 30 May 2011, Torvalds announced that the big change was “NOTHING. Absolutely nothing.” and asked “…let’s make sure we really make the next release not just an all new shiny number, but a good kernel too.”[114] After the expected 6–7 weeks of the development process, it would be released near the 20th anniversary of Linux.\n In December 2012, Torvalds decided to reduce kernel complexity by removing support for i386 processors, making the 3.7 kernel series the last one still supporting the original processor.[115][116] The same series unified support for the ARM processor.[117]\n Version 3.11, released on 2 September 2013,[118] adds many new features such as new O_TMPFILE flag for open(2) to reduce temporary file vulnerabilities, experimental AMD Radeon dynamic power management, low-latency network polling, and zswap (compressed swap cache).[119]\n There were no meaningful technical reasons for the numbering change from 2.6.39 to 3.0, or from 3.19 to 4.0. The major version number was increased just to avoid large minor numbers.[22][120]\n  Development[edit]  \n  Developer community[edit]  As of 2007, the development of the kernel had shifted from the top 20 most active developers writing 80% of the code to the top 30 writing 30% of the code, with top developers spending more time reviewing changes.[121] Developers can also be categorized by affiliation; in 2007, the top category was unknown while the top corporation was Red Hat with 12% of contributions, and known amateurs at 3.9%.[121] The kernel changes made in year 2007 have been submitted by over 1900 developers, which may be a significant underestimate because developers working in teams usually count as one.[citation needed] It is generally assumed that the community of Linux kernel developers comprises 5000 or 6000 members.\n  Codebase[edit]  As of 2013, the 3.10 release of the Linux kernel had 15,803,499 lines of code. As of 2007, roughly 5% of the code is part of the “core” while 52% is drivers.[121]\n  Instead of a roadmap, there are technical guidelines. Instead of a central resource allocation, there are persons and companies who all have a stake in the further development of the Linux kernel, quite independently from one another: People like Linus Torvalds and I don’t plan the kernel evolution. We don’t sit there and think up the roadmap for the next two years, then assign resources to the various new features. That’s because we don’t have any resources. The resources are all owned by the various corporations who use and contribute to Linux, as well as by the various independent contributors out there. It’s those people who own the resources who decide…\n — Andrew Morton, 2005\n   Linux is evolution, not intelligent design!\n — Linus Torvalds, 2005[122][123]\n  By this statement it is meant that evolution often does odd (and “sub-optimal”) things exactly because it does incremental changes which do not break at any point. As a result, any released version of the Linux kernel is fully usable, even if, for example, device drivers do not support all features of the hardware they are written for.\n The conceptual architecture of the Linux kernel has proved its success, while essential factors for this success were the provision for the organization of developers, and the provision for system extensibility. The Linux kernel’s architecture was required to support many independent volunteer developers, which suggested that the system portions that require the most development—hardware device drivers, file systems and network protocols—be implemented in an extensible fashion. The Linux kernel’s architecture chose to make these systems extensible using a data abstraction technique – each hardware device driver is implemented as a separate module that supports a common interface. In this way, a single developer can add a new device driver, with minimal interaction required with other developers of the Linux kernel.\n Another important extension to the Linux kernel is the addition of more supported hardware platforms. The architecture of the system supports this extensibility by separating all hardware-specific code into distinct modules within each subsystem. In this way, a small group of developers can implement a port of the Linux kernel to a new hardware architecture by re-implementing only the machine-specific portions of the kernel.\n  Estimated cost to redevelop[edit]  The cost to redevelop the Linux kernel version 2.6.0 in a traditional proprietary development setting has been estimated to be US$612 million (€467M, £394M) in 2004 prices using the COCOMO man-month estimation model.[124] In 2006, a study funded by the European Union put the redevelopment cost of kernel version 2.6.8 higher, at €882M ($1.14bn, £744M).[125]\n This topic was revisited in October 2008 by Amanda McPherson, Brian Proffitt and Ron Hale-Evans. Using David A. Wheeler’s methodology, they estimated redevelopment of the 2.6.25 kernel now costs $1.3bn (part of a total $10.8bn to redevelop Fedora 9).[126] Again, Garcia-Garcia and Alonso de Magdaleno from University of Oviedo (Spain) estimate that the value annually added to kernel was about €100M between 2005 and 2007 and €225M in 2008, it would cost also more than €1bn (about $1.4bn as of February 2010) to develop in the European Union.[127]\n As of 7 March 2011, using then-current LOC (lines of code) of a 2.6.x Linux kernel and wage numbers with David A. Wheeler’s calculations it would cost approximately $3bn (about €2.2bn) to redevelop the Linux kernel as it keeps getting bigger.[128]\n  Development model[edit]      \n  This section needs additional citations for verification.

(March 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)    The current development model of the Linux kernel is such that Linus Torvalds makes the releases of new versions, also called the “vanilla” or “mainline” kernels, meaning that they contain the main, generic branch of development. This branch is officially released as a new version approximately every ten weeks, after Torvalds does an initial round of integrating major changes made by all other programmers, and several rounds of bug-fix pre-releases.\n As of 2015, in the current development scheme, the main branch of development is not a traditional “stable” branch; instead, it incorporates all kinds of changes, including both the latest features, and security and bug fixes. For users who do not want to risk updating to new versions containing code that may not be well tested, a separate set of “stable” branches exist, one for each released version, which are meant for people who just want the security and bug fixes, but not a whole new version. These branches are maintained by the stable team (Greg Kroah-Hartman, Chris Wright, and others).\n The development model for the 2.6 kernel series was significantly different compared to the 2.5 series. Before the 2.6 series, there was a stable branch (2.4) where only relatively minor and safe changes were merged, and an unstable branch (2.5), where bigger changes and cleanups were allowed. Both of these branches had been maintained by the same set of people, led by Torvalds. This meant that users would always have a well-tested 2.4 version with the latest security and bug fixes to use, though they would have to wait for the features which went into the 2.5 branch. The downside of this was that the “stable” kernel ended up so far behind that it no longer supported recent hardware and lacked needed features. In the late 2.5 kernel series, some maintainers elected to try backporting of their changes to the stable kernel series, which resulted in bugs being introduced into the 2.4 kernel series. The 2.5 branch was then eventually declared stable and renamed to 2.6. But instead of opening an unstable 2.7 branch, the kernel developers decided to continue putting major changes into the 2.6 branch, which would then be released at a pace faster than 2.4.x but slower than 2.5.x. This had the desirable effect of making new features more quickly available and getting more testing of the new code, which was added in smaller batches and easier to test.\n As a response to the lack of a stable kernel tree where people could coordinate the collection of bug fixes as such, in December 2005 Adrian Bunk announced that he would keep releasing 2.6.16.y kernels when the stable team moved on to 2.6.17.[129][130] He also included some driver updates, making the maintenance of the 2.6.16 series very similar to the old rules for maintenance of a stable series such as 2.4.[131] Since then, the “stable team” had been formed, and it would keep updating kernel versions with bug fixes. In October 2008 Adrian Bunk announced that he will maintain 2.6.27 for a few years as a replacement of 2.6.16.[132] The stable team picked up on the idea and as of 2010 they continue to maintain that version and release bug fixes for it, in addition to others.[133]\n After the change of the development model with 2.6.x, developers continued to want what one might call an unstable kernel tree, one that changes as rapidly as new patches come in. Andrew Morton decided to repurpose his -mm tree from memory management to serve as the destination for all new and experimental code. In September 2007, Morton decided to stop maintaining this tree.[134] In February 2008, Stephen Rothwell created the linux-next tree to serve as a place where patches aimed to be merged during the next development cycle are gathered.[135][136] Several subsystem maintainers also adopted the suffix -next for trees containing code which is meant to be submitted for inclusion in the next release cycle.\n As of January 2014, the in-development version of the Linux kernel is held in an unstable branch named linux-next.[137]\n  Relation with Linux distributions[edit]  Most Linux users run a kernel supplied by their Linux distribution. Some distributions ship the “vanilla” or “stable” kernels. However, several Linux distribution vendors (such as Red Hat and Debian) maintain another set of Linux kernel branches which are integrated into their products. These are usually updated at a slower pace compared to the “vanilla” branch, and they usually include all fixes from the relevant “stable” branch, but at the same time they can also add support for drivers or features which had not been released in the “vanilla” version the distribution vendor started basing their branch from.\n  Maintenance[edit]  While Linus Torvalds supervises code changes and releases to the latest kernel versions, he has delegated the maintenance of older versions to other programmers.[138] Major releases as old as 2.0 (officially made obsolete with the kernel 2.2.0 release in January 1999) are maintained as needed, although at a very slow pace.\n  Releases before 2.6.0[edit]     Version Original release date Current version Maintainer  [show]Support model     2.6.x.y releases[edit]  Versions 2.6.16 and 2.6.27 of the Linux kernel were unofficially supported in a long-term support (LTS) fashion,[146] before a 2011 working group in the Linux Foundation started a formal long-term support initiative.[147][148]\n    Version Original release date Current version Maintainer  [show]Support model     3.x.y releases[edit]     Version[a]  Original release date Current version Maintainer  [show]Support model     4.x.y releases[edit]  Greg Kroah-Hartman, the developer and maintainer of Linux kernel has confirmed that Linux kernel 4.9 will be the next LTS kernel branch.[277]\n    Version[a][b]  Original release date Current version Maintainer  [show]Support model     Revision control[edit]  The Linux kernel source code used to be maintained without the help of an automated source code management system, mostly because of Linus Torvalds’ dislike of centralized SCM systems.\n In 2002, Linux kernel development switched to BitKeeper, an SCM system which satisfied Torvalds’ technical requirements. BitKeeper was made available to Linus and several others free of charge, but was not free software, which was a source of controversy. The system did provide some interoperability with free SCM systems such as CVS and Subversion.\n In April 2005, however, efforts to reverse-engineer the BitKeeper system by Andrew Tridgell led BitMover, the company which maintained BitKeeper, to stop supporting the Linux development community. In response, Torvalds and others wrote a new source code control system for the purpose, called Git. The new system was written within weeks, and in two months the first official kernel release was made using Git.[305] Git soon developed into a separate project in its own right and gained widespread adoption.\n  Version numbering[edit]  The Linux kernel has had three different numbering schemes.\n The first scheme was used in the run-up to “1.0”. The first version of the kernel was 0.01. This was followed by 0.02, 0.03, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12 (the first GPL version), 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.98, 0.99 and then 1.0.[306] From 0.95 on there were many patch releases between versions.\n After the 1.0 release and prior to version 2.6, the number was composed as “a.b.c”, where the number “a” denoted the kernel version, the number “b” denoted the major revision of the kernel, and the number “c” indicated the minor revision of the kernel. The kernel version was changed only when major changes in the code and the concept of the kernel occurred, twice in the history of the kernel: in 1994 (version 1.0) and in 1996 (version 2.0). Version 3.0 was released in 2011, but it was not a major change in kernel concept. The major revision was assigned according to the even–odd version numbering scheme. The minor revision had been changed whenever security patches, bug fixes, new features or drivers were implemented in the kernel.\n In 2004, after version 2.6.0 was released, the kernel developers held several discussions regarding the release and version scheme[307][308] and ultimately Linus Torvalds and others decided that a much shorter “time-based” release cycle would be beneficial. For about seven years, the first two numbers remained “2.6”, and the third number was incremented with each new release, which rolled out after two to three months. A fourth number was sometimes added to account for bug and security fixes (only) to the kernel version. The even-odd system of alternation between stable and unstable was gone. Instead, development pre-releases are titledrelease candidates, which is indicated by appending the suffix ‘-rc’ to the kernel version, followed by an ordinal number.\n The first use of the fourth number occurred when a grave error, which required immediate fixing, was encountered in 2.6.8’s NFS code. However, there were not enough other changes to legitimize the release of a new minor revision (which would have been 2.6.9). So, 2.6.8.1 was released, with the only change being the fix of that error. With 2.6.11, this was adopted as the new official versioning policy. Later it became customary to continuously back-port major bug-fixes and security patches to released kernels and indicate that by updating the fourth number.\n On 29 May 2011, Linus Torvalds announced[309] that the kernel version would be bumped to 3.0 for the release following 2.6.39, due to the minor version number getting too large and to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Linux. It continued the time-based release practice introduced with 2.6.0, but using the second number; for example, 3.1 would follow 3.0 after a few months. An additional number (now the third number) would be added on when necessary to designate security and bug fixes, as for example with 3.0.18; the Linux community refers to this as “3.x.y.z” versioning. The major version number was also later raised to 4, for the release following version 3.19.[310][b]\n In addition to Linus’s “-rc” development releases, sometimes the version will have a suffix such as “tip”, indicating another development branch, usually (but not always) the initials of a person who made it. For example, “ck” stands for Con Kolivas, “ac” stands for Alan Cox, etc. Sometimes, the letters are related to the primary development area of the branch the kernel is built from, for example, “wl” indicates a wireless networking test build. Also, distributors may have their own suffixes with different numbering systems and for back-ports to their “enterprise” (i.e. stable but older) distribution versions.\n  Timeline[edit]    \n \n  Variants[edit]  There are certain variants of the Linux kernel that provide additional functionality, but do not belong to the Linux kernel mainline. Such variants of the Linux kernel include Linux-libre, Compute Node Linux, Cooperative Linux, grsecurity, INK, L4Linux, MkLinux, RTLinux, and User-mode Linux. Some of these variants have been partially merged into the mainline.[311]\n  See also[edit]     Information technology portal \n  Linux portal \n  Open-source software portal \n  Free and open-source software portal \n  \n  Comparison of operating system kernels\n   Notes[edit]     ^ Jump up to:a b There were no meaningful technical reasons for the numbering change from 2.6.39 to 3.0, or from 3.19 to 4.0.

Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2011, it was the world’s largest software maker by revenue,[8] and one of the world’s most valuable companies.[9]\n Microsoft was founded by Paul Allen and Bill Gates on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed byMicrosoft Windows. The company’s 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions. In May 2011, Microsoft acquired Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion,[10] and in December 2016 bought LinkedIn for $26.2 billion.[11]\n As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC-compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.[12] The company also produces a wide range of other software for desktops and servers, and is active in areas including Internet search (withBing), the video game industry (with the Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles), the digital services market (throughMSN), and mobile phones (via the operating systems of Nokia’s former phones[13] and Windows Phone OS). In June 2012, Microsoft entered the personal computer production market for the first time, with the launch of the Microsoft Surface, a line of tablet computers. With the acquisition of Nokia’s devices and services division to form Microsoft Mobile, the company re-entered the smartphone hardware market, after its previous attempt, Microsoft Kin, which resulted from their acquisition of Danger Inc.[14]\n The word “Microsoft” is a portmanteau of “microcomputer” and “software”.[15]\n   Contents  [hide] \n \n   1History  1.11972–1984: Founding and company beginnings\n 1.21984–1994: Windows and Office\n 1.31995–2007: Internet and the 32-bit era\n 1.42007–2011: Windows Vista, mobile, and Windows 7\n 1.52011–2014: Rebranding, Windows 8, Surface and Nokia devices\n  1.62014–present: Windows 10, Minecraft, HoloLens  1.6.1Corporate affairs\n 1.6.2Products\n 1.6.3Services\n  \n  \n  2Businesses  2.1Windows Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division\n 2.2Business Division\n 2.3Entertainment and Devices Division\n 2.4Future Decoded\n  \n  3Corporate affairs  3.1Board of Directors\n 3.2Financial\n 3.3Marketing\n 3.4Layoffs\n 3.5United States government\n  \n  4Corporate identity  4.1Corporate culture\n 4.2Environment\n 4.3Headquarters\n 4.4Flagship stores\n 4.5Logo\n 4.6Sponsorship\n  \n 5See also\n 6References\n 7External links\n  \n History Main articles: History of Microsoft, History of Microsoft Windows, and Timeline of Microsoft \n 1972–1984: Founding and company beginnings     \n Paul Allen and Bill Gates pose for the camera on October 19, 1981, in a sea of PCs after signing a pivotal contract with IBM.[16]:228\n \n \n \n Paul Allen and Bill Gates, childhood friends with a passion for computer programming, sought to make a successful businessutilizing their shared skills.[17] In 1972 they founded their first company, named Traf-O-Data, which offered a rudimentary computer that tracked and analyzed automobile traffic data. Allen went on to pursue a degree in computer science at Washington State University, later dropping out of school to work at Honeywell. Gates began studies at Harvard.[18] The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems‘s (MITS) Altair 8800microcomputer.[19] Allen suggested that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device; after a call from Gates claiming to have a working interpreter, MITS requested a demonstration. Since they didn’t actually have one, Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter. Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device, the interpreter worked flawlessly when they demonstrated the interpreter to MITS in Albuquerque, New Mexico in March 1975; MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.[16]:108, 112–114 They officially established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as the CEO.[20] Allen came up with the original name of “Micro-Soft,” as recounted in a 1995 Fortune magazine article.[21][22] In August 1977 the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office, “ASCII Microsoft“.[23] The company moved to a new home in Bellevue, Washington in January 1979.[20]\n Microsoft entered the OS business in 1980 with its own version of Unix, called Xenix.[24] However, it was MS-DOS that solidified the company’s dominance. After negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS, which was set to be used in the upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).[25] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products, branding it as MS-DOS, which IBM rebranded to PC DOS. Following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981, Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS. Since IBM copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Due to various factors, such as MS-DOS’s available software selection, Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[26][27]:210The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a publishing division named Microsoft Press.[16]:232 Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after developing Hodgkin’s disease.\n 1984–1994: Windows and Office     \n Windows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985 as the first version of the Microsoft Windows line.\n \n \n \n     \n Timeline of Windows\n \n \n \n While jointly developing a new OS with IBM in 1984, OS/2, Microsoft releasedMicrosoft Windows, a graphical extension for MS-DOS, on November 20, 1985.[16]:242–243, 246 Microsoft moved its headquarters to Redmond on February 26, 1986, and on March 13 the company went public;[28] the ensuing rise in the stock would make an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.[29] Due to the partnership with IBM, in 1990 the Federal Trade Commission set its eye on Microsoft for possible collusion; it marked the beginning of over a decade of legal clashes with the U.S. government.[30] Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987;[16]:243–244 meanwhile, the company was at work on a 32-bit OS, Microsoft Windows NT, using ideas from OS/2; it shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and theWin32 application programming interface (API), making porting from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows easier. Once Microsoft informed IBM of NT, the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.[31]\n In 1990, Microsoft introduced its office suite, Microsoft Office. The software bundled separate office productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.[16]:301 On May 22 Microsoft launched Windows 3.0 with a streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386processor.[32] Both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.[33][34] Novell, a Word competitor from 1984–1986, filed a lawsuit years later claiming that Microsoft left part of its APIs undocumented in order to gain a competitive advantage.[35]\n On July 27, 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division filed a Competitive Impact Statement that said, in part: “Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive “per processor” licenses. Under a per processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM’s use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft’s use of per processor licenses has increased.”[36]\n 1995–2007: Internet and the 32-bit era     \n Bill Gates giving his deposition in 1998 for the United States v. Microsofttrial.[30]\n \n \n \n Following Bill Gates’s internal “Internet Tidal Wave memo” on May 26, 1995, Microsoft began to redefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web.[37] The company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely new user interface with a novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the Win32 API.[38][39]:20 Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN (which was at first intended to be a competitor to the Internet), and for OEMs Internet Explorer, a web browser. Internet Explorer was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes because the boxes were printed before the team finished the web browser, and instead was included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack.[40] Branching out into new markets in 1996, Microsoft and NBC Universalcreated a new 24/7 cable news station, MSNBC.[41] Microsoft created Windows CE 1.0, a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints, such as personal digital assistants.[42] In October 1997, the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court, stating that Microsoft violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.[16]:323–324\n     \n In 1996, Microsoft released Windows CE, a version of the operating system meant for personal digital assistants and other tiny computers.\n \n \n \n Bill Gates handed over the CEO position on January 13, 2000, to Steve Ballmer, an old college friend of Gates and employee of the company since 1980, creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect.[16]:111, 228[20] Various companies including Microsoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to, among other things, increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software. Critics decry the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, a form ofdigital rights management; for example the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner, but also secured against its owner as well.[43][44] On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of United States v. Microsoft,[45]calling the company an “abusive monopoly”;[46] it settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2004.[28] On October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP, unifying the mainstream and NT lines under the NT codebase.[47] The company released the Xbox later that year, entering the game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo.[48] In March 2004 theEuropean Union brought antitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its dominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of €497 million ($613 million) and to produce new versions of Windows XP without Windows Media Player, Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N.[49][50]\n 2007–2011: Windows Vista, mobile, and Windows 7     \n CEO Steve Ballmer at the MIX event in 2008. In an interview about his management style in 2005, he mentioned that his first priority was to get the people he delegates to in order. Ballmer also emphasized the need to continue pursuing new technologies even if initial attempts fail, citing the original attempts with Windows as an example.[51]\n \n \n \n Released in January 2007, the next version of Windows, Windows Vista, focused on features, security and a redesigned user interface dubbed Aero.[52][53] Microsoft Office 2007, released at the same time, featured a “Ribbon” user interface which was a significant departure from its predecessors. Relatively strong sales of both titles helped to produce a record profit in 2007.[54] The European Union imposed another fine of €899 million ($1.4 billion) for Microsoft’s lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27, 2008, saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice servers. Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that “these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved”.[55] 2007 also saw the creation of a multi-core unit at Microsoft, as they followed in the steps of server companies such as Sun and IBM.[56]\n Gates retired from his role as Chief Software Architect on June 27, 2008, a decision announced in June 2006, while retaining other positions related to the company in addition to being an advisor for the company on key projects.[57][58] Azure Services Platform, the company’s entry into the cloud computing market for Windows, launched on October 27, 2008.[59] On February 12, 2009, Microsoft announced its intent to open a chain of Microsoft-branded retail stores, and on October 22, 2009, the first retail Microsoft Store opened in Scottsdale, Arizona; the same day the first store opened, Windows 7 was officially released to the public. Windows 7’s focus was on refining Vista with ease of use features and performance enhancements, rather than a large reworking of Windows.[60][61][62]\n As the smartphone industry boomed beginning in 2007, Microsoft struggled to keep up with its rivals Apple and Google in providing a modern smartphone operating system. As a result, in 2010, Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, Windows Mobile, replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS; along with a new strategy in the smartphone industry that had Microsoft working more closely with smartphone manufacturers, such as Nokia, and to provide a consistent user experience across all smartphones using Microsoft’s Windows Phone OS. It used a new user interface design language, codenamed “Metro”, which prominently used simple shapes, typography and iconography, and the concept of minimalism. Microsoft is a founding member of the Open Networking Foundation started on March 23, 2011. Other founding companies include Google, HP Networking, Yahoo, Verizon, Deutsche Telekom and 17 other companies. The nonprofit organization is focused on providing support for a new cloud computing initiative called Software-Defined Networking.[63] The initiative is meant to speed innovation through simple software changes in telecommunications networks, wireless networks, data centers and other networking areas.[64]\n 2011–2014: Rebranding, Windows 8, Surface and Nokia devices     \n Start screen on Windows 8.1\n \n \n \n     \n Surface Pro 3, part of the Surfaceseries of laplets by Microsoft\n \n \n \n Following the release of Windows Phone, Microsoft underwent a gradual rebranding of its product range throughout 2011 and 2012—the corporation’s logos, products, services and websites adopted the principles and concepts of the Metro design language.[65] Microsoft previewed Windows 8, an operating system designed to power both personal computers and tablet computers, in Taipei in June 2011.[66] A developer preview was released on September 13, and was replaced by a consumer preview on February 29, 2012.[67] On May 31, 2012, the preview version was released. On June 18, 2012, Microsoft unveiled the Surface, the first computer in the company’s history to have its hardware made by Microsoft.[68][69] On June 25, Microsoft paid US$1.2 billion to buy the social network Yammer.[70] On July 31, 2012, Microsoft launched the Outlook.com webmail service to compete with Gmail.[71] On September 4, 2012, Microsoft released Windows Server 2012.[72]\n In July 2012, Microsoft sold its 50% stake in MSNBC.com, which it had run as a joint venture with NBC since 1996.[73] On October 1, Microsoft announced its intention to launch a news operation, part of a new-look MSN, at the time of the Windows 8 launch that was later in the month.[74] On October 26, 2012, Microsoft launched Windows 8 and the Microsoft Surface.[69][75]Three days later, Windows Phone 8 was launched.[76] To cope with the potential for an increase in demand for products and services, Microsoft opened a number of “holiday stores” across the U.S. to complement the increasing number of “bricks-and-mortar” Microsoft Stores that opened in 2012.[77] On March 29, 2013, Microsoft launched a Patent Tracker.[78]\n The Kinect, a motion-sensing input device made by Microsoft and designed as a video game controller, which was first introduced in November 2010, was upgraded for the 2013 release of the eighth-generation Xbox One video game console. Kinect’s capabilities were revealed in May 2013. The new Kinect uses an ultra-wide 1080p camera, it can function in the dark due to an infrared sensor, it employs higher-end processing power and new software, it can distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movements), and the device can determine a user’s heart rate by looking at his/her face.[79] Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers as part of a plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered its biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000 after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among the investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet; with more than 11 percentage points declining Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion.[80] For the 2010 fiscal year, Microsoft had five product divisions: Windows Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division and Entertainment and Devices Division.\n     \n \n  Xbox One console\n \n \n \n    \n \n  Xbox 360 Kinect sensor\n \n \n \n      \n John W. Thompson has been appointed the chairman of Microsoft, taking over from Bill Gates.\n \n \n \n On September 3, 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy Nokia‘s mobile unit for $7 billion.[81] Also in 2013, Amy Hood became the CFO of Microsoft.[82] The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Microsoft was part of the coalition of public and private organizations that also included Facebook, Intel and Google. Led by World Wide Web inventorTim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission’s worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.[83] In line with the maturing PC business, in July 2013, Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the business into four new business divisions by function: Operating System, Apps, Cloud and Devices. All previous divisions will be diluted into new divisions without any workforce cut.[84]\n 2014–present: Windows 10, Minecraft, HoloLens     \n A depiction of a Microsoft HoloLens user navigating the shell, with an application window on the left, and theStart menu on the right\n \n \n \n Corporate affairs On February 4, 2014, Steve Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft and was succeeded by Satya Nadella, who previously led Microsoft’s Cloud and Enterprise division.[85] On the same day, John W. Thompson took on the role of chairman, with Bill Gates stepping down from the position, while continuing to participate as a technology advisor.[86]\n On April 25, 2014, Microsoft acquired Nokia Devices and Services for $7.2 billion.[87] The new subsidiary was renamed Microsoft Mobile Oy.[88] In May 2016, the company announced it will lay off 1,850 workers, taking an impairment and restructuring charge of $950 million. During the previous summer of 2015 the company wrote down $7.6 billion related to its mobile-phone business and fired 7,800 employees from those operations.[89]\n On September 15, 2014, Microsoft acquired the video game development company Mojang, best known for its wildly popular flagship game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion.[90]\n Products On January 21, 2015, Microsoft announced the release of their first Interactive whiteboard, Microsoft Surface Hub (part of the Surface family.)[91]\n On July 29, 2015, Microsoft released the next version of the Windows operating system, Windows 10.[92] Its server sibling, Windows Server 2016, was released in September 2016.\n In Q1 2015, Microsoft was the third largest maker of mobile phones selling 33 million units (7.2% of all), while a large majority (at least 75%) of them do not run any version of Windows Phone – those other phones are not categorized as smartphones by Gartner – in the same time frame 8 million Windows smartphones (2.5% of all smartphones) were made by all manufacturers (but mostly by Microsoft).[13]\n Microsoft’s share of the U.S. smartphone market in January 2016 was 2.7%.[93]\n On March 1, 2016, Microsoft announced the merger of its PC and Xbox divisions, with Phil Spencer announcing that Universal Windows Applications would be the focus for Microsoft’s gaming in the future.[94]\n Services In June 2016, Microsoft announced a project named, Microsoft Azure Information Protection. It aims to help enterprises protect their data as it moves between servers and devices.[95]\n In November 2016, Microsoft has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member during Microsoft’s Connect(); developer event in New York.[96] Price of each platinum membership is $500,000 USD per year.[97]\n Businesses     \n  This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(January 2015)    Windows Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division     \n Toronto Microsoft Store\n \n \n \n The company’s Client division produces the flagship Windows OS line such as Windows 8; it also produces the Windows Livefamily of products and services. Server and Tools produces the server versions of Windows, such as Windows Server 2008 R2 as well as a set of development tools called Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft Silverlight, a web application framework, and System Center Configuration Manager, a collection of tools providing remote-control abilities, patch management, software distribution and a hardware/software inventory. Other server products include: Microsoft SQL Server, a relational database management system, Microsoft Exchange Server, for certain business-oriented e-mail and scheduling features,Small Business Server, for messaging and other small business-oriented features; and Microsoft BizTalk Server, for business process management.\n Microsoft provides IT consulting (“Microsoft Consulting Services”) and produces a set of certification programs handled by the Server and Tools division designed to recognize individuals who have a minimal set of proficiencies in a specific role; this includes developers (“Microsoft Certified Solution Developer”), system/network analysts (“Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer”), trainers (“Microsoft Certified Trainers“) and administrators (“Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator” and “Microsoft Certified Database Administrator”). Microsoft Press, which publishes books, is also managed by the division. The Online Services Business division handles the online service MSN and the search engine Bing.\n Business Division     \n Microsoft Talo, the headquarters of Microsoft Mobile\n \n \n \n The Microsoft Business Division produces Microsoft Office including Microsoft Office 2016, the company’s line of office software. The software product includes Word (a word processor), Access (a relational database program), Excel (aspreadsheet program), Outlook (Groupware, frequently used with Exchange Server), PowerPoint (presentation software),Publisher (desktop publishing software) and Sharepoint. A number of other products were added later with the release of Office 2003 including Visio, Project, MapPoint, InfoPath and OneNote. The division also develops enterprise resource planning (ERP) software for companies under the Microsoft Dynamics brand. These include: Microsoft Dynamics AX,Microsoft Dynamics NAV, Microsoft Dynamics GP, and Microsoft Dynamics SL. They are targeted at varying company types and countries, and limited to organizations with under 7,500 employees.[98] Also included under the Dynamics brand is thecustomer relationship management software Microsoft Dynamics CRM, part of the Azure Services Platform.\n Entertainment and Devices Division See also: Microsoft Mobile \n The Entertainment and Devices Division produces the Windows CE OS for embedded systems and Windows Phone for smartphones.[99] Microsoft initially entered the mobile market through Windows CE for handheld devices, eventually developing into the Windows Mobile OS and now, Windows Phone. Windows CE is designed for devices where the OS may not directly be visible to the end user, in particular, appliances and cars. The division also produces computer games, via its in-house game publisher Microsoft Studios, that run on Windows PCs and other systems including titles such as Age of Empires, Halo and the Microsoft Flight Simulatorseries, and houses the Macintosh Business Unit which produces macOS software including Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac. Microsoft’s Entertainment and Devices Division designs, markets, and manufactures consumer electronics including the Xbox 360 game console, the handheld Zune media player, and the television-basedInternet appliance MSN TV. Microsoft also markets personal computer hardware including mice, keyboards, and various game controllers such as joysticks andgamepads.\n Future Decoded Future Decoded is a business networking event held every year by Microsoft that allows business partners of the company to share their views on what the future holds for business, society, leadership and technology.\n Corporate affairs See also: Criticism of Microsoft \n Board of Directors The company is run by a board of directors made up of mostly company outsiders, as is customary for publicly traded companies. Members of the board of directors as of January 2016 are John W. Thompson, Bill Gates, Teri L. List-Stoll, Mason Morfit, Satya Nadella, Charles Noski, Helmut Panke, Sandi Peterson, Charles W. Scharf, John W. Stanton, and Padmasree Warrior.[100] Board members are elected every year at the annual shareholders’ meeting using a majority vote system. There are five committees within the board which oversee more specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues with the company including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles financial matters such as proposing mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters including nomination of the board; and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violatingantitrust laws.[101]\n Financial     \n Five year history graph of NASDAQ: MSFT stock on July 17, 2013[102]\n \n \n \n When Microsoft went public and launched its initial public offering (IPO) in 1986, the opening stock price was $21; after the trading day, the price closed at $27.75. As of July 2010, with the company’s ninestock splits, any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; if one was to buy the IPO today given the splits and other factors, it would cost about 9 cents.[16]:235–236[103][104] The stock price peaked in 1999 at around $119 ($60.928 adjusting for splits).[105] The company began to offer a dividend on January 16, 2003, starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year, switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one-time payout of three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year.[105][106] Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts, the price of Microsoft’s stock remained steady for years.[106][107]\n Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s have both given a AAA rating to Microsoft, whose assets were valued at $41 billion as compared to only $8.5 billion in unsecured debt. Consequently, in February 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25 billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds.[108] For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft’s Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively.[109] Microsoft’s Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726 million. This follows a loss of $2.5 billion for the year 2010.[110]\n On July 20, 2012, Microsoft posted its first quarterly loss ever, despite earning record revenues for the quarter and fiscal year, with a net loss of $492 million due to awritedown related to the advertising company aQuantive, which had been acquired for $6.2 billion back in 2007.[111] As of January 2014, Microsoft’s market capitalization stood at $314B,[112] making it the 8th largest company in the world by market capitalization.[113] On November 14, 2014, Microsoft overtook Exxon Mobil to become the 2nd most valuable company by market capitalization, behind only Apple Inc. Its total market value was over $410B — with the stock price hitting $50.04 a share, the highest since early 2000.[114] In 2015, Reuters reported that Microsoft Corp had earnings abroad of $76.4 billion which were untaxed by the IRS. Under U.S. law corporations don’t pay income tax on overseas profits until the profits are brought into the United States.[115]\n Marketing     \n Microsoft Press Event at E3 Expo 2012\n \n \n \n     \n Windows 8 Launch Event in Akihabara, Tokyo on October 25, 2012\n \n \n \n In 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership (TCO) ofWindows Server 2003 to Linux; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower TCO).[116] This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products.[117] Another study, released by the Open Source Development Labs, claimed that the Microsoft studies were “simply outdated and one-sided” and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons.[118]\n As part of the “Get the Facts” campaign, Microsoft highlighted the .NET trading platform that it had developed in partnership with Accenture for the London Stock Exchange, claiming that it provided “five nines” reliability. After suffering extended downtime and unreliability[119][120] the LSE announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux-based one in 2010.[121][122]\n In 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom the New York Times called “famous for bulldozing” his political opponents[123] as Executive Vice-President, Advertising and Strategy. Penn created a series of negative ads targeting one of Microsoft’s chief competitors, Google. The ads, called “Scroogled“, attempt to make the case that Google is “screwing” consumers with search results rigged to favor Google’s paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results which favor Google products. Tech publications like Tech Crunch have been highly critical of the ad campaign,[124] while Google employees have embraced it.[125]\n Layoffs Main article: Criticism of Microsoft \n In July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft lay off ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft has laid off 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with US financial crisis.[126][127] In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle-Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brings the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts.[128] In October 2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with the elimination of 18,000 employees which was its largest ever layoff sweep.[129] In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts in the next several months.[130] In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in (Nokia) mobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of approximately $950 million, of which approximately $200 million will relate to severance payments.[131]\n United States government Main article: Criticism of Microsoft \n Microsoft provides information about reported bugs in their software to intelligence agencies of the United States government, prior to the public release of the fix. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that the corporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S. government.[132] Following media reports about PRISM, NSA’s massive electronic surveillance program, in May 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft.[133] According to leaks of said program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007.[134] However, in June 2013, an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied their participation in the program:\n We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don’t participate in it.[135]\n During the first six months in 2013, Microsoft had received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999 accounts.[136] In December 2013, the company made statement to further emphasis the fact that they take their customers’ privacy and data protection very seriously, even saying that “government snooping potentially now constitutes an “advanced persistent threat,” alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks”.[137] The statement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft’s encryption and transparency efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program they opened the first (of many) Microsoft Transparency Center, that provides “participating governments with the ability to review source code for our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no “back doors.”[138] Microsoft has also argued that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy regulations to protect consumer data.[139] In 2016, the company sued the U.S., arguing that secrecy orders were preventing the company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company’s and customers’ rights.\n Corporate identity Corporate culture     \n The Commons, located on the campus of the company’s headquarters in Redmond\n \n \n \n Technical reference for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as Microsoft Systems Journal (MSJ) are available through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.[140][141] In April 2004 Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled Channel 9, that provides a wiki and an Internet forum.[142] Another community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006.[143] Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, andCompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product. Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits.[144]\n Noted for its internal lexicon, the expression “eating our own dog food” is used to describe the policy of using pre-release and beta versions of products inside Microsoft in an effort to test them in “real-world” situations.[145] This is usually shortened to just “dog food” and is used as noun, verb, and adjective. Another bit of jargon, FYIFV or FYIV (“Fuck You, I’m [Fully] Vested”), is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish.[146] The company is also known for its hiring process, mimicked in other organizations and dubbed the “Microsoft interview“, which is notorious for off-the-wall questions such as “Why is a manhole coverround?”.[147]\n Microsoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H1B visas, which allow companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating “I’d certainly get rid of the H1B cap” in 2005.[148] Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries.[149] The Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual) employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression.[150]\n Environment In 2011, Greenpeace released a report rating the top ten big brands in cloud computing on their sources of electricity for their data centers. At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase. Phil Radford of Greenpeace said “we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today,”[151] and called on “Amazon, Microsoft and other leaders of the information-technology industry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud-based data centers.”[152] In 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers.[153] Microsoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace‘s Guide to Greener Electronics (16th Edition) that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change.[154] Microsoft’s timeline for phasing out brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and phthalates in all products is 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear. As of January 2011, it has no products that are completely free from PVC and BFRs.[155]\n Microsoft’s main U.S. campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its buildings in its Silicon Valley campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005.[156] Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit. It created one of the world’s largest private bus systems, the “Connector”, to transport people from outside the company; for on-campus transportation, the “Shuttle Connect” uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The company also subsidises regional public transport, provided by Sound Transit and King County Metro, as an incentive.[156][157] In February 2010 however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional public transport and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the State Route 520 and its floating bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.[158] Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World’s Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011.[159]\n Headquarters     \n Microsoft European HQ – Paris\n \n \n \n The corporate headquarters, informally known as the Microsoft Redmond campus, is located at One Microsoft Way in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment. It is estimated to encompass over 8 million ft2 (750,000 m2) of office space and 30,000–40,000 employees.[160] Additional offices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah (90,000 employees worldwide). The company is planning to upgrade its Mountain View, California campus on a grand scale. The company has occupied this campus since 1981. The company is planning to buy the 32-acre campus.[161] The plans submitted involve expanding the campus by 25%. It is expected that it will take three years to complete the expansion. If approved, construction will start in early 2017.[161]\n Flagship stores On October 26, 2015, the company opened its flagship retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The location features a five-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet.[162] As per company executives, Microsoft had been on the lookout for a flagship location since 2009.[163] The company’s retail locations are part of a greater strategy to help build a connection with its consumers. The opening of the store coincided with the launch of the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.[164]Notably, the second floor has a large area designated for consumers to play Xbox games. The third floor has been named the “Dell Experience at the Microsoft Store,” which showcases various Dell products. The fourth floor is for employees and administrative operations. The fifth floor has been designed as a pseudo-conference center, as it will hold events and meetings.[163] On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened a second flagship store, located in Sydney’s Pitt Street Mall.[165]The two-storey, 6000 sq ft location features Microsoft’s flagship products including the Surface line and Xbox One, there is also an Answer Desk on site for customers to get product support.[166]\n Logo Microsoft adopted the so-called “Pac-Man Logo”, designed by Scott Baker, in 1987. Baker stated “The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between theo and s to emphasize the “soft” part of the name and convey motion and speed.”[167] Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter O, nicknamed the blibbet, but it was discarded.[168] Microsoft’s logo with the tagline “Your potential. Our passion.” – below the main corporate name – is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a TV campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of “Where do you want to go today?“[169][170][171] During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company’s next tagline, “Be What’s Next.”[172] They also had a slogan/tagline “Making it all make sense.”[173]\n On August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store in Boston, indicating the company’s shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern interface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the upcoming Office Suites.[174] The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current Windows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft’s four major products: Windows (blue), Office (red), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow).[175] The logo resembles the opening of one of the commercials for Windows 95.[176][177]\n      \n \n  1975–1980\n \n \n \n    \n \n  1980–1982\n \n \n \n    \n \n  1982–1987\n \n \n \n    \n \n  1987–2012\n \n \n \n    \n \n  2012–present\n \n \n \n  \n   1975–1980: First Microsoft logo, in 1975\n  1980–1982: Second Microsoft logo, in 1980\n  1982–1987: Third Microsoft logo, in 1982\n  1987–2012: Microsoft “Pac-Man” logo, designed by Scott Baker and used from 1987 to 2012[169][170] \n  2012–present: Fifth Microsoft logo, introduced on August 23, 2012[178] \n  Sponsorship The company was the official jersey sponsor of Finland’s national basketball team at the 2015 EuroBasket.[179]\n The company sponsored the Lotus F1 Team as Microsoft Dynamics.\n See also  Bill Gates\n Paul Allen\n List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft\n     Microsoft portal \n  Xbox portal \n  Information technology portal \n  Companies portal \n  Seattle portal \n  United States portal \n  \n References    Jump up^ “Brad Smith”.

Its hardware products include theiPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, and the Apple TV digital media player. Apple’s consumer software includes the macOS and iOSoperating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suites. Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store and Mac App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud.\n Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell personal computers.[6] It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. in January 1977, and was renamed as Apple Inc. in January 2007 to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average in March 2015.[7]\n Apple is the world’s largest information technology company by revenue, the world’s largest technology company bytotal assets,[8] and the world’s second-largest mobile phone manufacturer.[9] In November 2014, in addition to being thelargest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization, Apple became the first U.S. company to be valued at over US$700 billion.[10] The company employs 115,000 permanent full-time employees as of July 2015[4] and maintains 478 retail stores in seventeen countries as of March 2016.[1] It operates the online Apple Store and iTunes Store, the latter of which is the world’s largest music retailer. There are over one billion actively used Apple products worldwide as of March 2016.[11]\n Apple’s worldwide annual revenue totaled $233 billion for the fiscal year ending in September 2015.[3] This revenue generation accounts for approximately 1.25% of the total United States GDP.[12] The company enjoys a high level ofbrand loyalty and, according to Interbrand‘s annual Best Global Brands report, has been the world’s most valuable brand for 4 years in a row,[13][14][15] with a valuation in 2016 of $178.1 billion.[16] The corporation receives significant criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors and its environmental and business practices, including the origins of source materials.\n   Contents  [hide] \n \n   1History  1.11976–84: Founding and incorporation\n 1.21984–91: Success with Macintosh\n 1.31991–97: Decline, restructuring, acquisitions\n 1.41997–2007: Return to profitability\n 1.52007–11: Success with mobile devices\n 1.62011–present: Post-Steve Jobs era; Tim Cook leadership\n  \n  2Products  2.1Mac\n 2.2iPod\n 2.3iPhone\n 2.4iPad\n 2.5Apple Watch\n 2.6Apple TV\n 2.7Software\n 2.8Electric vehicles\n 2.9Apple Energy\n  \n  3Corporate identity  3.1Logo\n 3.2Advertising\n 3.3Brand loyalty\n 3.4Home page\n 3.5Headquarters\n 3.6Stores\n  \n  4Corporate affairs  4.1Corporate culture\n 4.2Customer service\n  4.3Manufacturing  4.3.1Labor practices\n  \n  4.4Environmental practices and initiatives  4.4.1Energy and resources\n 4.4.2Toxins\n 4.4.3Green bonds\n  \n  4.5Finance  4.5.1Tax practices\n  \n 4.6Litigation\n 4.7Privacy stance\n 4.8Charitable causes\n  \n 5See also\n 6References\n 7Further reading\n 8External links\n  \n History Main article: History of Apple Inc. \n 1976–84: Founding and incorporation     \n Home of Paul and Clara Jobs, on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.Steve Jobs formed Apple Computer in its garage with Steve Wozniak andRonald Wayne in 1976.\n \n \n \n     \n The Apple I, Apple’s first product, was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case. The owner of this unit added a keyboard and a wooden case.\n \n \n \n     \n The Apple II, introduced in 1977, was a major technological advancement over its predecessor.\n \n \n \n Apple was established on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne[17][18] to sell the Apple I personal computer kit. The Apple I kits were computers single-handedly designed and hand-built by Wozniak[19][20] and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club.[21] The Apple I was sold as amotherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips), which was less than what is now considered a complete personal computer.[22] The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,777 in 2016 dollars, adjusted for inflation).[23][24][25][26][27][28]\n Apple was incorporated January 3, 1977,[29] without Wayne, who sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800.[18] Multimillionaire Mike Markkulaprovided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of Apple.[30][31] During the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980 yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118m, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[32]\n The Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire. It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5 1/4 inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II.[33] The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first “killer app” of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program.[34] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office.[34] Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy.[35][36]\n By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The company introduced the Apple III in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with IBM and Microsoft in the business and corporate computing market.[37] Jobs and several Apple employees, including Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in December 1979 to see the Xerox Alto. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares (800,000 split-adjusted shares) of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[38]\n Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface (GUI), and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa.[39] In 1982, however, he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting. Jobs took over Jef Raskin’s low-cost-computer project, the Macintosh. A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.[40]\n On December 12, 1980, Apple went public at $22 per share,[41] generating more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956 and instantly creating more millionaires (about 300) than any company in history.[42]\n 1984–91: Success with Macintosh See also: Timeline of Macintosh models \n     \n The first Macintosh, released in 1984, was the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse.\n \n \n \n In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language at all.[43] Its debut was signified by “1984”, a $1.5 million television commercial directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[44] The commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for Apple’s success[45] and a “masterpiece”.[46][47]\n The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sales were not strong[48] due to its high price and limited range of software titles. The machine’s fortunes changed with the introduction of the LaserWriter, the first PostScript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price, and PageMaker, an early desktop publishing package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[49] The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.\n In 1985, a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired two years earlier.[50] The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to “contain” Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley’s direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which Apple’s board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.[48] Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT Inc. the same year.[51]\n     \n The Macintosh Portable, released in 1989, was Apple’s first battery-powered portable Macintosh personal computer.\n \n \n \n After Jobs’ departure, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called “high-right policy” named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales aspower users snapped up every increase in power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to Jean-Louis Gassée‘s mantra of “fifty-five or die”, referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.[52]\n This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on PC clonesthat offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market, and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company’s history that saw declining sales, and led to a 20% drop in Apple’s stock price.[53] Gassée’s objections were overruled, and he was forced from the company in 1990. Later that year, Apple introduced three lower cost models, the Macintosh Classic, Macintosh LC and Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand.\n In 1991, Apple introduced the PowerBook, replacing the “luggable” Macintosh Portable with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for the Classic Mac OS. The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.[50] For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the “first golden age” of the Macintosh.[citation needed]\n Apple believed the Apple II series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the low-end Macintosh.[54] In 1990, Apple released the Macintosh LC, which featured a single expansion slot for the Apple IIe Card to help migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform;[54] the Apple IIe was discontinued in 1993.\n 1991–97: Decline, restructuring, acquisitions See also: Timeline of the Apple II family \n     \n The Penlite was Apple’s first attempt at a tablet computer. Created in 1992, the project was designed to bring the Mac OS to a tablet – but was shelved in favor of the Newton.[55]\n \n \n \n The success of Apple’s lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets. These were the high-end Quadra, the mid-range Centris line, and the ill-fated Performaseries. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.[56]\n Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including digital cameras, portable CD audio players, speakers, video consoles, the eWorld online service, and TV appliances. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued Newton division based on John Sculley’s unrealistic market forecasts.[citation needed] Ultimately, none of these products helped and Apple’s market share and stock prices continued to slide.[citation needed]\n Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.[57] Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the Apple Lisa in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp..[58] The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed. At this time, a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied Apple’s reputation, and Sculley was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler.[59]\n     \n The Newton was Apple’s first foray into the PDA markets, as well as one of the first in the industry. Despite being a financial flop at the time of its release, it helped pave the way for the PalmPilotand Apple’s own iPhone and iPad in the future.\n \n \n \n By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as A/UX. The Macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from OS/2 and UNIX vendors such as Sun Microsystems. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.[60]\n In 1994, Apple allied with IBM and Motorola in the AIM alliance with the goal of creating a new computing platform (thePowerPC Reference Platform), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP’s performance and Apple’s software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh, the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola’s PowerPC processor.[61]\n In 1996, Spindler was replaced by Gil Amelio as CEO. Amelio made numerous changes at Apple, including extensive layoffs and cut costs.[62] After numerous failed attempts to improve Mac OS, first with the Taligent project and later with Copland andGershwin, Amelio chose to purchase NeXT and its NeXTSTEP operating system and bring Steve Jobs back to Apple.[63]\n 1997–2007: Return to profitability    \n \n  \n \n \n  Power Mac was a line of Apple Macintoshworkstation-class personal computers based on various models of PowerPCmicroprocessors that were developed from 1994 to 2006.\n \n \n The NeXT deal was finalized on February 9, 1997,[64] bringing Jobs back to Apple as an advisor. On July 9, 1997, Amelio was ousted by the board of directors after overseeing a three-year record-low stock price and crippling financial losses. Jobs acted as the interim CEO and began restructuring the company’s product line; it was during this period that he identified the design talent of Jonathan Ive, and the pair worked collaboratively to rebuild Apple’s status.[65]\n At the 1997 Macworld Expo, Jobs announced that Apple would join Microsoft to release new versions of Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, and that Microsoft had made a $150 million investment in non-voting Apple stock.[66] On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the Apple Online Store, which was tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy.[67][68]\n On August 15, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the Macintosh 128K: the iMac. The iMac design team was led by Ive, who would later design the iPod and the iPhone.[69][70] The iMac featured modern technology and a unique design, and sold almost 800,000 units in its first five months.[71][dead link]\n During this period,[when?] Apple completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital production software for both professionals and consumers. In 1998, Apple purchased Macromedia‘s Key Grip software project, signaling an expansion into the digital video editing market. The sale was an outcome of Macromedia’s decision to solely focus upon web development software. The product, still unfinished at the time of the sale, was renamed “Final Cut Pro” when it was launched on the retail market in April 1999.[72][73] The development of Key Grip also led to Apple’s release of the consumer video-editing product iMovie in October 1999.[74] Next, Apple successfully acquired the German company Astarte, which had developed DVD authoring technology, as well as Astarte’s corresponding products and engineering team in April 2000. Astarte’s digital tool DVDirector was subsequently transformed into the professional-oriented DVD Studio Pro software product. Apple then employed the same technology to create iDVD for the consumer market.[74] In 2002, Apple purchased Nothing Real for their advanced digital compositingapplication Shake,[75] as well as Emagic for the music productivity application Logic. The purchase of Emagic made Apple the first computer manufacturer to own a music software company. The acquisition was followed by the development of Apple’s consumer-level GarageBand application.[76] The release of iPhoto in the same year completed the iLife suite.[77]\n Mac OS X, based on NeXT’s OPENSTEP and BSD Unix, was released on March 24, 2001 after several years of development. Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Mac OS X aimed to combine the stability, reliability and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface. To aid users in migrating from Mac OS 9, the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 applications within Mac OS X via the Classic Environment.[78]\n On May 19, 2001, Apple opened the first official Apple Retail Stores in Virginia and California.[79] On October 23 of the same year, Apple debuted the iPod portable digital audio player. The product, which was first sold on November 10, 2001, was phenomenally successful with over 100 million units sold within six years.[80][81] In 2003, Apple’s iTunes Store was introduced. The service offered online music downloads for $0.99 a song and integration with the iPod. The iTunes store quickly became the market leader in online music services, with over 5 billion downloads by June 19, 2008.[82]\n Main article: Apple’s transition to Intel processors \n     \n The MacBook Pro, Apple’s first laptop with an Intel microprocessor, introduced in 2006.\n \n \n \n At the Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address on June 6, 2005, Jobs announced that Apple would begin producing Intel-based Mac computers in 2006.[83] On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac became the first Apple computers to use Intel’s Core Duo CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel chips for the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced.[83] The Power Mac, iBook and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors.[84][85] On April 29, 2009, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips.[86] Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.[87]\n Apple’s success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple’s stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80. In January 2006, Apple’s market capsurpassed that of Dell.[88] Nine years prior, Dell’s CEO Michael Dell had said that if he ran Apple he would “shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.”[89] Although Apple’s market share in computers had grown, it remained far behind competitors using Microsoft Windows, accounting for about 8% of desktops and laptops in the US.[citation needed]\n Since 2001, Apple’s design team has progressively abandoned the use of translucent colored plastics first used in the iMac G3. This design change began with thetitanium-made PowerBook and was followed by the iBook‘s white polycarbonate structure and the flat-panel iMac.[90][91]\n 2007–11: Success with mobile devices     \n A fifth generation iPod, one ofJonathan Ive‘s most recognized industrial designs. iPod has been phenomenally successful with over 390 million units sold worldwide.[92]\n \n \n \n During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would thereafter be known as “Apple Inc.”, because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[93][94] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone and the Apple TV.[95][96][97][98] The following day, Apple shares hit $97.80, an all-time high at that point. In May, Apple’s share price passed the $100 mark.[99] Apple would achieve widespread success with its iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad products, which introduced innovations in mobile phones, portable music players and personal computers respectively.[100] Furthermore, by early 2007, 800,000 Final Cut Pro users were registered.[101]\n In an article posted on Apple’s website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players, if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[102] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI’s catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[103] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce the corresponding changes to the iTunes Store.[104]\n In July 2008, Apple launched the App Store to sell third-party applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch.[105] Within a month, the store sold 60 million applications and registered an average daily revenue of $1 million, with Jobs speculating in August 2008 that the App Store could become a billion-dollar business for Apple.[106] By October 2008, Apple was the third-largest mobile handset supplier in the world due to the popularity of the iPhone.[107]\n On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that 2009 would be the last year the corporation would attend the Macworld Expo, after more than 20 years of attendance, and that senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing Philip Schiller would deliver the 2009 keynote address in lieu of the expected Jobs. The official press release explained that Apple was “scaling back” on trade shows in general, including Macworld Tokyo and the Apple Expo in Paris, France, primarily because the enormous successes of the Apple Retail Stores and website had rendered trade shows a minor promotional channel.[108][109]\n On January 14, 2009, an internal memo from Jobs announced that he would be taking a six-month medical leave of absence from Apple until the end of June 2009 and would spend the time focusing on his health. In the email, Jobs stated that “the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well”, and explained that the break would allow the company “to focus on delivering extraordinary products”.[110] Despite Jobs’s absence, Apple recorded its best non-holiday quarter (Q1 FY 2009) during the recession with revenue of $8.16 billion and profit of $1.21 billion.[111][112]\n     Wikinews has related news:  Apple unveils iPhone 4, iOS 4 at Worldwide Developers Conference 2010\n Apple to give free cases, refunds to iPhone 4 owners\n Apple unveils new iPods, Apple TV; updates iOS, iTunes\n Apple unveils new MacBook Air laptops, iLife ’11 software suite\n      After years of speculation and multiple rumored “leaks”, Apple announced a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and many iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, despite very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.[113] In May of the same year, Apple’s market cap exceeded that of competitorMicrosoft for the first time since 1989.[114]\n In June 2010, Apple released the iPhone 4,[115] which introduced video calling, multitasking, and a new uninsulated stainless steel design that acted as the phone’s antenna. Later that year, Apple again refreshed its iPod line of MP3 players by introducing a multi-touch iPod Nano, an iPod Touch with FaceTime, and an iPod Shuffle that brought back the buttons of earlier generations.[116][117][118] Additionally, on October 20, Apple updated the MacBook Air laptop, iLife suite of applications, and unveiled Mac OS X Lion, the last version with the name Mac OS X.[119]\n In October 2010, Apple shares hit an all-time high, eclipsing $300.[120]\n     \n Apple Store in Yonkers, New York\n \n \n \n On January 6, 2011, the company opened its Mac App Store, a digital software distribution platform similar to the iOS App Store.[121]\n Alongside peer entities such as Atari and Cisco Systems, Apple was featured in the documentary Something Ventured which premiered in 2011 and explored the three-decade era that led to the establishment and dominance of Silicon Valley.[122]\n On January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence, for an indefinite period, to allow him to focus on his health. Chief operating officer Tim Cook assumed Jobs’s day-to-day operations at Apple, although Jobs would still remain “involved in major strategic decisions”.[123] Apple became the most valuable consumer-facing brand in the world.[124] In June 2011, Jobs surprisingly took the stage and unveiled iCloud, an online storage and syncing service for music, photos, files and software which replaced MobileMe, Apple’s previous attempt at content syncing.[125]\n This would be the last product launch Jobs would attend before his death. It has been argued that Apple has achieved such efficiency in its supply chain that the company operates as a monopsony (one buyer, many sellers) and can dictate terms to its suppliers.[126][127][128] In July 2011, due to the American debt-ceiling crisis, Apple’s financial reserves were briefly larger than those of the U.S. Government.[129]\n On August 24, 2011, Jobs resigned his position as CEO of Apple.[130][dead link] He was replaced by Cook and Jobs became Apple’s chairman. Prior to this, Apple did not have a chairman and instead had two co-lead directors, Andrea Jung and Arthur D. Levinson, who continued with those titles until Levinson became Chairman of the Board in November.[131]\n 2011–present: Post-Steve Jobs era; Tim Cook leadership On October 5, 2011, Apple announced that Steve Jobs had died, marking the end of an era for Apple.[132][133] The first major product announcement by Apple following Jobs’s passing occurred on January 19, 2012, when Apple’s Phil Schiller introduced iBooks Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City.[134] Jobs had stated in his biography that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education.\n From 2011 to 2012, Apple released the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, which featured improved cameras, an “intelligent software assistant” named Siri, and cloud-sourced data with iCloud;[135][136][137] the third and fourth generation iPads, which featured Retina displays;[138][139][140] and the iPad Mini, which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad’s 9.7-inch screen.[141] These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple’s biggest iPhone launch with over 2 million pre-orders[142] and sales of 3 million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth generation iPad (released November 3, 2012).[143] Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers.[140][141][144]\n On October 29, 2011, Apple purchased C3 Technologies, a mapping company, for $240 million, making it the third mapping company that Apple has purchased.[145]On January 10, 2012, Apple paid $500 million to acquire Anobit, an Israeli hardware company that developed and supplied a proprietary memory signal processing technology that improved the performance of the flash-memory used in iPhones and iPads.[146][147] On July 24, 2012, during a conference call with investors, Tim Cook said that he loved India, but that Apple was going to expect larger opportunities outside of India. Cook cited the 30% sourcing requirement from India as the reason.[clarification needed][148][149][150][151]\n On August 20, 2012, Apple’s rising stock rose the company’s value to a world-record $624 billion. This beat the non-inflation-adjusted record for market capitalization set by Microsoft in 1999.[152] On August 24, 2012, a US jury ruled that Samsung should pay Apple $1.05 billion (£665m) in damages in an intellectual propertylawsuit.[153] Samsung appealed the damages award, which the Court reduced by $450 million.[154] The Court further granted Samsung’s request for a new trial.[154]On November 10, 2012, Apple confirmed a global settlement that would dismiss all lawsuits between Apple and HTC up to that date, in favor of a ten-year license agreement for current and future patents between the two companies.[155] It is predicted that Apple will make $280 million a year from this deal with HTC.[156]\n See also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple \n A previously confidential email written by Jobs a year before his death, was presented during the proceedings of the Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. lawsuits and became publicly available in early April 2014. With a subject line that reads “Top 100 – A,” the email was sent only to the company’s 100 most senior employees and outlines Jobs’s vision of Apple Inc.’s future under 10 subheadings. Notably, Jobs declares a “Holy War with Google” for 2011 and schedules a “new campus” for 2015.[157]\n In March 2013, Apple filed a patent for an augmented reality (AR) system that can identify objects in a live video stream and present information corresponding to these objects through a computer-generated information layer overlaid on top of the real-world image.[158] Later in 2013, Apple acquired Embark Inc., a small Silicon Valley-based mapping company that builds free transit apps to help smartphone users navigate public transportation in U.S. cities,[159] and PrimeSense, an Israeli 3D sensing company based in Tel Aviv.[160] In December 2013, Apple Inc. purchased social analytics firm Topsy. Topsy is one of a small number of firms with real-time access to the messages that appear on Twitter and can “do real-time analysis of the trends and discussions happening on Twitter”.[161] The company also made several high-profile hiring decisions in 2013. On July 2, 2013, Apple recruited Paul Deneve, Belgian President and CEO of Yves Saint Laurent as a vice president reporting directly to Tim Cook.[162] A mid-October 2013 announcement revealed that Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts will commence as a senior vice president at Apple in mid-2014. Ahrendts oversaw Burberry’s digital strategy for almost eight years and, during her tenure, sales increased to about US$3.2 billion and shares gained more than threefold.[163]\n At the Worldwide Developer’s Conference on June 10, 2013, Apple announced the seventh iOS operating system alongside OS X Mavericks, the tenth version of OS X, and a new Internet radio service called iTunes Radio.[164][165][166] iTunes Radio, iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks were released fall 2013.[164][165][167] On December 6, 2013, Apple Inc. launched iBeacon across its 254 U.S. retail stores. Using Bluetooth wireless technology, iBeacon senses the user’s exact location within the Apple store and sends the user messages about products, events and other information, tailored to the user’s location.[168]\n Alongside Google vice-president Vint Cerf and AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson, Cook attended a closed-door summit held by President Obama on August 8, 2013, in regard to government surveillance and the Internet in the wake of the Edward Snowden NSA incident.[169][170] On February 4, 2014, Cook met with Abdullah Gül, the President of Turkey, in Ankara to discuss the company’s involvement in the Fatih project.[171] Cook also confirmed that Turkey‘s first Apple Retail Store would be opened in Istanbul in April 2014.[172]\n An anonymous Apple employee revealed to the Bloomberg media publication that the opening of a Tokyo, Japan, store was planned for 2014. A Japanese analyst has stated, “For Apple, the Japanese market is appealing in terms of quantity and price. There is room to expand tablet sales and a possibility the Japanese market expands if Apple’s mobile carrier partners increase.”[173] As of June 13, 2014, Apple operated three stores in Tokyo.[174] On October 1, 2013, Apple India executives unveiled a plan to expand further into the Indian market, following Cook’s acknowledgment of the country in July 2013 when sales results showed that iPhone sales in India grew 400% during the second quarter of 2013.[175]\n Apple Inc. reported that the company sold 51 million iPhones in the Q1 of 2014 (an all-time quarterly record), compared to 47.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Apple also sold 26 million iPads during the quarter, also an all-time quarterly record, compared to 22.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 4.8 million Macs, compared to 4.1 million in the year-ago quarter.[176] On May 28, 2014, Apple confirmed its intent to acquire Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine‘s audio company Beats Electronics—producer of the Beats by Dr. Dre line of headphones and speaker products, and operator of the music streaming service Beats Music—for $3 billion, and to sell their products through Apple’s retail outlets and resellers. Iovine felt that Beats had always “belonged” with Apple, as the company modeled itself after Apple’s “unmatched ability to marry culture and technology.”[177][178][179] In August 2014, an Apple representative confirmed to the media that Anand Lal Shimpi, editor and publisher of the AnandTech website, had been recruited by Apple without elaborating on Lal Shimpi’s role.[180]\n Apple has been at the top of Interbrand‘s annual Best Global Brands report for 4 years in a row; 2013,[13] 2014,[14] 2015,[15] and 2016, with a valuation of $178.1 billion.[16]\n In December 2015, Apple bought a 70,000 square foot wafer fab building in San Jose, CA from Maxim Integrated for $18.2 million.[181]\n In 2016, it was revealed that Apple would be making its first original scripted series,[182] a six-episode drama about the life of Dr. Dre. Music Video director Paul Hunter will direct the series.[182]\n On May 12, 2016, Apple Inc., invested $1 billion USD in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese competitor to Uber.[183][184][185] The Information reported in October 2016 that Apple had taken a board seat in Didi Chuxing,[186] a move that James Vincent of The Verge speculated could be a strategic company decision by Apple to get closer to the automobile industry,[187] particularly Didi Chuxing’s reported interest in self-driving cars.[188]\n On June 6, 2016, Forbes released their list of companies ranked on revenue generation. In the trailing fiscal year, Apple appeared on the list as the top tech company.[189] It ranked third, overall, with $233 billion in revenue.[189] This represents a movement upward of two spots from the previous year’s list.[189]\n On September 22, 2016, Apple Inc. acquired Tuplejump, an India/US-based machine learning company.[190]\n Products See also: Timeline of Apple Inc. products and List of products discontinued by Apple Inc. \n Mac Main article: Macintosh \n See also: Timeline of Macintosh models, List of Macintosh models grouped by CPU type, and List of Macintosh models by case type \n Macs that are currently being sold are:\n   MacBook: Consumer ultra-thin, ultra-portable notebook, introduced in 2006 and relaunched in 2015.\n  MacBook Air: Consumer ultra-thin, ultra-portable notebook, introduced in 2008.\n  MacBook Pro: Professional notebook, introduced in 2006.\n  Mac Mini: Consumer sub-desktop computer, introduced in 2005.\n  iMac: Consumer all-in one desktop computer, introduced in 1998.\n  Mac Pro: Workstation desktop computer, introduced in 2006.\n  Apple sells a variety of computer accessories for Macs, including Thunderbolt Display, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, Magic Keyboard, the AirPort wireless networking products, and Time Capsule.\n iPod Main article: iPod \n     \n iPod line as of 2014.

The current generation features the Apple A8 processor, a Retina display, Siri and dual cameras on the front (1.2 megapixel sensor) and back (8 megapixel iSight). The latter camera supports HD video recording at 1080p and slow motion video at 120fps in 720p.[192] \n  iPhone Main article: iPhone \n     \n The first-generation iPhone, 3G, 4, 5, 5C and5S to scale.\n \n \n \n At the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo in January 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the long-anticipated[193] iPhone, a convergence of an Internet-enabled smartphone and iPod.[194] The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007 for $499 (4 GB) and $599 (8 GB) with an AT&amp;T contract.[195] On February 5, 2008, it was updated to have 16 GB of memory, in addition to the 8 GB and 4 GB models.[196] It combined a 2.5G quad band GSM and EDGE cellular phone with features found in handheld devices, running scaled-down versions of Apple’s Mac OS X (dubbed iPhone OS, later renamed iOS), with various Mac OS X applications such as Safari andMail. It also includes web-based and Dashboard apps such as Google Maps and Weather. The iPhone features a 3.5-inch (89 mm) touchscreen display, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi (both “b” and “g”).[194]\n A second version, the iPhone 3G, was released on July 11, 2008 with a reduced price of $199 for the 8 GB version and $299 for the 16 GB version.[197] This version added support for 3G networking and assisted-GPS navigation. The flat silver back and large antenna square of the original model were eliminated in favor of a glossy, curved black or white back. Software capabilities were improved with the release of the App Store, which provided iPhone-compatible applications to download. On April 24, 2009, the App Store[198]surpassed one billion downloads.[199] On June 8, 2009, Apple announced the iPhone 3GS. It provided an incremental update to the device, including faster internal components, support for faster 3G speeds, video recording capability, and voice control.\n At the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 7, 2010, Apple announced the redesigned iPhone 4.[200] It featured a 960×640 display, the Apple A4 processor, a gyroscope for enhanced gaming, a 5MP camera with LED flash, front-facing VGA camera and FaceTime video calling. Shortly after its release, reception issues were discovered by consumers, due to the stainless steel band around the edge of the device, which also serves as the phone’s cellular signal and Wi-Fi antenna. The issue was corrected by a “Bumper Case” distributed by Apple for free to all owners for a few months. In June 2011, Apple overtook Nokia to become the world’s biggest smartphone maker by volume.[201] On October 4, 2011, Apple unveiled the iPhone 4S, which was first released on October 14, 2011.[202] It features the Apple A5 processor and Siri voice assistant technology, the latter of which Apple had acquired in 2010.[203] It also features an updated 8MP camera with new optics. Apple began a new accessibility feature, Made for iPhone Hearing Aids with the iPhone 4S.[204] Made for iPhone Hearing Aids feature Live Listen, it can help you hear a conversation in a noisy room or hear someone speaking across the room.[205] Apple sold 4 million iPhone 4S phones in the first three days of availability.[206]\n On September 12, 2012, Apple introduced the iPhone 5.[207] It has a 4-inch display, 4G LTE connectivity, and the upgraded Apple A6 chip, among several other improvements.[208] Two million iPhones were sold in the first twenty-four hours of pre-ordering[209] and over five million handsets were sold in the first three days of its launch.[210] Upon the launch of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C, Apple set a new record for first-weekend smartphone sales by selling over nine million devices in the first three days of its launch.[211] The release of the iPhone 5S and 5C was the first time that Apple simultaneously launched two models.[212]\n A patent filed in July 2013 revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user’s habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iPhone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.[213]\n In a March 2014 interview, Apple designer Jonathan Ive used the iPhone as an example of Apple’s ethos of creating high-quality, life-changing products. He explained that the phones are comparatively expensive due to the intensive effort that is used to make them:\n We don’t take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons … Quite the reverse. The body is made from a single piece of machined aluminium … The whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured, except for the Apple logo. The chamfers [smoothed-off edges] are cut with diamond-tipped cutters. The cutters don’t usually last very long, so we had to figure out a way of mass-manufacturing long-lasting ones. The camera cover is sapphire crystal. Look at the details around the sim-card slot. It’s extraordinary![65]\n On September 9, 2014, Apple introduced the iPhone 6, alongside the iPhone 6 Plus that both have screen sizes over 4-inches.[214] One year later, Apple introduced the iPhone 6S, and iPhone 6S Plus, which introduced a new technology called 3D Touch, including an increase of the rear camera to 12 MP, and the FaceTime camera to 5 MP.[215] On March 21, 2016, Apple introduced the iPhone SE that has a 4-inch size last used with the 5S and has the same internal hardware as the 6S.[216]\n     \n IPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were introduced on September 7, 2016\n \n \n \n On September 7, 2016, Apple introduced the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, which feature improved system and graphics performance, add water resistance, a new rear dual-camera system on the 7 Plus model, and, controversially, remove the 3.5 mm headphone jack.[217][218]\n iPad Main article: iPad \n     \n iPad Air 2 in Gold\n \n \n \n On January 27, 2010, Apple introduced their much-anticipated media tablet, the iPad, which runs a modified version of iOS. It offers multi-touch interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers, e-books, photos, videos, music, word processing documents, video games, and most existing iPhone apps using a 9.7-inch screen.[219] It also includes a mobile version ofSafari for web browsing, as well as access to the App Store, iTunes Library, iBookstore, Contacts, and Notes. Content is downloadable via Wi-Fi and optional 3G service or synced through the user’s computer.[220] AT&amp;T was initially the sole U.S. provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.[221]\n On March 2, 2011, Apple introduced the iPad 2, which had a faster processor and a camera on the front and back. It also added support for optional 3G service provided by Verizon in addition to AT&amp;T.[222] The availability of the iPad 2 was initially limited as a result of a devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011.[223]\n The third-generation iPad was released on March 7, 2012 and marketed as “the new iPad“. It added LTE service from AT&amp;T or Verizon, an upgraded A5X processor, and Retina display. The dimensions and form factor remained relatively unchanged, with the new iPad being a fraction thicker and heavier than the previous version and featuring minor positioning changes.[224]\n On October 23, 2012, Apple’s fourth-generation iPad came out, marketed as the “iPad with Retina display“. It added the upgraded A6X processor and replaced the traditional 30-pin dock connector with the all-digital Lightning connector.[225] TheiPad Mini was also introduced. It featured a reduced 7.9-inch display and much of the same internal specifications as the iPad 2.[226]\n On October 22, 2013, Apple introduced the iPad Air and the iPad Mini with Retina Display, both featuring a new 64-bit Apple A7 processor.[227]\n The iPad Air 2 was unveiled on October 16, 2014. It added better graphics and central processing and a camera burst mode as well as minor updates. The iPad Mini 3 was unveiled at the same time.[227]\n Since its launch, iPad users have downloaded over three billion apps. The total number of App Store downloads, as of June 2015, is over 100 billion.[228]\n On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the iPad Pro, an iPad with a 12.9-inch display that supports two new accessories, the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil.[229] A 9.7-inch iPad Pro was announced on March 21, 2016.[230]\n Apple Watch Main article: Apple Watch \n     \n The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device, with the shipment of 11.4 million smart watches in the first half of 2015, according to analyst firm Canalys.[231]\n \n \n \n The Apple Watch smartwatch was launched by Cook on September 9, 2014, and released on April 24, 2015.[232] The wearable device consists of fitness-tracking capabilities that are similar to Fitbit, and must be used in combination with an iPhone to work (only the iPhone 5, or later models, are compatible with the Apple Watch).[233][234][235]\n The second generation of Apple Watch, Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Series 1 were released in September 2016.[236]\n Apple TV Main article: Apple TV \n At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the Apple TV (previously known as the iTV),[237] a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user’s TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer’s iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40 GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for HDMI and component video, and played video at a maximum resolution of 720p.[238] On May 31, 2007, a 160 GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40 GB model.[239] A software update released on January 15, 2008 allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.[240]\n In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of flash memory to cache media downloaded. Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor. The memory included in the device is half of that in the iPhone 4 at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation iPod Touch.[241]\n It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including YouTube and Netflix, and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.\n At the September 9, 2015 event, Apple unveiled an overhauled Apple TV, which now runs a variant of OS X, tvOS, and contains 32GB or 64 GB of NAND Flash to store games, programs, and to cache the current media playing. The release also coincided with the opening of a separate Apple TV App Store and a new Siri Remote with a glass touchpad, gyroscope and microphone.\n Software See also: List of Macintosh software \n     \n Apple Worldwide Developers Conference is held annually by Apple to showcase its new software and technologies for software developers.\n \n \n \n Apple develops its own operating system to run on Macs, macOS, the latest version being macOS Sierra (version 10.12). Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its macOS operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundlesiMovie, iPhoto and GarageBand. For presentation, page layout and word processing, iWork is available, which includesKeynote, Pages, and Numbers. iTunes, QuickTime media player, and Software Update are available as free downloads for both macOS and Windows.\n Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the operating system macOS Server; Apple Remote Desktop, a remote systems management application; and Xsan, a Storage Area Network file system. For the professional creative market, there is Final Cut Pro, a video production suite; Logic Pro, a comprehensive music toolkit; and Motion, an advanced effects composition program.\n Apple also offers online services with iCloud, which provides cloud storage and syncing for a wide range of data, including email, contacts, calendars, photos and documents. It also offers iOS device backup, and is able to integrate directly with third-party apps for even greater functionality. iCloud is the fourth generation of online services provided by Apple, and was preceded by MobileMe, .Mac and iTools, all which met varying degrees of success.\n Electric vehicles Main article: Apple electric car project \n According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Apple wants to start producing an electric car with autonomous driving as soon as 2020. Apple has made efforts to recruit battery development engineers and other electric automobile engineers from A123 Systems, LG Chem, Samsung Electronics, Panasonic, Toshiba, Johnson Controlsand Tesla Motors.[242]\n Apple Energy Apple Energy, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple Inc. that sells solar energy. As of June 6, 2016, Apple’s solar farms in California and Nevada have been declared to provide 217.9 megawatts of solar generation capacity.[243][244] In addition to the company’s solar energy production, Apple has received regulatory approval to construct a landfill gas energy plant in North Carolina. Apple will use the methane emissions to generate electricity.[245] Apple’s North Carolina data center is already powered entirely with energy from renewable sources.[246]\n Corporate identity Logo See also: Typography of Apple Inc. \n “Apple logo” redirects here. For the programming language, see Apple Logo.\n    \n First Apple logo (April 1, 1976, Prototype)\n \n  \n First official Apple logo used from April 1977[247] to 1998.\n \n  \n Current Apple logo since 1998.[248][not in citation given] \n \n \n \n According to Steve Jobs, the company’s name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name “Apple” was “fun, spirited and not intimidating”.[249]\n Apple’s first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff‘s “rainbow Apple”, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the “bitten” logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. However, Jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company.[250][251] The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.[252] The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.[252] This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.[253][254] Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.[252][255]\n On August 27, 1999[248] (the year following the introduction of the iMac G3), Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation. An Aqua-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 1999 to 2003, and a glass-themed version was used from 2007 to 2013.[256]\n Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were Beatles fans,[257][258] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1967. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in 2007.[259]\n Advertising Main article: Apple Inc. advertising \n Apple’s first slogan, “Byte into an Apple”, was coined in the late 1970s.[260] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan “Think Different” was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.[261] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines — for example, “iThink, therefore iMac” was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,[262] and “Say hello to iPhone” has been used in iPhone advertisements.[263] “Hello” was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac (“hello (again)”), and iPod.[264]\n From the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the 1984 Super Bowl commercial to the more modern ‘Get a Mac‘ adverts, Apple has been recognized in for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns were criticized, particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.[265][266][267] Apple’s product commercials gained a lot of attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.[268] Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple commercials include Canadian singer Feist with the song “1234” and Yael Naïm with the song “New Soul“.[268]\n Brand loyalty     \n Apple aficionados wait in line around the Apple Store in anticipation of a new product.\n \n \n \n    “The scenes I witnessed at the opening of the new Apple store in London’s Covent Garden were more like an evangelical prayer meeting than a chance to buy a phone or a laptop.”\n \n \n —Alex Riley, writing for the BBC[269]\n \n Apple’s high level of brand loyalty is considered[by whom?] unusual for any product. Apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism “something that was stumbled upon,”[270] while Ive explained in 2014 that “People have an incredibly personal relationship” with Apple’s products.[65] Apple Store openings can draw crowds of thousands, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event.[271] The opening ofNew York City‘s Fifth Avenue “Cube” store had a line half a mile long; a few Mac fans used the setting to propose marriage.[272] The line for the Ginza opening in Tokyo was estimated to include thousands of people and exceeded eight city blocks.[273] The high level of brand loyalty has been criticized and ridiculed, applying the epithet “Apple fanboy” and mocking the lengthy lines before a product launch.[274] An internal memo leaked in 2015 suggested the company planned to discourage long lines and direct customers to purchase its products on its website.[275]\n Fortune magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.[276][277][278][279][280] On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world’s most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group‘s “Best Global Brands” report.[281] Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the world’s most innovative brand every year since 2005.[282]\n John Sculley told The Guardian newspaper in 1997: “People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company. It was the marketing company of the decade.”[283] Research in 2002 by NetRatings indicate that the average Apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other PC company consumers. The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average Apple Inc. products were more expensive than other PC products.[284][285]\n In response to a query about the devotion of loyal Apple consumers, Jonathan Ive responded:\n What people are responding to is much bigger than the object. They are responding to something rare—a group of people who do more than simply make something work, they make the very best products they possibly can. It’s a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness.[65]\n Home page The Apple website home page has been used to commemorate, or pay tribute to, milestones and events outside of Apple’s product offerings:\n  2016: Muhammad Ali[286] \n 2016: Bill Campbell (board member and friend)[287] \n 2016: Martin Luther King, Jr.[288] \n 2014: Robin Williams[289] \n 2013: Nelson Mandela[290] \n 2011: Steve Jobs[291] \n 2010: Jerome B.

This Apple campus has six buildings that total 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2) and was built in 1993 by Sobrato Development Cos.[297]\n Apple has a satellite campus in neighboring Sunnyvale, California, where it houses a testing and research laboratory.[298] AppleInsider published article in March 2014 claiming that Apple has a tucked away a top-secret facility where is developing the SG5 electric vehicle project codenamed “Titan” under the shell company name SixtyEight Research.[299]\n In 2006, Apple announced its intention to build a second campus in Cupertino about 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the current campus and next to Interstate 280.[300] The new campus building will be designed by Norman Foster.[301] The Cupertino City Council approved the proposed “spaceship” design campus on October 15, 2013, after a 2011 presentation by Jobs detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs. The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central, four-storied, circular building surrounded by extensive landscape. It will feature a café with room for 3,000 sitting people and parking underground as well as in a parking structure. The 2.8 million square foot facility will also include Jobs’s original designs for a fitness center and a corporate auditorium.[302]\n Apple’s headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland.[303][304][305][306][307][308][309] The facility, which opened in 1980, was Apple’s first location outside of the United States.[310] Apple Sales International, which deals with all of Apple’s international sales outside of the USA, is located at Apple’s campus in Cork[311] along with Apple Distribution International, which similarly deals with Apple’s international distribution network.[312] On April 20, 2012, Apple added 500 new jobs at its European headquarters, increasing the total workforce from around 2,800 to 3,300 employees.[302][304][313] The company will build a new office block on its Hollyhill Campus to accommodate the additional staff.[314] Its United Kingdom headquarters is at Stockley Park on the outskirts ofLondon.[315]\n In February 2015, Apple opened their new 180,000-square-foot headquarters in Herzliya, Israel, which will accommodate approximately 800 employees. This opening was Apple’s third office located within Israel; the first, also in Herzliya, was obtained as part of the Anobit acquisition, and the other is a research center inHaifa.[316][317]\n Stores Apple has 478 retail stores (as of March 2016) in seventeen countries[1] and an online store available in 39 countries.[318] Each store is designed to suit the needs of the location and regulatory authorities. Apple has received numerous architectural awards for its store designs, particularly its midtown Manhattan location on Fifth Avenue.[319][320]\n The Apple Store in Regent Street, London, was the first to open in Europe in November 2004, and is the most profitable shop in London with the highest sales per square foot, taking £60,000,000 pa, or £2,000 per square foot.[321] The Regent Street store was surpassed in size by the nearby Apple Store in Covent Garden, which was surpassed in size by the Grand Central Terminal Apple Store, New York City, in December 2011.\n Of the 43,000 Apple employees in the United States 30,000 work at Apple Stores. Apple Store employees make above average pay for retail employees and are offered money toward college as well as gym memberships, 401k plans, healthcare plans, product discounts, and reduced price on purchase of stock.[322]\n A May 2016 Business Insider article featuring a lengthy interview with a U.K. Apple Store retail worker highlighted significant dissatisfactions and issues for retail workers, including harassment and death threats from customers, an intense internal criticism policy that feels “like a cult”, a lack of any significant bonus if a worker manages to secure a business contract worth “hundreds of thousands”, a lack of promotion opportunities, and, despite a “generous” discount on any Apple product or Apple stock, are paid so little that many workers are unable to buy products themselves.[323]\n     \n \n  Fifth Avenue, New York City\n \n \n \n    \n \n  London\n \n \n \n    \n \n  Paris\n \n \n \n    \n \n  Sydney\n \n \n \n    \n \n  Hong Kong\n \n \n \n    \n \n  Barcelona\n \n \n \n  Corporate affairs See also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple, Braeburn Capital, and FileMaker Inc. \n Corporate culture Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the “1984” television commercial, Apple’s informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[324] According to a 2011 report in Fortune, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[325]\n     \n Steve Wozniak and Andy Hertzfeld in 1985\n \n \n \n As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned to the company. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs’s involvement often take longer than projects with it.[326] To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions topersonal computing while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including Bill Atkinson,[327] Steve Capps,[328] Rod Holt,[327] Alan Kay,[329][330] Guy Kawasaki,[329][331] Al Alcorn,[332] Don Norman,[329] Rich Page,[327] and Steve Wozniak.[327]\n At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having “best-in-class” employees in every role. For instance, Ron Johnson—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores (this was done by Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management).[333] Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a “directly responsible individual,” or “DRI” in Apple jargon.[325] As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple’s official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app, he was forced to resign.[334] Unlike other major U.S. companies Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.[335]\n An editorial article in The Verge in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the public’s perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has “matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design” and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products. He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating “Yes, iteration is boring. But it’s also how Apple does business. […] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success”. He acknowledges that people are wishing for the “excitement of revolution”, but argues that people want “the comfort that comes with harmony”. Furthermore, he writes that “a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned”, referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that Walkman didn’t have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the iCloud cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an Apple Watch can unlock a Mac in close proximity). He argues that Apple’s ecosystem is its greatest innovation.[336]\n Customer service In 1999 Apple retained Eight Inc. as a strategic retail design partner and began creating the Apple retail stores. Tim Kobe of Eight Inc. prepared an “Apple Retail” white paper for Jobs, outlining the ability of separate Apple retail stores to directly drive the Apple brand experience—Kobe used their recently completed work with The North Face and Nike as a basis for the white paper.[citation needed] The first two Apple Stores opened on May 19, 2001 in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and Glendale, California. More than 7,700 people visited Apple’s first two stores in the opening weekend, spending a total of US$599,000.[337] As of June 2014, Apple maintains 425 retail stores in fourteen countries.[338][339] In addition to Apple products, the stores sell third-party products like software titles, digital cameras, camcorders and handheld organizers.[340]\n A media article published in July 2013 provided details about Apple’s “At-Home Apple Advisors” customer support program that serves as the corporation’s call center. The advisors are employed within the U.S. and work remotely after undergoing a four-week training program and testing period. The advisors earn between US$9 and $12 per hour and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support.[341]\n Manufacturing The company’s manufacturing, procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple’s profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook’s catchphrase to describe his focus on the company’s operational arm is: “Nobody wants to buy sour milk”.[128][342]\n During the Mac’s early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.[343] This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple’s adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500/8500/9500 Power Macs. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as USB, AGP, HyperTransport, Wi-Fi, NVMe, PCIe and others in its products. FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as IEEE 1394 and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.[344]\n Labor practices Further information: Criticism of Apple Inc. § Labor practices \n The company advertised its products as being made in America until the late 1990s; however, as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by the New York Times, Apple insiders “believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that “Made in the U.S.A.” is no longer a viable option for most Apple products”.[345]\n In 2006, the Mail on Sunday reported on the working conditions of the Chinese factories where contract manufacturers Foxconn and Inventec produced the iPod.[346]The article stated that one complex of factories that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it. Employees regularly worked more than 60 hours per week and made around $100 per month. A little over half of the workers’ earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.[347][348][349]\n Apple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.[350] In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker’s rights, slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply. Yearly progress reports have been published since 2008.[351] In 2011, Apple admitted that its suppliers’ child labor practices in China had worsened.[352]\n The Foxconn suicides occurred between January and November 2010, when 18[353] Foxconn (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted suicide, resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.[353][354][355] The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.[356] Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:\n [Apple is] saddened and upset by the recent suicides at Foxconn … A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.[357]\n The statement was released after the results from the company’s probe into its suppliers’ labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple’s own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.[357] Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.[358]\n Also in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.[359] After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,[360] workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.[361] Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to n-hexane, a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.[362][363][364]\n A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple’s promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since 2010, Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: “We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions”.[358]\n In December 2014, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple’s iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in “primitive, dark and filthy dorms” where they sleep “on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.” Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.[365][366]\n Environmental practices and initiatives Energy and resources Following a Greenpeace protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.[367][368] By 2013 Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company’s power came from clean renewable sources.[369]\n In 2010, Climate Counts, a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category “Striding”.[370] This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a “stuck icon”, adding that Apple at the time was “a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer”.[371]\n As of 2016, 100% of Apple’s U.S. operations run on renewable energy, 100% of Apple’s data centers run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple’s global operations run on renewable energy.[372] The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple tablet, notebook, desktop computer, and display that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple’s data centers recycle water 35 times,[373] the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573 million gallons in 2015.[374]\n In May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, “Apple’s commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet.”[375]\n During an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016, 93% of Apple’s worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company’s efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably-managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.[376][377] Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maineand North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres of forests in China. Featured was the company’s installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple’s Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company’s energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple’s Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.[378]\n Apple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple’s efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.[379] Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly, 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from landfills.[380]\n Toxins Following further campaigns by Greenpeace,[381] in 2008, Apple became the first electronics manufacturer to fully eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) andbrominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line.[382][383] In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCDdisplays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro.[384][385][386][387] Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale.[388] In June 2009, Apple’s iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs.[384][389] All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product’s respective regulatory category.[384][390]\n In November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace’s Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how “green” their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10 down from 4.9.[391] Greenpeace praises Apple’s sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. It continues to score well on the products rating with all Apple products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions.[391] In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.[392]\n Green bonds In February 2016, Apple issued a US$1.5 billion green bond (climate bond), the first ever of its kind by a U.S. tech company. The green bond proceeds are dedicated to the financing of environmental projects.[393]\n Finance Apple is the world’s largest information technology company by revenue and the world’s second-largest mobile phone manufacturer.[9] It is also the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization, with an estimated market capitalization of $446 billion by January 2014.[394] On February 17, 2015, Apple became the first US corporation to be valued at over $750B.[395] As of March 2016, Apple maintains 475 retail stores in seventeen countries, of which 207 are outside the U.S.,[1] as well as the online Apple Store and iTunes Store, the latter of which is the world’s largest music retailer.[396] It employs 115,000 permanent full-time employees as of July 2015[4] and 3,300 temporary full-time employees as of September 2012 worldwide.[citation needed]\n In its fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. reported a total of $108 billion in annual revenues—a significant increase from its 2010 revenues of $65 billion—and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves.[397] On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plans for a $2.65-per-share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.[398] On September 2012, Apple reached a record share price of more than $705 and closed at above 700.[399] With 936,596,000 outstanding shares (as of June 30, 2012),[400]\n The company’s worldwide annual revenue in 2013 totaled $170 billion.[401] In May 2013, Apple entered the top ten of the Fortune 500 list of companies for the first time, rising 11 places above its 2012 ranking to take the sixth position.[402] As of 2016, Apple has around US$234 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which 90% is located outside the United States for tax purposes.[403]\n Apple amassed 65% of all profits made by the eight largest worldwide smartphone manufacturers in quarter one of 2014, according to a report by Canaccord Genuity.[404] In the first quarter of 2015, the company garnered 92% of all earnings made by the eight largest global smartphone makers.[404]\n Tax practices Further information: Criticism of Apple Inc. § Tax practices \n Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to The New York Times, in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the “Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich,” which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.[405]\n British Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke published research on October 30, 2012,[406] which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standardcorporation tax. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Googleand The Coca-Cola Company, to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.[407]\n It is a matter of public record that Apple Inc. is the single largest taxpayer to the Department of the Treasury of the United States of America with an effective tax rateof approximately of 26% as of the Second Quarter of the Apple Fiscal Year 2016.[408]\n In 2015, Reuters reported that Apple had earnings abroad of $54.4 billion which were untaxed by the IRS of the United States. Under U.S. tax law governed by theIRC, corporations don’t pay income tax on overseas profits unless the profits are repatriated into the United States and as such Apple argues that to benefit itsshareholders it will leave it overseas until a repatriation holiday or comprehensive tax reform takes place in the United States.[409][410]\n On August 30, 2016, after a three-year investigation by the EU’s competition commissioner that concluded that Apple received “illegal state aid” from Ireland, the EU ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), plus interest, in unpaid taxes.[411] Specifically, the commissioner found that Apple had benefitted from Irish Department of Revenue tax rulings that allowed it to split the profits recorded by Apple Sales International internally between its Irish branch and a stateless “head office” entity lacking employees or premises (permitted under Irish law until 2013).[412] The Chancellor of Austria, Christian Kern, put this decision into perspective by stating that “every Viennese cafe, every sausage stand pays more tax in Austria than a multinational corporation”.[413]\n Litigation Main article: Apple Inc. litigation \n Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.[414] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include Apple v. Samsung, Apple v. Microsoft, Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc., and Apple Corps v. Apple Computer. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question.[415] Most recently, on December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter’s products infringe on Nokia’s patents.[416][417]\n Privacy stance Apple has made clear its stance on privacy and as such has made available Transparency Reports on the Governmental Requests it receives. Apple states plainly, “On devices running iOS 8 and later versions, your personal data is placed under the protection of your passcode.[305] For all devices running iOS 8 and later versions, Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an encryption keythat is tied to the user’s passcode, which Apple does not possess.”[418]\n In its latest “Who Has Your Back?” report, once again the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) awarded Apple 5 out of 5 stars “commend[ing] Apple for its strong stance regarding user rights, transparency, and privacy.”[419]\n Following media reports about PRISM, NSA’s massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Apple. According to leaks of said program, Apple joined the PRISM program in 2012.[420]\n Charitable causes As of 2016, Apple is a partner of Product Red, a campaign whose mission is to prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child by 2015.[421][needs update] In June 2014, Apple’s contributions to the campaign reached $75 million, making the company Product Red’s largest partner.[422]\n In November 2012, Apple donated $2.5 million to the American Red Cross to aid relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy.[423]\n On April 14, 2016, Apple and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, “help protect life on our planet.” Apple released a special page in the iTunes App Store, Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF’s Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8 million in total proceeds to support WWF’s conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.[424][425][426]\n See also       Book: Apple Inc.\n       Apple media events\n Pixar\n  References    ^ Jump up to:a b c d “Apple Stores: Everything We Know”.

Android’s user interface is mainly based ondirect manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, andAndroid Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used onnotebooks, game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics.\n Android has the largest installed base of all operating systems (OS) of any kind.[b] Android has been the best selling OS on tablets since 2013, and on smartphones it is dominant by any metric.[15][16]\n Initially developed by Android, Inc., which Google bought in 2005,[17] Android was unveiled in 2007 along with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance – a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices.[18] As of July 2013, the Google Play store has had over one million Android applications (“apps”) published – including many “business-class apps”[19]that rival competing mobile platforms[20] – and over 50 billion applications downloaded.[21] An April–May 2013 survey of mobile application developers found that 71% of developers create applications for Android,[22] and a 2015 survey found that 40% of full-time professional developers see Android as their priority target platform, which is comparable to Apple‘s iOS on 37% with both platforms far above others.[23] In September 2015, Android had 1.4 billion monthly active devices.[24]\n Android’s source code is released by Google under open source licenses, although most Android devices ultimately ship with a combination of open source and proprietary software, including proprietary software required for accessing Google services.[3] Android is popular with technology companies that require a ready-made, low-cost and customizable operating system for high-tech devices.[25] Its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which deliver updates to older devices, add new features for advanced users[26] or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems. The success of Android has made it a target for patent (and copyright) litigation as part of the so-called “smartphone wars” between technology companies.[27][28]\n   Contents  [hide] \n \n  1History\n  2Features  2.1Interface\n 2.2Applications\n 2.3Memory management\n 2.4Virtual reality\n  \n 3Hardware\n  4Development  4.1Update schedule\n 4.2Linux kernel\n 4.3Software stack\n 4.4Open-source community\n  \n  5Security and privacy  5.1Scope of surveillance by public institutions\n 5.2Common security threats\n 5.3Technical security features\n  \n  6Licensing  6.1Leverage over manufacturers\n  \n  7Reception  7.1Market share\n 7.2Adoption on tablets\n 7.3Platform usage\n 7.4Application piracy\n  \n 8Legal issues\n 9Other uses\n 10See also\n 11Notes\n 12References\n 13External links\n  \n History See also: Android version history \n     \n Former Android logo wordmark (2007-2014)\n \n \n \n Android, Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California in October 2003 by Andy Rubin (co-founder of Danger),[29] Rich Miner(co-founder of Wildfire Communications, Inc.),[30] Nick Sears (once VP at T-Mobile),[31] and Chris White (headed design and interface development at WebTV[17]) to develop, in Rubin’s words, “smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner’s location and preferences”.[17] The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras. Though, when it was realized that the market for the devices was not large enough, the company diverted its efforts toward producing a smartphone operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile.[32] Despite the past accomplishments of the founders and early employees, Android Inc. operated secretly, revealing only that it was working on software for mobile phones.[17] That same year, Rubin ran out of money. Steve Perlman, a close friend of Rubin, brought him $10,000 in cash in an envelope and refused a stake in the company.[33]\n In July 2005, Google acquired Android Inc. for at least $50 million, whose key employees, including Rubin, Miner and White, stayed at the company after the acquisition.[15][17] Not much was known about Android Inc. at the time, but many assumed that Google was planning to enter the mobile phone market with this move.[17] At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers andcarriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradeable system. Google had lined up a series of hardware component and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation on their part.[34][35][36]\n Speculation about Google’s intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through December 2006.[37] An earlier prototype codenamed “Sooner” had a closer resemblance to a BlackBerry phone, with no touchscreen, and a physical, QWERTY keyboard, but was later re-engineered to support a touchscreen, to compete with other announced devices such as the 2006 LG Prada and 2007 Apple iPhone.[38][39] In September 2007, InformationWeek covered anEvalueserve study reporting that Google had filed several patent applications in the area of mobile telephony.[40][41]\n     \n Eric Schmidt, Andy Rubin and Hugo Barra at a 2012 press conference announcing Google’s Nexus 7 tablet\n \n \n \n On November 5, 2007, the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of technology companies including Google, device manufacturers such as HTC, Sony and Samsung, wireless carriers such as Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile, and chipset makers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, unveiled itself, with a goal to develop open standards for mobile devices.[18] That day, Android was unveiled as its first product, a mobile device platform built on the Linux kernel.[18][42] The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream, released on October 22, 2008.[43]\n Since 2008, Android has seen numerous updates which have incrementally improved the operating system, adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases. Each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat; for example, version 1.5 “Cupcake” was followed by 1.6 “Donut”. In 2010, Google launched its Nexus series of devices – a line of smartphones and tablets running the Android operating system, and built by manufacturing partners. HTC collaborated with Google to release the first Nexus smartphone,[44] the Nexus One. Google has since updated the series with newer devices, such as the Nexus 5 phone (made by LG) and the Nexus 7 tablet (made by Asus). Google releases the Nexus phones and tablets to act as theirflagship Android devices, demonstrating Android’s latest software and hardware features. From 2013 until 2015, Google offered several Google Play Edition devices over Google Play. While not carrying the Google Nexus branding, these were Google-customized Android phones and tablets that also ran the latest version of Android, free from manufacturer or carrier modifications.\n From 2010 to 2013, Hugo Barra served as product spokesperson, representing Android at press conferences and Google I/O, Google’s annual developer-focused conference. Barra’s product involvement included the entire Android ecosystem of software and hardware, including Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean and KitKat operating system launches, the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 smartphones, the Nexus 7[45] and Nexus 10 tablets,[46] and other related products such as Google Now[47] and Google Voice Search, Google’s speech recognition product comparable to Apple’s Siri.[47] In 2013, Barra left the Android team for Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi.[48] The same year, Larry Page announced in a blog post that Andy Rubin had moved from the Android division to take on new projects at Google.[49]He was replaced by Sundar Pichai who became the new head of Android and Chrome OS,[50] and, later, by Hiroshi Lockheimer when Pichai became CEO of Google.[51]\n In 2014, Google launched Android One, a line of smartphones mainly targeting customers in the developing world. In May 2015, Google announced Project Brillo as a cut-down version of Android that uses its lower levels (excluding the user interface), intended for the “Internet of Things” (IoT) embedded systems.[52]\n University of Cambridge research in 2015, concluded that almost 90% of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support.[53][54] In a year since (mid-2015) that report, well over a billion Android smartphones have been sold (more than the just over billion sold in 2014); and Android 5.0 (with better security) and later, went from 5.4% market share to currently over half, which means that the 90% number must be very outdated; those phones now very likely represent less than half of all Android phones. Recent devices do get security updates;[55][56] Android 5.0 introduced an improved centralized update system.[57][58]\n Features See also: List of features in Android \n Interface Android’s default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation,[59] using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard.[59] Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB.[60] The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors[61] are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented, or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel.[62]\n Android devices boot to the homescreen, the primary navigation and information “hub” on Android devices that is analogous to the desktop found on personal computers. (Android also runs on regular personal computers, as described below). Android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets; app icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content, such as the weather forecast, the user’s email inbox, or a news ticker directly on the homescreen.[63] A homescreen may be made up of several pages, between which the user can swipe back and forth, though Android’s homescreen interface is heavily customisable, allowing users to adjust the look and feel of the devices to their tastes.[64] Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the homescreen, and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as Windows Phone.[65] Most manufacturers, and some wireless carriers, customise the look and feel of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors.[66] Applications that handle interactions with the homescreen are called “launchers” because they, among other purposes, launch the applications installed on a device.\n Along the top of the screen is a status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity. This status bar can be “pulled” down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates, such as a newly received email or SMS text, in a way that does not immediately interrupt or inconvenience the user.[67] Notifications are persistent until read by tapping it, which opens the relevant app, or dismissed by sliding it off the screen. Beginning on Android 4.1, “expanded notifications” can display expanded details or additional functionality; for instance, a music player can display playback controls, and a “missed call” notification provides buttons for calling back or sending the caller an SMS message.[68]\n Android provides the ability to run applications that change the default launcher, and hence the appearance and externally visible behaviour of Android. These appearance changes include a multi-page dock or no dock, and many more changes to fundamental features of the user interface.[69]\n Applications See also: Android software development and Google Play \n Applications (“apps“), which extend the functionality of devices, are written using the Android software development kit (SDK) and, often, the Java programming language that has complete access to the Android APIs. Java may be combined with C/C++, together with a choice of non-default runtimes that allow better C++ support;[70][71][72] the Go programming language is also supported since its version 1.4, which can also be used exclusively although with a restricted set of Android APIs.[73] The SDK includes a comprehensive set of development tools,[74] including a debugger, software libraries, a handset emulator based on QEMU, documentation, sample code, and tutorials. Initially, Google’s supported integrated development environment (IDE) was Eclipse using the Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin; in December 2014, Google released Android Studio, based on IntelliJ IDEA, as its primary IDE for Android application development. Other development tools are available, including a native development kit (NDK) for applications or extensions in C or C++, Google App Inventor, a visual environment for novice programmers, and various cross platform mobile web applications frameworks. In January 2014, Google unveiled an framework based on Apache Cordova for porting Chrome HTML 5 web applications to Android, wrapped in a native application shell.[75]\n Android has a growing selection of third-party applications, which can be acquired by users by downloading and installing the application’s APK (Android application package) file, or by downloading them using an application store program that allows users to install, update, and remove applications from their devices. Google Play Store is the primary application store installed on Android devices that comply with Google’s compatibility requirements and license the Google Mobile Services software.[3][76] Google Play Store allows users to browse, download and update applications published by Google and third-party developers; as of July 2013, there are more than one million applications available for Android in Play Store.[77] As of July 2013, 50 billion applications have been installed.[78][79] Some carriers offer direct carrier billing for Google Play application purchases, where the cost of the application is added to the user’s monthly bill.[80]\n Due to the open nature of Android, a number of third-party application marketplaces also exist for Android, either to provide a substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship with Google Play Store, provide applications that cannot be offered on Google Play Store due to policy violations, or for other reasons. Examples of these third-party stores have included the Amazon Appstore, GetJar, and SlideMe. F-Droid, another alternative marketplace, seeks to only provide applications that are distributed under free and open source licenses.[3][81][82][83]\n Memory management Since Android devices are usually battery-powered, Android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum. When an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it does not use battery power or CPU resources.[84][85]\n Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting with those that have been inactive for longest.[86][87] Lifehacker reported in 2011 that third-party task killers were doing more harm than good.[88]\n Virtual reality At Google I/O on May 2016, Google announced Daydream, a virtual reality platform that relies on a smartphone and provides VR capabilities through a virtual reality headset and controller designed by Google itself.[89] The platform is built into Android starting with Android Nougat, differentiating from standalone support for VR capabilities. The software is available for developers, and was released in 2016.\n Hardware     \n HTC Dream or T-Mobile G1, the first commercially released device running Android (2008).\n \n \n \n See also: Android hardware requirements \n The main hardware platform for Android is the ARM (ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures), with x86 and MIPSarchitectures also officially supported in later versions of Android. Since Android 5.0 “Lollipop”, 64-bit variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the 32-bit variants.[90] The unofficial Android-x86 project provided support for the x86 architectures ahead of the official support.[6][91] MIPS architecture was also supported before Google did. Since 2012, Android devices with Intel processors began to appear, including phones[92] and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms, Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64.\n Requirements for the minimum amount of RAM for devices running Android 5.1 range from 512 MB of RAM for normal-density screens, to about 1.8 GB for high-density screens.[93] The recommendation for Android 4.4 is to have at least 512 MB of RAM,[94] while for “low RAM” devices 340 MB is the required minimum amount that does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the baseband processor.[95] Android 4.4 requires a 32-bit ARMv7,MIPS or x86 architecture processor (latter two through unofficial ports),[6][96] together with an OpenGL ES 2.0 compatiblegraphics processing unit (GPU).[97] Android supports OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 and as of latest major version, 3.2 and Vulkan. Some applications may explicitly require a certain version of the OpenGL ES, and suitable GPU hardware is required to run such applications.[97]\n Android devices incorporate many optional hardware components, including still or video cameras, GPS, orientation sensors, dedicated gaming controls,accelerometers, gyroscopes, barometers, magnetometers, proximity sensors, pressure sensors, thermometers, and touchscreens. Some hardware components are not required, but became standard in certain classes of devices, such as smartphones, and additional requirements apply if they are present. Some other hardware was initially required, but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether. For example, as Android was developed initially as a phone OS, hardware such as microphones were required, while over time the phone function became optional.[79] Android used to require an autofocus camera, which was relaxed to afixed-focus camera[79] if present at all, since the camera was dropped as a requirement entirely when Android started to be used on set-top boxes.\n In addition to running on smartphones and tablets, several vendors run Android natively on regular PC hardware with a keyboard and mouse.[98][99][100][101] In addition to their availability on commercially available hardware, similar PC hardware-friendly versions of Android are freely available from the Android-x86 project, including customized Android 4.4.[102] Using the Android emulator that is part of the Android SDK, or by using BlueStacks or Andy, Android can also run non-natively on x86.[103][104] Chinese companies are building a PC and mobile operating system, based on Android, to “compete directly with Microsoft Windows and Google Android”.[105] The Chinese Academy of Engineering noted that “more than a dozen” companies were customising Android following a Chinese ban on the use of Windows 8 on government PCs.[106][107][108]\n Development     \n Android green figure, next to its original packaging\n \n \n \n Android is developed in private by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released, at which point the source code is made available publicly.[109] This source code will only run without modification on select devices, usually theNexus series of devices. The source code is, in turn, adapted by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to run on their hardware.[110] Android’s source code does not contain the often proprietary device drivers that are needed for certain hardware components.[111]\n In 2007, the green Android logo was designed for Google by graphic designer Irina Blok. The design team was tasked with a project to create a universally identifiable icon with the specific inclusion of a robot in the final design. After numerous design developments based on science-fiction and space movies, the team eventually sought inspiration from the human symbol on restroom doors and modified the figure into a robot shape. As Android is open-sourced, it was agreed that the logo should be likewise, and since its launch the green logo has been reinterpreted into countless variations on the original design.[112]\n Update schedule See also: Android version history \n Google provides major incremental upgrades to Android every six to nine months, with confectionery-themed names, which most devices are capable of receivingover the air.[113] The latest major release is Android 7.0 “Nougat”.\n Compared to its primary rival mobile operating system, iOS, Android updates typically reach various devices with significant delays. Except for devices with theGoogle Nexus brand, updates often arrive months after the release of the new version, or not at all.[114] This is partly due to the extensive variation in hardware of Android devices, to which each upgrade must be specifically tailored, as the official Google source code only runs on their own Nexus devices. Porting Android to specific hardware is a time- and resource-consuming process for device manufacturers, who prioritize their newest devices and often leave older ones behind.[114]Hence, older smartphones are frequently not updated if the manufacturer decides it is not worth the investment of resources, although the device may be compatible. This problem is compounded when manufacturers customize Android with their own interface and apps, which must be reapplied to each new release. Additional delays can be introduced by wireless carriers who, after receiving updates from manufacturers, further customize and brand Android to their needs and conduct extensive testing on their networks before sending the upgrade out to users.[114]\n The lack of after-sale support from manufacturers and carriers has been widely criticized by consumer groups and the technology media.[115][116] Some commentators have noted that the industry has a financial incentive not to upgrade their devices, as the lack of updates for existing devices fuels the purchase of newer ones,[117] an attitude described as “insulting”.[116] The Guardian complained that the method of distribution for updates is complicated only because manufacturers and carriers have designed it that way.[116] In 2011, Google partnered with a number of industry players to announce an “Android Update Alliance”, pledging to deliver timely updates for every device for 18 months after its release;[118] however, there has not been another official word about that alliance since its announcement.[114][119]\n In 2012, Google began decoupling certain aspects of the operating system (particularly core applications) so they could be updated through Google Play Storeindependently of the operating system. One of these components, Google Play Services, is a closed-source system-level process providing APIs for Google services, installed automatically on nearly all devices running Android version 2.2 and higher. With these changes, Google can add new operating system functionality through Play Services and application updates without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself. As a result, Android 4.2 and 4.3 contained relatively fewer user-facing changes, focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements.[3][120]\n In May 2016, it was announced that Google is considering “shaming” smartphone makers who fail to release updated versions of Android to their devices.[121]\n Linux kernel Android’s kernel is based on one of the Linux kernel‘s long-term support (LTS) branches. Since April 2014, Android devices mainly use versions 3.4, 3.10 or 3.18 of the Linux kernel.[122][123] The specific kernel version depends on the actual Android device and its hardware platform;[124][125][126] Android has used various kernel versions since the version 2.6.25 that was used in Android 1.0.[42]\n Android’s variant of the Linux kernel has further architectural changes that are implemented by Google outside the typical Linux kernel development cycle, such as the inclusion of components like Binder, ashmem, pmem, logger, wakelocks, and different out-of-memory (OOM) handling.[127][128][129] Certain features that Google contributed back to the Linux kernel, notably a power management feature called “wakelocks”, were rejected by mainline kernel developers partly because they felt that Google did not show any intent to maintain its own code.[130][131][132] Google announced in April 2010 that they would hire two employees to work with the Linux kernel community,[133] but Greg Kroah-Hartman, the current Linux kernel maintainer for the stable branch, said in December 2010 that he was concerned that Google was no longer trying to get their code changes included in mainstream Linux.[131] Some Google Android developers hinted that “the Android team was getting fed up with the process,” because they were a small team and had more urgent work to do on Android.[134]\n In August 2011, Linus Torvalds said that “eventually Android and Linux would come back to a common kernel, but it will probably not be for four to five years”.[135] In December 2011, Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the start of Android Mainlining Project, which aims to put some Android drivers, patches and features back into the Linux kernel, starting in Linux 3.3.[136] Linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the 3.5 kernel, after many previous attempts at merger. The interfaces are the same but the upstream Linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes: to memory (the traditional suspend that Android uses), and to disk (hibernate, as it is known on the desktop).[137] Google maintains a public code repository that contains their experimental work to re-base Android off the latest stable Linux versions.[138][139]\n The flash storage on Android devices is split into several partitions, such as /system for the operating system itself, and /data for user data and application installations.[140] In contrast to desktop Linux distributions, Android device owners are not given root access to the operating system and sensitive partitions such as /system are read-only. However, root access can be obtained by exploiting security flaws in Android, which is used frequently by the open-source community to enhance the capabilities of their devices,[141] but also by malicious parties to install viruses and malware.[142]\n Android is a Linux distribution according to the Linux Foundation,[143] Google’s open-source chief Chris DiBona,[144] and several journalists.[145][146] Others, such as Google engineer Patrick Brady, say that Android is not Linux in the traditional Unix-like Linux distribution sense; Android does not include the GNU C Library (it usesBionic as an alternative C library) and some of other components typically found in Linux distributions.[147]\n Software stack     \n Android’s architecture diagram\n \n \n \n On top of the Linux kernel, there are the middleware, libraries and APIs written in C, and application software running on an application framework which includes Java-compatible libraries. Development of the Linux kernel continues independently of other Android’s source code bases.\n Until version 5.0, Android used Dalvik as a process virtual machine with trace-based just-in-time (JIT) compilation to run Dalvik “dex-code” (Dalvik Executable), which is usually translated from the Java bytecode. Following the trace-based JIT principle, in addition to interpreting the majority of application code, Dalvik performs the compilation and native execution of select frequently executed code segments (“traces”) each time an application is launched.[148][149][150] Android 4.4 introduced Android Runtime(ART) as a new runtime environment, which uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to entirely compile the application bytecode into machine code upon the installation of an application. In Android 4.4, ART was an experimental feature and not enabled by default; it became the only runtime option in the next major version of Android, 5.0.[151]\n For its Java library, the Android platform uses a subset of the now discontinued Apache Harmonyproject.[152] In December 2015, Google announced that the next version of Android would switch to a Java implementation based on OpenJDK.[153]\n Android’s standard C library, Bionic, was developed by Google specifically for Android, as a derivation of the BSD‘s standard C library code. Bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to the Linux kernel. The main benefits of using Bionic instead of the GNU C Library (glibc) or uClibc are its smaller runtime footprint, and optimization for low-frequency CPUs. At the same time, Bionic is licensed under the terms of the BSD licence, which Google finds more suitable for the Android’s overall licensing model.[150]\n Aiming for a different licensing model, toward the end of 2012, Google switched the Bluetooth stack in Android from the GPL-licensed BlueZ to the Apache-licensed BlueDroid.[154]\n Android does not have a native X Window System by default, nor does it support the full set of standard GNU libraries. This made it difficult to port existing Linux applications or libraries to Android,[147] until version r5 of the Android Native Development Kit brought support for applications written completely in C or C++.[155]Libraries written in C may also be used in applications by injection of a small shim and usage of the JNI.[156]\n Since Marshmallow, “Toybox“, a collection of command line utilities (mostly for use by apps, as Android doesn’t provide a command line interface by default), replaced similar “Toolbox” collection.[157]\n Android has another operating system, Trusty OS, within it, as a part of “Trusty” “software components supporting a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on mobile devices.” “Trusty and the Trusty API are subject to change. [..] Applications for the Trusty OS can be written in C/C++ (C++ support is limited), and they have access to a small C library. [..] All Trusty applications are single-threaded; multithreading in Trusty userspace currently is unsupported. [..] Third-party application development is not supported in” the current version, and software running on the OS and processor for it, run the “DRM framework for protected content. [..] There are many other uses for a TEE such as mobile payments, secure banking, full-disk encryption, multi-factor authentication, device reset protection, replay-protected persistent storage, wireless display (“cast”) of protected content, secure PIN and fingerprint processing, and even malware detection.”[158]\n Open-source community Android has an active community of developers and enthusiasts who use the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system.[159] These community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels, with a comparable level of quality;[26] provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates; or bring Android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems, such as the HP TouchPad. Community releases often come pre-rooted and contain modifications not provided by the original vendor, such as the ability to overclock or over/undervolt the device’s processor.[160] CyanogenMod is the most widely used community firmware,[161] and acts as a foundation for numerous others. Android-x86 is a version of Android for IBM PC compatibles. There have also been attempts with varying degrees of success to port Android to iPhones, notably the iDroid Project.[162]\n Historically, device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of third-party firmware development. Manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the support costs resulting from this.[163] Moreover, modified firmwares such as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features, such as tethering, for which carriers would otherwise charge a premium. As a result, technical obstacles including locked bootloaders and restricted access to root permissions are common in many devices. However, as community-developed software has grown more popular, and following a statement by the Librarian of Congress in the United States that permits the “jailbreaking” of mobile devices,[164] manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding third party development, with some, including HTC,[163] Motorola,[165] Samsung[166][167] and Sony,[168] providing support and encouraging development. As a result of this, over time the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an increasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable bootloaders, similar to Nexus series of phones, although usually requiring that users waive their devices’ warranties to do so.[163] However, despite manufacturer acceptance, some carriers in the US still require that phones are locked down, frustrating developers and customers.[169]\n Security and privacy See also: Mobile security and WARRIOR PRIDE \n Scope of surveillance by public institutions As part of the broader 2013 mass surveillance disclosures it was revealed in September 2013 that the American and British intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA) and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), respectively, have access to the user data on iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android devices. They are reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and notes.[170] In January 2014, further reports revealed the intelligence agencies’ capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted across the Internet by social networks and other popular applications such as Angry Birds, which collect personal information of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons. GCHQ has, according to The Guardian, a wiki-style guide of different apps and advertising networks, and the different data that can be siphoned from each.[171] Later that week, the Finnish Angry Birds developerRovio announced that it was reconsidering its relationships with its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations, and called upon the wider industry to do the same.[172]\n The documents revealed a further effort by the intelligence agencies to intercept Google Maps searches and queries submitted from Android and other smartphones to collect location information in bulk.[171] The NSA and GCHQ insist their activities are in compliance with all relevant domestic and international laws, although the Guardian stated “the latest disclosures could also add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects and uses information, especially for those outside the US, who enjoy fewer privacy protections than Americans.”[171]\n Common security threats Research from security company Trend Micro lists premium service abuse as the most common type of Android malware, where text messages are sent from infected phones to premium-rate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user.[173] Other malware displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device, or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties.[173] Security threats on Android are reportedly growing exponentially; however, Google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on Android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons,[174][175] and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users.[174] Google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare,[175] and a survey conducted by F-Secure showed that only 0.5% of Android malware reported had come from the Google Play store.[176]\n Android’s fragmentation is a problem for security, since patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-price devices.[177][178] One set of researchers say that the failure of vendors to support older devices with patches and updates leaves more than 87% of active devices vulnerable.[179][180] However, the open-source nature of Android allows security contractors to take existing devices and adapt them for highly secure uses. For example, Samsung has worked with General Dynamics through their Open Kernel Labs acquisition to rebuild Jelly Bean on top of their hardened microvisor for the “Knox” project.[181][182]\n Android smartphones have the ability to report the location of Wi-Fi access points, encountered as phone users move around, to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points. These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones, allowing them to run apps likeFoursquare, Google Latitude, Facebook Places, and to deliver location-based ads.[183] Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid,[184] an academic research-funded project, can, in some cases, detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers.[185]\n Technical security features Android applications run in a sandbox, an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the system’s resources, unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed. Before installing an application, Play Store displays all required permissions: a game may need to enable vibration or save data to an SD card, for example, but should not need to read SMS messages or access the phonebook. After reviewing these permissions, the user can choose to accept or refuse them, installing the application only if they accept.[186] The sandboxing and permissions system lessens the impact of vulnerabilities and bugs in applications, but developer confusion and limited documentation has resulted in applications routinely requesting unnecessary permissions, reducing its effectiveness.[187] Google has now pushed an update to Android Verify Apps feature, which will now run in background to detect malicious processes and crack them down.[188]\n In Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the permissions system was changed to allow the user to control an application’s permissions individually, to block applications if desired from having access to the device’s contacts, calendar, phone, sensors, SMS, location, microphone and camera.[189] Full permission control is only possible with rootaccess to the device.[190]\n Google uses Google Bouncer malware scanner to watch over and scan applications available in the Google Play Store.[191] It is intended to flag suspicious apps and warn users of any potential threat with an application before they download it.[192] Android version 4.2 Jelly Bean was released in 2012, with enhanced security features, including a malware scanner built into the system, which works in combination with Google Play but can scan apps installed from third party sources as well, and an alert system which notifies the user when an app tries to send a premium-rate text message, blocking the message unless the user explicitly authorises it.[193]Several security firms, such as Lookout Mobile Security,[194] AVG Technologies,[195] and McAfee,[196] have released antivirus software for Android devices. This software is ineffective as sandboxing also applies to such applications, limiting their ability to scan the deeper system for threats.[197][198]\n In August 2013, Google released Android Device Manager (ADM), a component that allows users to remotely track, locate, and wipe their Android device through a web interface.[120][199] In December 2013, Google released ADM as an Android application on the Google Play store, where it is available to devices running Android version 2.2 and higher.[200][201]\n Licensing The source code for Android is open-source: it is developed in private by Google, with the source code released publicly when a new version of Android is released. Google publishes most of the code (including network and telephony stacks) under the non-copyleft Apache License version 2.0. which allows modification and redistribution.[202][203] The license does not grant rights to the “Android” trademark, so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from Google under individual contracts. Associated Linux kernel changes are released under the copyleft GNU General Public License version 2, developed by the Open Handset Alliance, with the source code publicly available at all times. Typically, Google collaborates with a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship device (part of the Nexus series) featuring the new version of Android, then makes the source code available after that device has been released.[204] The only Android release which was not immediately made available as source code was the tablet-only 3.0 Honeycomb release. The reason, according to Andy Rubin in an official Android blog post, was because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom,[205] and they did not want third parties creating a “really bad user experience” by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of Android intended for tablets.[206]\n Only the base Android operating system (including some applications) is open-source software, whereas most Android devices ship with a substantial amount of proprietary software, such as Google Mobile Services, which includes applications such as Google Play Store, Google Search, and Google Play Services – a software layer that provides APIs for the integration with Google-provided services, among others. These applications must be licensed from Google by device makers, and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements.[76][120] Custom, certified distributions of Android produced by manufacturers (such as TouchWiz and HTC Sense) may also replace certain stock Android apps with their own proprietary variants and add additional software not included in the stock Android operating system.[3] There may also be “binary blob” drivers required for certain hardware components in the device.[3][111]\n Some stock applications in AOSP code that were formerly used by earlier versions of Android, such as Search, Music, and Calendar, have been abandoned by Google in favor of non-free replacements distributed through Play Store (Google Search, Google Play Music, and Google Calendar) that are no longer open-source. Moreover, open-source variants of some applications also exclude functions that are present in their non-free versions, such as Photosphere panoramas in Camera, and a Google Now page on the default home screen (exclusive to the proprietary version “Google Now Launcher”, whose code is embedded within that of the main Google application).[3][207][208][209]\n Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have been critical of Android and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as Replicant, because drivers and firmware vital for the proper functioning of Android devices are usually proprietary, and because the Google Play Store application can forcibly install or deinstall applications and, as a result, invite non-free software.[210][211]\n Leverage over manufacturers Google licenses their Google Mobile Services software, along with Android trademarks, only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet Google’s compatibility standards specified in the Android Compatibility Program document.[212] Thus, forks of Android that make major changes to the operating system itself do not include any of Google’s non-free components, stay incompatible with applications that require them, and must ship with an alternative software marketplace in lieu of Google Play Store.[3] Examples of such Android forks are Amazon‘s Fire OS (which is used on the Kindle Fire line of tablets, and oriented toward Amazon services), the Nokia X Software Platform (a fork used by the Nokia X family, oriented primarily toward Nokia and Microsoft services), and other forks that exclude Google apps due to the general unavailability of Google services in certain regions (such as China).[213][214] In 2014, Google also began to require that all Android devices which license the Google Mobile Services software display a prominent “Powered by Android” logo on their boot screens.[76]\n Members of the Open Handset Alliance, which include the majority of Android OEMs, are also contractually forbidden from producing Android devices based on forks of the OS;[3][215] in 2012, Acer Inc. was forced by Google to halt production on a device powered by Alibaba Group‘s Aliyun OS with threats of removal from the OHA, as Google deemed the platform to be an incompatible version of Android. Alibaba Group defended the allegations, arguing that the OS was a distinct platform from Android (primarily using HTML5 apps), but incorporated portions of Android’s platform to allow backwards compatibility with third-party Android software. Indeed, the devices did ship with an application store which offered Android apps; however, the majority of them were pirated.[216][217][218]\n Reception     \n Android-x86 running on an ASUSEeePC netbook; Android has been unofficially ported to traditional PCs for use as a desktop operating system.\n \n \n \n Android received a lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in 2007. Although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with Google to form the Open Handset Alliance, it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with Android.[219] The idea of an open-source, Linux-based development platform sparked interest,[220] but there were additional worries about Android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market, such as Nokia and Microsoft, and rival Linux mobile operating systems that were in development.[221] These established players were skeptical: Nokia was quoted as saying “we don’t see this as a threat,”[222] and a member of Microsoft’s Windows Mobile team stated “I don’t understand the impact that they are going to have.”[222]\n Since then Android has grown to become the most widely used smartphone operating system[25][223] and “one of the fastest mobile experiences available.”[224] Reviewers have highlighted the open-source nature of the operating system as one of its defining strengths, allowing companies such as Nokia (Nokia X family),[225] Amazon (Kindle Fire), Barnes &amp; Noble (Nook),Ouya, Baidu and others to fork the software and release hardware running their own customised version of Android. As a result, it has been described by technology website Ars Technica as “practically the default operating system for launching new hardware” for companies without their own mobile platforms.[25] This openness and flexibility is also present at the level of the end user: Android allows extensive customisation of devices by their owners and apps are freely available from non-Google app stores and third party websites. These have been cited as among the main advantages of Android phones over others.[25][226]\n Despite Android’s popularity, including an activation rate three times that of iOS, there have been reports that Google has not been able to leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn Android into the money maker that analysts had expected.[227] The Verge suggested that Google is losing control of Android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of non-Google apps and services – Amazon’s Kindle Fire line uses Fire OS, a heavily modified fork of Android which does not include or support any of Google’s proprietary components, and requires that users obtain software from its competing Amazon Appstoreinstead of Play Store.[3] In 2014, in an effort to improve prominence of the Android brand, Google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary components display an Android logo on the boot screen.[76]\n Android has suffered from “fragmentation”,[228] a situation where the variety of Android devices, in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them, makes the task of developing applications that work consistently across the ecosystem harder than rival platforms such as iOS where hardware and software varies less. For example, according to data from OpenSignal in July 2013, there were 11,868 models of Android device, numerous different screen sizes and eight Android OS versions simultaneously in use, while the large majority of iOS users have upgraded to the latest iteration of that OS.[229] Critics such as Apple Insider have asserted that fragmentation via hardware and software pushed Android’s growth through large volumes of low end, budget-priced devices running older versions of Android. They maintain this forces Android developers to write for the “lowest common denominator” to reach as many users as possible, who have too little incentive to make use of the latest hardware or software features only available on a smaller percentage of devices.[230] However, OpenSignal, who develops both Android and iOS apps, concluded that although fragmentation can make development trickier, Android’s wider global reach also increases the potential reward.[229]\n Market share Main article: Usage share of operating systems \n Research company Canalys estimated in the second quarter of 2009, that Android had a 2.8% share of worldwide smartphone shipments.[231] By the fourth quarter of 2010, this had grown to 33% of the market becoming the top-selling smartphone platform,[232] overtaking Symbian.[233] By the third quarter of 2011, Gartnerestimated that more than half (52.5%) of the smartphone sales belonged to Android.[234] By the third quarter of 2012 Android had a 75% share of the global smartphone market according to the research firm IDC.[235]\n In July 2011, Google said that 550,000 Android devices were being activated every day,[236] up from 400,000 per day in May,[237] and more than 100 million devices had been activated[238] with 4.4% growth per week.[236] In September 2012, 500 million devices had been activated with 1.3 million activations per day.[239][240] In May 2013, at Google I/O, Sundar Pichai announced that 900 million Android devices had been activated.[241]\n Android market share varies by location. In July 2012, “mobile subscribers aged 13+” in the United States using Android were up to 52%,[242] and rose to 90% in China.[243] During the third quarter of 2012, Android’s worldwide smartphone shipment market share was 75%,[235] with 750 million devices activated in total. In April 2013 Android had 1.5 million activations per day.[240] As of May 2013, 48 billion applications (“apps”) have been installed from the Google Play store,[244] and by September 2013, one billion Android devices have been activated.[245]\n As of July 2013, the Google Play store has had over one million Android applications published, and over 50 billion applications downloaded.[21] A developer survey conducted in April–May 2013 found that Android is used by 71% of mobile developers.[22] The operating system’s success has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so-called “smartphone wars” between technology companies.[27][28]\n Android devices account for more than half of smartphone sales in most markets, including the US, while “only in Japan was Apple on top” (September–November 2013 numbers).[246] At the end of 2013, over 1.5 billion Android smartphones have been sold in the four years since 2010,[247][248] making Android the most sold phone and tablet OS. Three billion Android smartphones are estimated to be sold by the end of 2014 (including previous years). According to Gartner research company, Android-based devices outsold all contenders, every year since 2012.[249] In 2013, it outsold Windows 2.8:1 or by 573 million.[250][251][252] As of 2015, Android has the largest installed base of all operating systems;[15] Since 2013, devices running it also sell more than Windows, iOS and Mac OS X devices combined.[253]\n According to StatCounter, which tracks only the use for browsing the web, Android is the most popular mobile operating system since August 2013.[254] Android is the most popular operating system for web browsing in India and several other countries (e.g. virtually all of Asia, with Japan and North Korea exceptions). According to StatCounter, Android is most used on mobile in all African countries, and it stated “mobile usage has already overtaken desktop in several countries including India, South Africa and Saudi Arabia”,[255] with virtually all countries in Africa having done so already (except for seven countries, including Egypt), such as Ethiopia and Kenya in which mobile (including tablets) usage is at 90.46% (Android only, accounts for 75.81% of all use there[256]).[257]\n While Android phones in the Western world commonly include Google’s proprietary add-ons (such as Google Play) to the otherwise open-source operating system, this is increasingly not the case in emerging markets; “ABI Research claims that 65 million devices shipped globally with open-source Android in the second quarter of [2014], up from 54 million in the first quarter”; depending on country, percent of phones estimated to be based only on Android’s source code (AOSP), forgoing the Android trademark: Thailand (44%), Philippines (38%), Indonesia (31%), India (21%), Malaysia (24%), Mexico (18%), Brazil (9%).[258]\n According to a January 2015 Gartner report, “Android surpassed a billion shipments of devices in 2014, and will continue to grow at a double-digit pace in 2015, with a 26 percent increase year over year.” This made it the first time that any general-purpose operating system has reached more than one billion end users within a year: by reaching close to 1.16 billion end users in 2014, Android shipped over four times more than iOS and OS X combined, and over three times more thanMicrosoft Windows. Gartner expected the whole mobile phone market to “reach two billion units in 2016”, including Android.[259]\n According to a Statistica‘s estimate, Android smartphones had an installed base of 1.8 billion units in 2015, which was 76% of the estimated total number of smartphones worldwide.[260][261][c] Android has the largest installed base of any mobile operating system and, since 2013, the highest-selling operating system overall[250][253][263][264][265] with sales in 2012, 2013 and 2014[266] close to the installed base of all PCs.[267] In the third quarter of 2015, Android’s share of the global smartphone shipment market was 84.7%, the highest ever.[268] As of September 28, 2016, with 52.5% market share, Samsung remains the leading OEM for shipping Android running smartphoens and tablets, followed by followed by LG, Huawei, Motorola, Lenovo, Sony, HTC, Asus, Alcatel and Xiaomi.[269]\n By August 2016, the two biggest continents have gone mobile-majority, judged by web use (“desktop” has 46.92%–55.16% use worldwide, depending on day of the week, making some weeks desktop-minority;[270] lowest full month was at 50.05%[271]); because of Android (see usage share of operating systems), that has majority use on smartphones in virtually all countries (all continents have gone Android-majority, including North America[272][273] except for Oceania, because of Australia),[274] with few exceptions (all of which have iOS-majority); in the US, Android is close to iOS, having exchanged majority position a few times,[275] Canada and the following are also exceptions: Japan, Philippines, Australia and the only exceptions in Europe are the UK, Switzerland, Belgium and the Nordic countries Denmark, Iceland, Sweden and Norway.[276]\n By 2016, Android was on the majority of smartphones in virtually all countries in the world,[16][277] excluding United States and Canada (while including North America continent as a whole[278]), Australia and Japan. A few countries, such as the UK, lose Android-majority if tablets are included.\n Adoption on tablets     \n The first-generation Nexus 7 tablet, running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean\n \n \n \n Despite its success on smartphones, initially Android tablet adoption was slow.[279] One of the main causes was the chicken or the egg situation where consumers were hesitant to buy an Android tablet due to a lack of high quality tablet applications, but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources developing tablet applications until there was a significant market for them.[280][281] The content and app “ecosystem” proved more important than hardware specs as the selling point for tablets. Due to the lack of Android tablet-specific applications in 2011, early Android tablets had to make do with existing smartphone applications that were ill-suited to larger screen sizes, whereas the dominance of Apple’s iPad was reinforced by the large number of tablet-specific iOS applications.[281][282]\n Despite app support in its infancy, a considerable number of Android tablets (alongside those using other operating systems, such as the HP TouchPad and BlackBerry PlayBook) were rushed out to market in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the iPad.[281] InfoWorld has suggested that some Android manufacturers initially treated their first tablets as a “Frankenphone business”, a short-term low-investment opportunity by placing a smartphone-optimized Android OS (before Android 3.0 Honeycomb for tablets was available) on a device while neglecting user interface. This approach, such as with the Dell Streak, failed to gain market traction with consumers as well as damaging the early reputation of Android tablets.[283][284] Furthermore, several Android tablets such as the Motorola Xoom were priced the same or higher than theiPad, which hurt sales. An exception was the Amazon Kindle Fire, which relied upon lower pricing as well as access to Amazon’s ecosystem of applications and content.[281][285]\n This began to change in 2012, with the release of the affordable Nexus 7 and a push by Google for developers to write better tablet applications.[286] According to International Data Corporation, shipments of Android-powered tablets surpassed iPads in Q3 2012.[287]\n As of the end of 2013, over 191.6 million Android tablets had sold in three years since 2011.[288][289] This made Android tablets the most-sold type of tablet in 2013, surpassing iPads in the second quarter of 2013.[290]\n According to the StatCounter’s June 2015 web use statistics, Android tablets represent the majority of tablet devices used on the South American[291] (then lost majority) and African continents (60.23%),[292] while they have equaled with the iPad’s market share in major countries on all continents (with the North America as an exception, though in El Salvador Android has the majority[293]), and getting close to representing the majority on the whole Asian continent[294] having done so already in India (65.9%),[295] Indonesia (62.22%),[296] and most Middle-Eastern countries.[297] In about half of the European countries, Android tablets have a majority market share.[298] China is an exception for the major developing countries, in which Android phablets (classified as smartphones while similar in size to tablets) are more popular than Android tablets or iPads.\n By March 2016, Infoworld stated that Android tablets and smartphones can be a “real part of your business [..] there’s no longer a reason to keep Android at arm’s length. It can now be as integral to your mobile portfolio as Apple’s iOS devices are”[19] as they have “business-class apps”,[19] no longer just “OK for email”.[19] In 2015, they stated that “Microsoft’s Office UI is better on iOS and Android”[20] than in Microsoft’s own mobile app for Windows.\n Platform usage    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Nougat (0.4%)\n    Marshmallow (26.3%)\n    Lollipop (34.0%)\n    KitKat (24.0%)\n    Jelly Bean (12.8%)\n    Ice Cream Sandwich (1.2%)\n    Gingerbread (1.2%)\n    Froyo (0.1%)\n \n \n \n Charts in this section provide breakdowns of Android versions, based on devices accessing the Google Play Store in a seven-day period ending on December 5, 2016.[299][d] Therefore, these statistics exclude devices running various Android forks that do not access the Google Play Store, such as Amazon’s Fire tablets.\n    Version Code name Release date API level DVM/ART Distribution First devices to run version     7.1 Nougat October 4, 2016 25 ART less than 0.1% Pixel   7.0 August 22, 2016 24 ART 0.4%  Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P    6.0 Marshmallow October 5, 2015 23 ART 26.3%   5.1 Lollipop March 9, 2015 22 ART 23.2% Android One   5.0 November 3, 2014 21 ART 2.1.0 10.8% Nexus 6   4.4 KitKat October 31, 2013 19  DVM (and ART 1.6.0)  24.0% Nexus 5   4.3 Jelly Bean July 24, 2013 18 DVM 1.9% Nexus 7 2013   4.2 November 13, 2012 17 DVM 6.4%  Nexus 4, Nexus 10    4.1 July 9, 2012 16 DVM 4.5% Nexus 7   4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich December 16, 2011 15 DVM 1.2% Galaxy Nexus   2.3.3+ Gingerbread February 9, 2011 10 DVM 1.4.0 1.2% Nexus S   2.2 Froyo May 20, 2010 8 DVM 0.1% Droid 2     Since May 2016, more than half of devices have OpenGL ES 3.0 or higher.\n Application piracy In general, paid Android applications can easily be pirated.[300] In a May 2012 interview with Eurogamer, the developers of Football Manager stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was 9:1 for their game Football Manager Handheld.[301] However, not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue; for example, in July 2012 the developers of the game Wind-up Knight said that piracy levels of their game were only 12%, and most of the piracy came from China, where people cannot purchase apps from Google Play.[302]\n In 2010, Google released a tool for validating authorized purchases for use within apps, but developers complained that this was insufficient and trivial to crack. Google responded that the tool, especially its initial release, was intended as a sample framework for developers to modify and build upon depending on their needs, not as a finished piracy solution.[303] Android “Jelly Bean” introduced the ability for paid applications to be encrypted, so that they may work only on the device for which they were purchased.[304][305]\n Legal issues Further information: Oracle v. Google, Smartphone wars, and Patent troll \n Both Android and Android phone manufacturers have been involved in numerous patent lawsuits. On August 12, 2010, Oracle sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the Java programming language.[306] Oracle originally sought damages up to $6.1 billion,[307] but this valuation was rejected by a United States federal judge who asked Oracle to revise the estimate.[308] In response, Google submitted multiple lines of defense, counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle’s patents or copyright, that Oracle’s patents were invalid, and several other defenses. They said that Android’s Java runtime environment is based on Apache Harmony, a clean room implementation of the Java class libraries, and an independently developed virtual machine calledDalvik.[309] In May 2012, the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle’s patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable.[310][311] The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for a small amount of copied code.[312] On May 9, 2014, theFederal Circuit partially reversed the district court ruling, ruling in Oracle’s favor on the copyrightability issue, and remanding the issue of fair use to the district court.[313][314]\n In December 2015, Google announced that the next major release of Android (Android Nougat) would switch to OpenJDK, which is the official open-source implementation of the Java platform, instead of using the now-discontinued Apache Harmony project as its runtime. Code reflecting this change was also posted to the AOSP source repository.[152] In its announcement, Google claimed this was part of an effort to create a “common code base” between Java on Android and other platforms.[153] Google later admitted in a court filing that this was part of an effort to address the disputes with Oracle, as its use of OpenJDK code is governed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) with a linking exception, and that “any damages claim associated with the new versions expressly licensed by Oracle under OpenJDK would require a separate analysis of damages from earlier releases”.[152] In June 2016, a United States federal court ruled in favor of Google, stating that its use of the APIs was fair use.[315]\n In addition to lawsuits against Google directly, various proxy wars have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices, with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to market.[316] Both Apple and Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement, with Apple’s ongoing legal action against Samsung being a particularly high-profile case. In October 2011, Microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with ten Android device manufacturers, whose products account for “70% in the U.S.”. and 55% of the worldwide revenue for Android devices.[317] These include Samsung and HTC.[318] Samsung’s patent settlement with Microsoft included an agreement to allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system.[316] Microsoft has also tied its own Android software to patent licenses, requiring the bundling of Microsoft Office Mobile and Skype applications on Android devices to subsidize the licensing fees, while at the same time helping to promote its software lines.[319][320]\n Google has publicly expressed its frustration for the current patent landscape in the United States, accusing Apple, Oracle and Microsoft of trying to take down Android through patent litigation, rather than innovating and competing with better products and services.[321] In September 2011, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion, which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect Android, since Motorola Mobility held more than 17,000 patents.[322] In December 2011, Google bought over a thousand patents from IBM.[323]\n In 2013, FairSearch, a lobbying organization supported by Microsoft, Oracle and others, filed a complaint regarding Android with the European Commission, alleging that its free-of-charge distribution model constituted anti-competitive predatory pricing. The Free Software Foundation Europe, whose donors include Google, disputed the Fairsearch allegations.[324] On April 20, 2016, the EU filed a formal antitrust complaint against Google based upon the FairSearch allegations, arguing that its leverage over Android vendors, including the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary Google software, hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into Android, and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of Android, constituted anti-competitive practices.[325]\n Other uses     \n Ouya, a video game console which runs Android\n \n \n \n The open and customizable nature of Android allows it to be used on other electronics aside from smartphones and tablets, including laptops and netbooks, smartbooks,[326] smart TVs (Android TV, Google TV) and cameras (E.g. Galaxy Camera).[327]In addition, the Android operating system has seen applications on smart glasses (Google Glass), smartwatches,[328]headphones,[329] car CD and DVD players,[330] mirrors,[331] portable media players,[332] landline[333] and Voice over IP phones.[334] Ouya, a video game console running Android, became one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns,crowdfunding US$8.5m for its development,[335][336] and was later followed by other Android-based consoles, such as Nvidia‘sShield Portable – an Android device in a video game controller form factor.[337]\n In 2011, Google demonstrated “Android@Home”, a home automation technology which uses Android to control a range of household devices including light switches, power sockets and thermostats.[338] Prototype light bulbs were announced that could be controlled from an Android phone or tablet, but Android head Andy Rubin was cautious to note that “turning a lightbulb on and off is nothing new”, pointing to numerous failed home automation services. Google, he said, was thinking more ambitiously and the intention was to use their position as a cloud services provider to bring Google products into customers’ homes.[339][340]\n Parrot unveiled an Android-based car stereo system known as Asteroid in 2011,[341] followed by a successor, the touchscreen-based Asteroid Smart, in 2012.[342] In 2013, Clarion released its own Android-based car stereo, the AX1.[343] In January 2014, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Google announced the formation of the Open Automotive Alliance, a group including several major automobile makers (Audi, General Motors, Hyundai, and Honda) and Nvidia, which aims to produce Android-based in car entertainment systems for automobiles, “[bringing] the best of Android into the automobile in a safe and seamless way.”[344]\n On March 18, 2014, Google announced Android Wear, an Android-based platform specifically intended for smartwatches and other wearable devices; only a developer preview was made publicly available.[345] This was followed by the unveiling of two Android-Wear-based devices, the LG G Watch and Moto 360.[346]\n On June 25, 2014, at Google I/O, it was announced that Android TV, a Smart TV platform, is replacing the previously released Google TV. Google also announcedAndroid Auto for use in cars.[347]\n Android comes preinstalled on a few laptops (a similar functionality of running Android applications is also available in Google’s Chrome OS) and can also be installed on personal computers by end users.[348] On those platforms Android provides additional functionality for physical keyboards[349] and mice, together with the “Alt-Tab” key combination for switching applications quickly with a keyboard. In December 2014, one reviewer commented that Android’s notification system is “vastly more complete and robust than in most environments” and that Android is “absolutely usable” as one’s primary desktop operating system.[350]\n In October 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that Android will serve as Google’s future main laptop operating system, with the plan to fold Chrome OS into it by 2017.[351][352] Google’s Sundar Pichai, who led the development of Android, explained that “mobile as a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of as desktop today.”[351] and back in 2009, Google co-founder Sergey Brin himself said that Chrome OS and Android would “likely converge over time.”[353]Lockheimer, who replaced Pichai as head of Android and Chrome OS, responded to this claim with an official Google blog post stating that “While we’ve been working on ways to bring together the best of both operating systems, there’s no plan to phase out Chrome OS [which has] guaranteed auto-updates for five years”.[354] That is unlike Android where support is shorter with “EOL dates [being..] at least 3 years [into the future] for Android tablets for education”.[355]\n See also   Comparison of mobile operating systems\n Index of Android OS articles\n List of most downloaded Android applications\n Rooting (Android OS)\n Stagefright (bug)\n Android lawn statues\n  \n    Alphabet portal \n  Free software portal \n  Google portal \n  \n Notes    Jump up^ Official 64-bit support for all platforms was introduced in Android 5.0 “Lollipop”. \n  Jump up^ Operating systems for microcontrollers are a special case, and not considered here, as they are not meant to be general purpose computers.

Yasin did not want to leave his home in Samarra but his father said that it was best for the family because it was not safe to live there anymore and he wanted his son to grow up in a country that was accepting of all people. Yasin’s father told his son that England was a multicultural country where people lived and worked together regardless of race or religious beliefs.\n http://www.worldstories.org.uk/video/player.swf\n Although Yasin was not happy about leaving Iraq, he soon settled into his new life in a big city called London. London was very exciting with its tall buildings and museums, and Yasin especially liked the London Planetarium and the big River Thames with all of its old bridges.\n Yasin even made friends with a boy who lived next door called Andrew. All summer long Andrew and Yasin played in the park or went to the zoo with Andrew’s mum. Andrew shared his toys and his comics with Yasin and told him all about his favourite superheroes. They even built a camp in Yasin’s back garden where they would hide from the grownups.\n The summer was a fun time and young Yasin soon felt quite at home in London even though it was a very big city and not nearly as sunny and hot as it was in Samarra. His English got better and better, especially with help from Andrew, although there were a lot of words that Yasin did not understand and he often felt silly because he could not speak as well as he would like.\n When September finally came around and the leaves began to fall from the trees, Yasin’s father explained that it was time for his son to go to school. Yasin was seven years old so he would be going to year three of the local primary school – the same year as his friend Andrew!\n Although Yasin was very nervous about going to school, his father and mother assured him that it would be a fun place where he would meet lots of new friends and learn lots of interesting new things. ‘English schools are supposed to be very good,’ said Yasin’s mother.\n ‘And you will learn some very interesting things and your English will get better in no time,’ assured his father.\n Yasin was still not convinced, but when Andrew knocked on the door that morning with a big smile on his face saying how fun it was going to be at school, Yasin felt much better because he trusted his friend.\n The two boys chatted all the way to the school gates: Andrew told Yasin about the playground and who was the best teacher and what boys were the most fun and what girls were pretty and how they often served custard for pudding at lunchtimes. Yasin did not know what custard was, but Andrew looked very excited about it so Yasin thought it must taste very good.\n But when the boys got to their class, things did not go how Yasin imagined they would. The teacher told Andrew to take a seat at the front of the class as she introduced Yasin to the rest of the children. He did not like standing up in front of the class and one boy shouted out that he was a smelly foreigner. The boys and girls all laughed, and then another boy made fun of Yasin’s accent when he was asked to say his name and where he came from. ‘I can’t understand him, miss. He can’t even speak English,’ said the nasty boy.\n Finally Yasin was allowed to take a seat at the back of the class, but he wished that he was next to Andrew as he felt very alone. The girl sitting beside him kept looking at him in a strange way that made Yasin uncomfortable, and during the lesson she put her hand up and asked the teacher if she could move places. Yasin did not understand what he had done to offend the girl.\n When the bell went it was time to go out into the playground. All of the children closed their books and put on their coats and headed out of the door into the bright autumn sunshine. The teacher kept Yasin back for a moment and gave him a badge with his name on which she pinned to his jumper. ‘There you go,’ she said with a smile. ‘Now all of the children will be able to learn your name.’\n Yasin thought that the badge looked silly, and when he went out into the playground all of the children began pointing and laughing. ‘You’ve got a girl’s name,’ said a small boy with curly blond hair.\n Yasin wanted to explain that it was not a girl’s name but he was too nervous because all of the children were pointing at him and laughing. When Yasin got nervous his English was not very good and the words always got stuck in his throat. He was very sad and wanted to run out of the playground back to his mother and father and never return to school again. But just as he was about to run, he heard a familiar voice. ‘Hi Yasin.’ And when he looked up there was Andrew standing right beside him.\n Andrew looked at the children gathered around and shook his head. ‘What’s wrong with you lot?’ he asked. ‘I told my friend Yasin that school was fun. Why are you ruining it for him?’\n ‘He’s different,’ said a very tall girl who was standing at the front of the crowd of children.\n ‘So are you,’ said Andrew. ‘You are the tallest girl in the whole school and you don’t like it when people make fun of you, do you?’\n Then Andrew looked at the boy with the curly hair. ‘And you don’t like it when people say that you have girl’s hair,’ he said to the boy. ‘We are all different and that is what makes us interesting. What would life be like if we were all the same as one another?’\n There was silence among the children. Then Yasin lifted his head high. ‘Boring,’ he said with a smile.\n ‘That’s right!’ exclaimed Andrew, returning his friend’s smile. ‘Flippin’ boring!’\n And with that all of the children began to laugh. ‘Flippin’ boring,’ they chanted at one another.\n Andrew went on to explain how he had spent the summer with Yasin, how they had built a camp together and played in the park, and how Yasin preferred Batman to Superman, and how he really was different because he didn’t even like hotdogs!\n The children all laughed some more and soon everybody was talking about all the things that made them different from one another. Peter Jenkins even lifted up his jumper and showed everybody a big purple birthmark on the front of his belly. ‘Now that’s what I call different,’ he said triumphantly. ‘I bet none of you have a big birthmark like mine!’\n When break time was over, Andrew put his hand up in class and suggested to the teacher that they should spend the lesson talking about how great it was that everybody was so different from everybody else and how people came to England from all over the world to begin a new life like his friend Yasin. The teacher agreed that it was important to be an individual, and she also said how wonderful it was that the whole of Britain was such a multicultural island. Yasin wrote these two words down in his book and promised himself that he would learn them both and remember them always. He also wrote the word friend in his book. He already knew what friend meant, but he just wanted to write it down because he felt so lucky to have a good friend like Andrew who stood up for people and did not judge them just because they were different.\n  \n \n   Author  jersnetPosted on December 27, 2016Leave a comment on a good frnds     Half a Year in Grã-Bretanha   January\n ‘Why does it always rain here?’ Natalia asked her mother.\n Natalia’s mother looked up from her newspaper in surprise. ‘It rains in Brazil too,’ she said. ‘Don’t you remember? It’s summer there now but it will rain in the winter.’\n Natalia shivered and looked out of the window at the rainy streets of England. She could no more imagine going outside in a swimming costume right now than going to the moon. She looked back at the computer on the little desk in the library. The screen was showing half a dozen photos of her friend Rita on the beach. Rita looked tanned and happy and Natalia felt a pang of jealousy.\n ‘It’s nearly time to go,’ said Mamãe. ‘The library is closing. Finish your email and then let’s get home.’\n Natalia took her seat at the computer and finished off the email to her friend Rita:\n I miss everyone in Rio, especially you! It’s cold and rainy here. Your photos are cool.\n Love Natalia xxx\n February\n February soon followed January, and it wasn’t long before Natalia received news from her friend Rita once more...\n Hi Natalia,\n It’s so hot here! We are all getting ready for Carnival. I am getting my costume ready and uncle Rufino is playing tambourim in the Samba School again. It’s getting so close! Wish you were here.\n Rita xx\n ‘Carnival,’ Natalia sighed to herself. It was the best time of year in Rio de Janeiro. ‘I wish I was back in Brazil now,’ she thought as she typed away at the computer in the library...\n Hi Rita,\n Thanks for your photos! Tomorrow I’m going to my friend Emma’s house to make pancakes for Shrove Tuesday. We’ll have sugar and lemon on them but it won’t be the same as Carnival. It is still cold here and it seems to rain all the time!\n Natalia xxxxx\n As Natalia and Mamãe walked home through the dark and rainy streets, the young girl listened to the rain splashing from the car tyres travelling up and down the road beside her. She imitated the sound of the rain to cheer herself up... ‘Schwoosh, schwoosh, schwoosh, schwoosh!’ Then she began stamping her foot on the wet pavement... Splat, splat, splat, splat. And over the top of the schwooshing and splatting noises, Natalia imagined she could hear the distinctive samba rhythm that she remembered hearing everywhere in Rio, played on caxixi shakers and other beautiful instruments. Chuki-chuk, paf! chuki-chuki, paf! chuki-chuki, paf! chuki-chuki, paf!\n And so Natalia cheered herself up in the rain by schwooshing and splatting and chuki-chuki paffing all the way home.\n March\n Hi Natalia!\n How is England? Today we went to the beach and we were one short for volleyball. You are the best of our cousins at volleyball and so we all missed you very much!\n It’s really hot here still. I am drinking a lot of coconut water to keep cool! I took a photo for you so you won’t forget!\n Love Rita xxxx\n Hi Rita,\n I miss coconut water! And açai juice with granola. But most of all I miss cupuaçu juice! I wish we had cupuaçu here. We have peaches and melon but nothing tastes as good as back home.\n Natalia xxxxx\n April\n Spring was beginning to break in England as Natalia sat with her friend Emma at the computer screen during after school club.\n ‘Look at this, Emma!’ Natalia exclaimed in excitement. ‘Rita has sent me some photos of Botafogo playing against Fluminese.’\n Emma moved closer to the screen so that she could get a better look at the pictures of men running about in their colourful sports clothes. ‘Who are they?’ she asked.\n ‘They are Rio football teams,’ Natalia replied, unable to disguise the excitement in her voice. ‘Football in Brazil is so good! I wish I could take you to a match so that you could see for yourself. They have samba bands playing in the terraces, and whenever there is a goal scored the crowd goes crazy! The bands play so loudly and everyone chants and sings. It’s like a big party. Look, I’ll show you!’\n Natalia searched on the internet and found a video of a Brazilian football match so that she could show Emma. It was very loud and full of colour with the big surdo drum beating out a rhythm loudest of all... Ba-boom, boom, boom! Ba-boom, boom, boom! Ba-boom, boom, boom!\n The two girls searched for more videos of football games in Rio. They watched the city come to life through the screen: the sounds flowed out into the darkening classroom while the colours flickered and danced on the walls. Natalia tried to imagine that she was back home in Aunt Susana and Uncle Feliciano’s apartment on the hill, in the room she shared with Rita and her other cousins Alicia and Marina. The room was always warm and the girls always had fun looking out over the city at night. Suddenly Natalia felt very far away from home and this made her quite sad.\n June\n The seasons had changed from spring to early summer, and a milky pale sunshine often woke Natalia by shining through the curtains of her bedroom window in the early morning. Unlike Rio, it was a gentle heat that made everything shimmer. The flowerbeds in the park near the school buzzed with insects, bees went about collecting nectar to make honey, and Natalia noticed how everybody seemed to be smiling more now that the sun was out.\n Dear Rita,\n Today Emma and I played tennis at school. It’s really fun! It’s Wimbledon here so lots of people are excited about the tennis. We got to watch it at school and had strawberries and cream. It was really fun. It is finally sunny here and really quite beautiful!\n Xxx\n Hi Natalia,\n We have tennis here too, remember? But I don’t like playing when it’s too hot. Sounds like you are having fun in England but here it is even more fun!\n Here are some photos of João and me when we went on a school trip to the Botanical Gardens.\n Xxxx\n When Natalia read this latest email she could not help being annoyed with her friend Rita. It seemed that Rita was always saying how much better things were in Brazil, even though she must know that Natalia missed her home very much. In the end, the two friends ended up arguing and decided not to write to each other for a while. Natalia realised then more than ever how difficult it was being away from home and adjusting to a new country, and she was disappointed that her friend Rita was so unsympathetic.\n \n July\n It was a hot summer, school was over and Natalia found herself all alone. Emma had gone to visit her grandma in Scotland and Mamãe was at work all the time. Natalia was bored and missed home very much. She was tired of watching the same shows on television: the ones with stupid people dressed up as furry monsters always singing silly songs. She was even bored of drawing. All she could ever think to draw was the beach in Rio with people sitting under parasols drinking coconut water, or playing volleyball, or surfing in the warm sea. It made her sad.\n Mamãe had shown Natalia how to lock the front door so that she could walk herself to the library when she wanted to. This made Natalia feel very grownup, but each time she walked to the library and logged on to the computer, she was always disappointed to find that she had no emails from her friend Rita. Natalia was very upset that they had argued and she missed hearing news from home.\n But one day there was an email, not from Rita but from Natalia’s English friend Emma....\n Hi Natalia,\n How are you? My mum asked me if you might want to come and stay with my grandma and me next month? My grandma is very old but very nice, and Scotland is fun.\n Love Emma xxx\n Natalia could not believe her luck! She ran home and waited for her mother to return from work so that she could ask to go to Scotland.\n August\n Scotland was so different from London! Emma’s grandma lived by the sea in a tiny village. In the evenings it stayed light for a long time and they went down to the beach. There were raspberries growing in the hedgerows so that you could pick them and eat them any time you wanted to. Natalia had never seen them growing wild before and was amazed when Emma picked them straight from the bushes for the first time.\n And on the first day Natalia saw something even more exciting than wild raspberries... The sea!\n ‘The sea, the sea!’ she exclaimed. ‘Let’s put our toes in the water!’ And before Emma could stop her, Natalia threw off her shoes and ran towards the waves. But when the clear blue water swirled around her ankles, Natalia shrieked in surprise.\n ‘It’s so cold!’ she cried out to Emma.\n ‘I tried to tell you!’ Emma laughed, ‘but you ran in too quickly! It’s not like Rio. The water is very cold here in Scotland.’\n They skipped in and out of the surf and watched the waves crashing against the rocks until their toes were numb with cold. Natalia felt happy for the first time in ages and she remembered playing on the beach with Rita and João and the other cousins back home. She saw a tiny boat tied to a little wooden jetty further along the beach and the young girl thought to herself: ‘We could sail all the way round the coast of Scotland and across the Atlantic Ocean in that little boat. We would pass America and Mexico, and then the water would begin to get warmer and warmer until eventually we would wash up on the shore in Rio!’\n Natalia imagined how everyone would be so pleased to see them and they would have cupuaçu and açai juice and eat feijoada and moqueca. There would be a band playing to welcome them just like the celebrations when a goal is scored on the pitch for Botafogo...Schwoosh, schwoosh, splat splat, chuki-chuki-paf, chuki-chuki-paf!\n Natalia and Emma played all day long until the sun began to fade. They talked about the differences between England and Scotland and Rio. They explored and walked, and they chased each other up and down the beach until they were exhausted. Then, when evening had set in and there was a cold chill in the air, the two friends headed home for dinner.\n That night, curled up in bed in Emma’s grandma’s little cottage on the coast, Natalia thought how lucky she was to be able to experience other cultures and to make new friends so far away from home. ‘England may be wet,’ she thought, ‘and the sea in Scotland in very cold, but there is always something to appreciate in a new culture, always something to admire and something to learn.’\n Before she went to sleep that night, Natalia promised herself that she would write to Rita and say sorry for their silly argument and tell her all about Scotland and the little cottage on the coast, and how she was even hoping that it might snow in England that winter. That is something Natalia had never seen in Rio de Janeiro!\n \n   Author  jersnetPosted on December 27, 2016Leave a comment on Half a Year in Grã-Bretanha    Posts navigation  Page 1 Page 2 … Page 4 Next page \n   \n   Text Widget This is a text widget.

Indeed, World War II ushered in the zenith of U.S. power in what came to be called the<a title=\"American Century\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Century target=_blank>American Century</a>, as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#CITEREFLeffler2010 target=_blank>Leffler 2010</a>, p. 67, indicates: “Truman presided over the greatest military and economic power the world had ever known. War production had lifted the United States out of the Great Depression and had inaugurated an era of unimagined prosperity. Gross national product increased by 60 percent during the war, total earnings by 50 percent. Despite social unrest, labor agitation, racial conflict, and teenage vandalism, Americans had more discretionary income than ever before. Simultaneously, the U.S. government had built up the greatest war machine in human history. By the end of 1942, the United States was producing more arms than all the Axis states combined, and, in 1943, it made almost three times more armaments than did the Soviet Union. In 1945, the United States had two-thirds of the world’s gold reserves, three-fourths of its invested capital, half of its shipping vessels, and half of its manufacturing capacity. Its GNP was three times that of the Soviet Union and more than five times that of Britain. It was also nearing completion of the atomic bomb, a technological and production feat of huge costs and proportions.”</span> </li>\n <li id=cite_note-134> <span class=mw-cite-backlink><b><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_ref-134 target=_blank><span class=cite-accessibility-label>Jump up</span>^</a></b></span> <span class=reference-text><cite class=\"citation web\"><a class=\"external text\" href=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612221444/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/pubs/fs/55407.htm rel=nofollow target=_blank>“The United States and the Founding of the United Nations, August 1941 – October 1945”</a>.

target=_blank>Linus Torvalds</a>, at the time a 21-year-old <a title=\"Computer science\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science target=_blank>computer science</a> student at the <a title=\"University of Helsinki\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Helsinki target=_blank>University of Helsinki</a>, <a title=Finland href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland target=_blank>Finland</a>, started working on some simple ideas for an operating system. He started with a <a title=\"Context switch\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch target=_blank>task switcher</a> in <a title=\"X86 assembly language\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language target=_blank>Intel 80386 assembly language</a> and a <a class=mw-redirect title=\"Pseudo terminal\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_terminal target=_blank>terminal driver</a>. On 25 August 1991, Torvalds posted the following to <i>comp.os.minix</i>, a <a title=\"Usenet newsgroup\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup target=_blank>newsgroup</a> on<a title=Usenet href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet target=_blank>Usenet</a>:<sup id=cite_ref-Torvlads25Aug91_17-0 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-Torvlads25Aug91-17 target=_blank>[17]</a></sup></p>\n <blockquote class=templatequote> <p>I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) <a title=\"IBM Personal Computer/AT\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer/AT target=_blank>AT</a>clones. This has been brewing since April, and is starting to get ready. I’d like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).</p>\n <p>I’ve currently ported <a title=\"Bash (Unix shell)\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) target=_blank>bash</a>(1.08) and <a title=\"GNU Compiler Collection\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection target=_blank>gcc</a>(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I’ll get something practical within a few months […] Yes – it’s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that’s all I have :-(.</p>\n <p>[…] It’s mostly in C, but most people wouldn’t call what I write C. It uses every conceivable feature of the 386 I could find, as it was also a project to teach me about the 386. As already mentioned, it uses a <a title=\"Memory management unit\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit target=_blank>MMU</a>, for both paging (not to disk yet) and segmentation. It’s the segmentation that makes it REALLY 386 dependent (every task has a 64Mb segment for code &amp; data – max 64 tasks in 4Gb. Anybody who needs more than 64Mb/task – tough cookies). […] Some of my “C”-files (specifically mm.c) are almost as much assembler as C. […] Unlike minix, I also happen to LIKE <a title=Interrupt href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt target=_blank>interrupts</a>, so interrupts are handled without trying to hide the reason behind them.</p>\n </blockquote> <p>After that, many people contributed code to the project. Early on, the <a title=MINIX href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX target=_blank>MINIX</a> community contributed code and ideas to the Linux kernel. At the time, the <a title=\"GNU Project\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project target=_blank>GNU Project</a>had created many of the components required for a free operating system, but its own kernel, <a title=\"GNU Hurd\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd target=_blank>GNU Hurd</a>, was incomplete and unavailable. The <a title=\"Berkeley Software Distribution\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution target=_blank>BSD</a> operating system had not yet freed itself from <a title=\"Berkeley Software Distribution\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution#Net.2F2_and_legal_troubles target=_blank>legal encumbrances</a>. Despite the limited functionality of the early versions, Linux rapidly accumulated developers and users.</p>\n <p>By September 1991, version 0.01 of the Linux kernel was released on the FTP server (ftp.funet.fi) of the Finnish University and Research Network (<a title=FUNET href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUNET target=_blank>FUNET</a>). It had 10,239 lines of code. In October 1991, version 0.02 of the Linux kernel was released.<sup id=cite_ref-18 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-18 target=_blank>[18]</a></sup></p>\n <p>In December 1991, Linux kernel 0.11 was released. This version was the first to be <a title=Self-hosting href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting target=_blank>self-hosted</a> as Linux kernel 0.11 could be compiled by a computer running the same kernel version. When Torvalds released version 0.12 in February 1992, he adopted the <a title=\"GNU General Public License\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License target=_blank>GNU General Public License</a> (GPL) over his previous self-drafted license, which had not permitted commercial redistribution.<sup id=cite_ref-Relnotes-0.12_19-0 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-Relnotes-0.12-19 target=_blank>[19]</a></sup></p>\n <p>A newsgroup known as <i>alt.os.linux</i> was started, and on 19 January 1992, the first post to alt.os.linux was made.<sup id=cite_ref-20 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-20 target=_blank>[20]</a></sup> On 31 March 1992, alt.os.linux became<i>comp.os.linux</i>.<sup id=cite_ref-21 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-21 target=_blank>[21]</a></sup></p>\n <p>The <a title=\"X Window System\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System target=_blank>X Window System</a> was soon ported to Linux. In March 1992, Linux version 0.95 was the first to be capable of running X. This large version number jump (from 0.1x to 0.9x) was due to a feeling that a version 1.0 with no major missing pieces was imminent. However, this proved to be somewhat overoptimistic, and from 1993 to early 1994, 15 development versions of version 0.99 appeared.</p>\n <p>On 14 March 1994, Linux kernel 1.0.0 was released, with 176,250 lines of code. In March 1995, Linux kernel 1.2.0 was released, with 310,950 lines of code.</p>\n <p>Version 2 of the Linux kernel, released on 9 June 1996, was followed by additional major versions under the version 2 header:</p>\n <ul> <li>25 January 1999 – release of Linux kernel 2.2.0 (1,800,847 lines of code)</li>\n <li>18 December 1999 – <a title=\"IBM mainframe\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_mainframe target=_blank>IBM mainframe</a> patches for 2.2.13 were published, allowing Linux kernel to be used on enterprise-class machines</li>\n <li>4 January 2001 – release of Linux kernel 2.4.0 (3,377,902 lines of code)</li>\n <li>17 December 2003 – release of Linux kernel 2.6.0 (5,929,913 lines of code)</li>\n </ul> <p>Starting in 2004, the release process changed and new kernels started coming out on a regular schedule every 2–3 months, numbered 2.6.0, 2.6.1, up through 2.6.39.</p>\n <p>On 21 July 2011, Torvalds announced the release of Linux kernel 3.0: “Gone are the 2.6.&lt;bignum&gt; days”.<sup id=cite_ref-3.0_release_22-0 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-3.0_release-22 target=_blank>[22]</a></sup> The version bump is not about major technological changes when compared to Linux 2.6.39;<sup id=cite_ref-23 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-23 target=_blank>[23]</a></sup> it marks the kernel’s 20th anniversary.<sup id=cite_ref-24 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-24 target=_blank>[24]</a></sup> The time-based release process remained the same.</p>\n <p>Version 3.10 of the Linux kernel, released in June 2013, contains 15,803,499 lines of code,<sup id=cite_ref-25 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-25 target=_blank>[25]</a></sup> while the version 4.1, released in June 2015, has grown to over 19.5 million lines of code contributed by almost 14,000 programmers.<sup id=cite_ref-26 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-26 target=_blank>[26]</a></sup></p>\n <h3> <span id=Tanenbaum.E2.80.93Torvalds_debate class=mw-headline>Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate</span><span class=mw-editsection><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>[</span><a title=\"Edit section: Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linux_kernel&action=edit&section=2\" target=_blank>edit</a><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>]</span></span> </h3> <div class=hatnote>Main article: <a title=\"Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate target=_blank>Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate</a> </div>\n <p>The fact that Linux is a <a title=\"Monolithic kernel\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel target=_blank>monolithic kernel</a> rather than a <a title=Microkernel href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel target=_blank>microkernel</a> was the topic of a debate between <a title=\"Andrew S.

As a result, any released version of the Linux kernel is fully usable, even if, for example, device drivers do not support all features of the hardware they are written for.</p>\n <p>The conceptual architecture of the Linux kernel has proved its success, while essential factors for this success were the provision for the organization of developers, and the provision for system extensibility. The Linux kernel’s architecture was required to support many independent volunteer developers, which suggested that the system portions that require the most development—hardware device drivers, file systems and network protocols—be implemented in an extensible fashion. The Linux kernel’s architecture chose to make these systems extensible using a data abstraction technique – each hardware device driver is implemented as a separate module that supports a common interface. In this way, a single developer can add a new device driver, with minimal interaction required with other developers of the Linux kernel.</p>\n <p>Another important extension to the Linux kernel is the addition of more supported hardware platforms. The architecture of the system supports this extensibility by separating all hardware-specific code into distinct modules within each subsystem. In this way, a small group of developers can implement a port of the Linux kernel to a new hardware architecture by re-implementing only the machine-specific portions of the kernel.</p>\n <h3> <span id=Estimated_cost_to_redevelop class=mw-headline>Estimated cost to redevelop</span><span class=mw-editsection><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>[</span><a title=\"Edit section: Estimated cost to redevelop\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linux_kernel&action=edit&section=29\" target=_blank>edit</a><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The cost to redevelop the Linux kernel version 2.6.0 in a traditional proprietary development setting has been estimated to be US$612 million (€467M, £394M) in 2004 prices using the <a title=COCOMO href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO target=_blank>COCOMO</a> man-month estimation model.<sup id=cite_ref-124 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-124 target=_blank>[124]</a></sup> In 2006, a study funded by the European Union put the redevelopment cost of kernel version 2.6.8 higher, at €882M ($1.14bn, £744M).<sup id=cite_ref-125 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-125 target=_blank>[125]</a></sup></p>\n <p>This topic was revisited in October 2008 by Amanda McPherson, Brian Proffitt and Ron Hale-Evans.

This branch is officially released as a new version approximately every ten weeks, after Torvalds does an initial round of integrating major changes made by all other programmers, and several rounds of bug-fix pre-releases.</p>\n <p>As of 2015, in the current development scheme, the main branch of development is not a traditional “stable” branch; instead, it incorporates all kinds of changes, including both the latest features, and security and bug fixes. For users who do not want to risk updating to new versions containing code that may not be well tested, a separate set of “stable” branches exist, one for each released version, which are meant for people who just want the security and bug fixes, but not a whole new version. These branches are maintained by the <i>stable team</i> (<a title=\"Greg Kroah-Hartman\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman target=_blank>Greg Kroah-Hartman</a>, <a title=\"Chris Wright (programmer)\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wright_(programmer) target=_blank>Chris Wright</a>, and others).</p>\n <p>The development model for the 2.6 kernel series was significantly different compared to the 2.5 series. Before the 2.6 series, there was a stable branch (2.4) where only relatively minor and safe changes were merged, and an unstable branch (2.5), where bigger changes and cleanups were allowed. Both of these branches had been maintained by the same set of people, led by Torvalds. This meant that users would always have a well-tested 2.4 version with the latest security and bug fixes to use, though they would have to wait for the features which went into the 2.5 branch. The downside of this was that the “stable” kernel ended up so far behind that it no longer supported recent hardware and lacked needed features. In the late 2.5 kernel series, some maintainers elected to try backporting of their changes to the stable kernel series, which resulted in bugs being introduced into the 2.4 kernel series. The 2.5 branch was then eventually declared stable and renamed to 2.6. But instead of opening an unstable 2.7 branch, the kernel developers decided to continue putting major changes into the 2.6 branch, which would then be released at a pace faster than 2.4.x but slower than 2.5.x. This had the desirable effect of making new features more quickly available and getting more testing of the new code, which was added in smaller batches and easier to test.</p>\n <p>As a response to the lack of a <i>stable</i> kernel tree where people could coordinate the collection of bug fixes as such, in December 2005 <a class=new title=\"Adrian Bunk (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adrian_Bunk&action=edit&redlink=1\" target=_blank>Adrian Bunk</a> announced that he would keep releasing 2.6.16.y kernels when the stable team moved on to 2.6.17.<sup id=cite_ref-129 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-129 target=_blank>[129]</a></sup><sup id=cite_ref-2.6.16-longterm_130-0 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-2.6.16-longterm-130 target=_blank>[130]</a></sup> He also included some driver updates, making the maintenance of the 2.6.16 series very similar to the old rules for maintenance of a stable series such as 2.4.<sup id=cite_ref-131 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-131 target=_blank>[131]</a></sup> Since then, the “stable team” had been formed, and it would keep updating kernel versions with bug fixes.

source code used to be maintained without the help of an automated <a class=mw-redirect title=\"Source code management\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_management target=_blank>source code management</a> system, mostly because of Linus Torvalds’ dislike of centralized SCM systems.</p>\n <p>In 2002, Linux kernel development switched to <a title=BitKeeper href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper target=_blank>BitKeeper</a>, an SCM system which satisfied Torvalds’ technical requirements. BitKeeper was made available to Linus and several others free of charge, but was not <a title=\"Free software\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software target=_blank>free software</a>, which was a source of controversy. The system did provide some interoperability with free SCM systems such as <a title=\"Concurrent Versions System\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System target=_blank>CVS</a> and <a class=mw-redirect title=\"Subversion (software)\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software) target=_blank>Subversion</a>.</p>\n <p>In April 2005, however, efforts to reverse-engineer the BitKeeper system by <a title=\"Andrew Tridgell\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tridgell target=_blank>Andrew Tridgell</a> led BitMover, the company which maintained BitKeeper, to stop supporting the Linux development community. In response, Torvalds and others wrote a new source code control system for the purpose, called <a class=mw-redirect title=\"Git (software)\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software) target=_blank>Git</a>. The new system was written within weeks, and in two months the first official kernel release was made using Git.<sup id=cite_ref-307 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-307 target=_blank>[305]</a></sup> Git soon developed into a separate project in its own right and gained widespread adoption.</p>\n <h3> <span id=Version_numbering class=mw-headline>Version numbering</span><span class=mw-editsection><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>[</span><a title=\"Edit section: Version numbering\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linux_kernel&action=edit&section=38\" target=_blank>edit</a><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The Linux kernel has had three different numbering schemes.</p>\n <p>The first scheme was used in the run-up to “1.0”. The first version of the kernel was 0.01. This was followed by 0.02, 0.03, 0.10, 0.11, 0.12 (the first GPL version), 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.98, 0.99 and then 1.0.<sup id=cite_ref-308 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-308 target=_blank>[306]</a></sup> From 0.95 on there were many patch releases between versions.</p>\n <p>After the 1.0 release and prior to version 2.6, the number was composed as “a.b.c”, where the number “a” denoted the kernel version, the number “b” denoted the major revision of the kernel, and the number “c” indicated the minor revision of the kernel. The kernel version was changed only when major changes in the code and the concept of the kernel occurred, twice in the history of the kernel: in 1994 (version 1.0) and in 1996 (version 2.0). Version 3.0 was released in 2011, but it was not a major change in kernel concept. The major revision was assigned according to the <a title=\"Software versioning\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Odd-numbered_versions_for_development_releases target=_blank>even–odd version numbering scheme</a>. The minor revision had been changed whenever security patches, bug fixes, new features or drivers were implemented in the kernel.</p>\n <p>In 2004, after version 2.6.0 was released, the kernel developers held several discussions regarding the release and version scheme<sup id=cite_ref-309 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-309 target=_blank>[307]</a></sup><sup id=cite_ref-310 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-310 target=_blank>[308]</a></sup> and ultimately Linus Torvalds and others decided that a much shorter “time-based” release cycle would be beneficial. For about seven years, the first two numbers remained “2.6”, and the third number was incremented with each new release, which rolled out after two to three months. A fourth number was sometimes added to account for bug and security fixes (only) to the kernel version. The even-odd system of alternation between stable and unstable was gone. Instead, development pre-releases are titled<a class=mw-redirect title=\"Release candidate\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_candidate target=_blank>release candidates</a>, which is indicated by appending the suffix ‘-rc’ to the kernel version, followed by an ordinal number.</p>\n <p>The first use of the fourth number occurred when a grave error, which required immediate fixing, was encountered in 2.6.8’s <a class=mw-redirect title=\"Network File System (protocol)\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_(protocol) target=_blank>NFS</a> code. However, there were not enough other changes to legitimize the release of a new minor revision (which would have been 2.6.9). So, 2.6.8.1 was released, with the only change being the fix of that error. With 2.6.11, this was adopted as the new official versioning policy. Later it became customary to continuously back-port major bug-fixes and security patches to released kernels and indicate that by updating the fourth number.</p>\n <p>On 29 May 2011, Linus Torvalds announced<sup id=cite_ref-311 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-311 target=_blank>[309]</a></sup> that the kernel version would be bumped to 3.0 for the release following 2.6.39, due to the minor version number getting too large and to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Linux. It continued the time-based release practice introduced with 2.6.0, but using the second number; for example, 3.1 would follow 3.0 after a few months. An additional number (now the third number) would be added on when necessary to designate security and bug fixes, as for example with 3.0.18; the Linux community refers to this as “3.x.y.z” versioning. The major version number was also later raised to 4, for the release following version 3.19.<sup id=cite_ref-312 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-312 target=_blank>[310]</a></sup><sup id=cite_ref-4.0-poll_280-1 class=reference><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#cite_note-4.0-poll-280 target=_blank>[b]</a></sup></p>\n <p>In addition to Linus’s “-rc” development releases, sometimes the version will have a suffix such as “tip”, indicating another <a title=\"Fork (software development)\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development) target=_blank>development branch</a>, usually (but not always) the initials of a person who made it. For example, “ck” stands for <a title=\"Con Kolivas\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Kolivas target=_blank>Con Kolivas</a>, “ac” stands for <a title=\"Alan Cox\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cox target=_blank>Alan Cox</a>, etc. Sometimes, the letters are related to the primary development area of the branch the kernel is built from, for example, “wl” indicates a wireless networking test build. Also, distributors may have their own suffixes with different numbering systems and for back-ports to their “enterprise” (i.e. stable but older) distribution versions.</p>\n <h3> <span id=Timeline class=mw-headline>Timeline</span><span class=mw-editsection><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>[</span><a title=\"Edit section: Timeline\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linux_kernel&action=edit&section=39\" target=_blank>edit</a><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>]</span></span> </h3> <div class=timeline-wrapper> <map name=timeline_4abf128fa895f28934a27ed2974c5859></map> <p><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/4abf128fa895f28934a27ed2974c5859.png\" usemap=#timeline_4abf128fa895f28934a27ed2974c5859></p>\n </div>\n <h3> <span id=Variants class=mw-headline>Variants</span><span class=mw-editsection><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>[</span><a title=\"Edit section: Variants\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linux_kernel&action=edit&section=40\" target=_blank>edit</a><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>]</span></span> </h3> <p>There are certain variants of the Linux kernel that provide additional functionality, but do not belong to the Linux kernel mainline.

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating “Yes, iteration is boring. But it’s also how Apple does business. […] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success”. He acknowledges that people are wishing for the “excitement of revolution”, but argues that people want “the comfort that comes with harmony”. Furthermore, he writes that “a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned”, referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that <a title=Walkman href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman target=_blank>Walkman</a> didn’t have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the <a title=ICloud href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud target=_blank>iCloud</a> cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an <a title=\"Apple Watch\" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch target=_blank>Apple Watch</a> can unlock a <a title=Macintosh href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh target=_blank>Mac</a> in close proximity).

This results in a significantly simpler programming environment (and eventually, portability to iOS), however only a very restricted set of Android APIs are available. The provided interfaces are focused on games. It is expected that the app will draw to the entire screen (via OpenGL, see the go.mobile/gl package), and that none of the platform’s screen management infrastructure is exposed. On Android, this means a native app is equivalent to a single Activity (in particular a NativeActivity) and on iOS, a single UIWindow. Touch events will be accessible via this package. When Android support is out of preview, all APIs supported by the Android NDK will be exposed via a Go package.</q></cite></span> </li>\n <li id=cite_note-76> <span class=mw-cite-backlink><b><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#cite_ref-76 target=_blank><span class=cite-accessibility-label>Jump up</span>^</a></b></span> <span class=reference-text><cite class=\"citation web\"><a class=\"external text\" href=http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/index.html rel=nofollow target=_blank>“Tools Overview”</a>. <i>Android Developers</i>.

Yasin did not want to leave his home in Samarra but his father said that it was best for the family because it was not safe to live there anymore and he wanted his son to grow up in a country that was accepting of all people. Yasin’s father told his son that England was a multicultural country where people lived and worked together regardless of race or religious beliefs.</p>\n <p><a href=http://www.worldstories.org.uk/video/player.swf target=_blank>http://www.worldstories.org.uk/video/player.swf</a></p>\n <p>Although Yasin was not happy about leaving Iraq, he soon settled into his new life in a big city called London. London was very exciting with its tall buildings and museums, and Yasin especially liked the London Planetarium and the big River Thames with all of its old bridges.</p>\n <p>Yasin even made friends with a boy who lived next door called Andrew. All summer long Andrew and Yasin played in the park or went to the zoo with Andrew’s mum. Andrew shared his toys and his comics with Yasin and told him all about his favourite superheroes. They even built a camp in Yasin’s back garden where they would hide from the grownups.</p>\n <p>The summer was a fun time and young Yasin soon felt quite at home in London even though it was a very big city and not nearly as sunny and hot as it was in Samarra. His English got better and better, especially with help from Andrew, although there were a lot of words that Yasin did not understand and he often felt silly because he could not speak as well as he would like.</p>\n <p>When September finally came around and the leaves began to fall from the trees, Yasin’s father explained that it was time for his son to go to school. Yasin was seven years old so he would be going to year three of the local primary school – the same year as his friend Andrew!</p>\n <p>Although Yasin was very nervous about going to school, his father and mother assured him that it would be a fun place where he would meet lots of new friends and learn lots of interesting new things. ‘English schools are supposed to be very good,’ said Yasin’s mother.</p>\n <p>‘And you will learn some very interesting things and your English will get better in no time,’ assured his father.</p>\n <p>Yasin was still not convinced, but when Andrew knocked on the door that morning with a big smile on his face saying how fun it was going to be at school, Yasin felt much better because he trusted his friend.</p>\n <p>The two boys chatted all the way to the school gates: Andrew told Yasin about the playground and who was the best teacher and what boys were the most fun and what girls were pretty and how they often served custard for pudding at lunchtimes. Yasin did not know what custard was, but Andrew looked very excited about it so Yasin thought it must taste very good.</p>\n <p>But when the boys got to their class, things did not go how Yasin imagined they would. The teacher told Andrew to take a seat at the front of the class as she introduced Yasin to the rest of the children. He did not like standing up in front of the class and one boy shouted out that he was a smelly foreigner. The boys and girls all laughed, and then another boy made fun of Yasin’s accent when he was asked to say his name and where he came from. ‘I can’t understand him, miss. He can’t even speak English,’ said the nasty boy.</p>\n <p>Finally Yasin was allowed to take a seat at the back of the class, but he wished that he was next to Andrew as he felt very alone. The girl sitting beside him kept looking at him in a strange way that made Yasin uncomfortable, and during the lesson she put her hand up and asked the teacher if she could move places. Yasin did not understand what he had done to offend the girl.</p>\n <p>When the bell went it was time to go out into the playground. All of the children closed their books and put on their coats and headed out of the door into the bright autumn sunshine. The teacher kept Yasin back for a moment and gave him a badge with his name on which she pinned to his jumper. ‘There you go,’ she said with a smile. ‘Now all of the children will be able to learn your name.’</p>\n <p>Yasin thought that the badge looked silly, and when he went out into the playground all of the children began pointing and laughing. ‘You’ve got a girl’s name,’ said a small boy with curly blond hair.</p>\n <p>Yasin wanted to explain that it was not a girl’s name but he was too nervous because all of the children were pointing at him and laughing. When Yasin got nervous his English was not very good and the words always got stuck in his throat. He was very sad and wanted to run out of the playground back to his mother and father and never return to school again. But just as he was about to run, he heard a familiar voice. ‘Hi Yasin.’ And when he looked up there was Andrew standing right beside him.</p>\n <p>Andrew looked at the children gathered around and shook his head. ‘What’s wrong with you lot?’ he asked. ‘I told my friend Yasin that school was fun. Why are you ruining it for him?’</p>\n <p>‘He’s different,’ said a very tall girl who was standing at the front of the crowd of children.</p>\n <p>‘So are you,’ said Andrew. ‘You are the tallest girl in the whole school and you don’t like it when people make fun of you, do you?’</p>\n <p>Then Andrew looked at the boy with the curly hair. ‘And you don’t like it when people say that you have girl’s hair,’ he said to the boy. ‘We are all different and that is what makes us interesting. What would life be like if we were all the same as one another?’</p>\n <p>There was silence among the children. Then Yasin lifted his head high. ‘Boring,’ he said with a smile.</p>\n <p>‘That’s right!’ exclaimed Andrew, returning his friend’s smile. ‘Flippin’ boring!’</p>\n <p>And with that all of the children began to laugh. ‘Flippin’ boring,’ they chanted at one another.</p>\n <p>Andrew went on to explain how he had spent the summer with Yasin, how they had built a camp together and played in the park, and how Yasin preferred Batman to Superman, and how he really was different because he didn’t even like hotdogs!<img class=img-right src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://i1.wp.com/www.worldstories.org.uk/images/story-images/English/glorious-differance-455x226.jpg\" alt width=455 height=226></p>\n <p>The children all laughed some more and soon everybody was talking about all the things that made them different from one another. Peter Jenkins even lifted up his jumper and showed everybody a big purple birthmark on the front of his belly. ‘Now that’s what I call different,’ he said triumphantly. ‘I bet none of you have a big birthmark like mine!’</p>\n <p>When break time was over, Andrew put his hand up in class and suggested to the teacher that they should spend the lesson talking about how great it was that everybody was so different from everybody else and how people came to England from all over the world to begin a new life like his friend Yasin. The teacher agreed that it was important to be an <em>individual</em>, and she also said how wonderful it was that the whole of Britain was such a <em>multicultural </em>island. Yasin wrote these two words down in his book and promised himself that he would learn them both and remember them always. He also wrote the word <em>friend </em>in his book. He already knew what friend meant, but he just wanted to write it down because he felt so lucky to have a good friend like Andrew who stood up for people and did not judge them just because they were different.</p>\n <p> </p>\n </div>\n <!-- .entry-content --> <footer class=entry-footer> <span class=byline><span class=\"author vcard\"><img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b66e3b1c33df9356e864c8cca3eaab3c?s=49&d=identicon&r=G\" class=\"avatar avatar-49\" height=49 width=49><span class=screen-reader-text>Author </span> <a class=\"url fn n\" href=https://gsmph.wordpress.com/author/jersnet/ target=_blank>jersnet</a></span></span><span class=posted-on><span class=screen-reader-text>Posted on </span><a href=https://gsmph.wordpress.com/2016/12/27/a-good-frnds/ rel=bookmark target=_blank><time class=\"entry-date published updated\" datetime=2016-12-27T08:32:35+00:00>December 27, 2016</time></a></span><span class=comments-link><a href=https://gsmph.wordpress.com/2016/12/27/a-good-frnds/#respond target=_blank>Leave a comment<span class=screen-reader-text> on a good frnds</span></a></span> </footer><!-- .entry-footer --> </article><!-- #post-## --> <article id=post-40 class=\"post-40 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized\"> <header class=entry-header> <h2 class=entry-title><a href=https://gsmph.wordpress.com/2016/12/27/half-a-year-in-gra-bretanha/ rel=bookmark target=_blank>Half a Year in Grã-Bretanha</a></h2> </header><!-- .entry-header --> <div class=entry-content> <p><strong>January</strong></p>\n <p>‘Why does it always rain here?’ Natalia asked her mother.</p>\n <p>Natalia’s mother looked up from her newspaper in surprise. ‘It rains in Brazil too,’ she said. ‘Don’t you remember? It’s summer there now but it will rain in the winter.’</p>\n <p>Natalia shivered and looked out of the window at the rainy streets of England. She could no more imagine going outside in a swimming costume right now than going to the moon. She looked back at the computer on the little desk in the library. The screen was showing half a dozen photos of her friend Rita on the beach. Rita looked tanned and happy and Natalia felt a pang of jealousy.</p>\n <p>‘It’s nearly time to go,’ said Mamãe. ‘The library is closing. Finish your email and then let’s get home.’</p>\n <p>Natalia took her seat at the computer and finished off the email to her friend Rita:</p>\n <p><em>I miss everyone in Rio, especially you! It’s cold and rainy here. Your photos are cool.</em></p>\n <p><em>Love Natalia xxx</em></p>\n <p><strong>February</strong></p>\n <p>February soon followed January, and it wasn’t long before Natalia received news from her friend Rita once more...</p>\n <p><em>Hi Natalia,</em></p>\n <p><em>It’s so hot here! We are all getting ready for Carnival. I am getting my costume ready and uncle Rufino is playing tambourim in the Samba School again. It’s getting so close! Wish you were here.</em></p>\n <p><em>Rita xx</em></p>\n <p>‘Carnival,’ Natalia sighed to herself. It was the best time of year in Rio de Janeiro. ‘I wish I was back in Brazil now,’ she thought as she typed away at the computer in the library...</p>\n <p><em>Hi Rita,</em></p>\n <p><em>Thanks for your photos! </em><em>Tomorrow I’m going to my friend Emma’s house to make pancakes for Shrove Tuesday. We’ll have sugar and lemon on them but it won’t be the same as Carnival. It is still cold here and it seems to rain all the time!</em></p>\n <p><em>Natalia xxxxx</em></p>\n <p>As Natalia and Mamãe walked home through the dark and rainy streets, the young girl listened to the rain splashing from the car tyres travelling up and down the road beside her. She imitated the sound of the rain to cheer herself up... ‘<em>Schwoosh, schwoosh, schwoosh, schwoosh!’ </em>Then she began stamping her foot on the wet pavement... <em>Splat, splat, splat, splat.</em> And over the top of the schwooshing and splatting noises, Natalia imagined she could hear the distinctive samba rhythm that she remembered hearing everywhere in Rio, played on caxixi shakers and other beautiful instruments. <em>Chuki-chuk, paf! chuki-chuki, paf! chuki-chuki, paf! chuki-chuki, paf!</em></p>\n <p>And so Natalia cheered herself up in the rain by <em>schwooshing and splatting and chuki-chuki paffing </em>all the way home.</p>\n <p><strong>March</strong></p>\n <p><em>Hi Natalia!</em></p>\n <p><em>How is England? Today we went to the beach and we were one short for volleyball. You are the best of our cousins at volleyball and so we all missed you very much!</em></p>\n <p><em>It’s really hot here still. I am drinking a lot of coconut water to keep cool! I took a photo for you so you won’t forget!</em></p>\n <p><em>Love Rita xxxx</em></p>\n <p><em>Hi Rita,</em></p>\n <p><em>I miss coconut water! And açai juice with granola. But most of all I miss cupuaçu juice! I wish we had cupuaçu here. We have peaches and melon but nothing tastes as good as back home.</em></p>\n <p><em>Natalia xxxxx</em></p>\n <p><strong>April</strong></p>\n <p>Spring was beginning to break in England as Natalia sat with her friend Emma at the computer screen during after school club.</p>\n <p>‘Look at this, Emma!’ Natalia exclaimed in excitement. ‘Rita has sent me some photos of Botafogo playing against Fluminese.’</p>\n <p>Emma moved closer to the screen so that she could get a better look at the pictures of men running about in their colourful sports clothes. ‘Who are they?’ she asked.</p>\n <p>‘They are Rio football teams,’ Natalia replied, unable to disguise the excitement in her voice. ‘Football in Brazil is so good! I wish I could take you to a match so that you could see for yourself. They have samba bands playing in the terraces, and whenever there is a goal scored the crowd goes crazy! The bands play so loudly and everyone chants and sings. It’s like a big party. Look, I’ll show you!’</p>\n <p>Natalia searched on the internet and found a video of a Brazilian football match so that she could show Emma. It was very loud and full of colour with the big surdo drum beating out a rhythm loudest of all... <em>Ba-boom, boom, boom! Ba-boom, boom, boom! Ba-boom, boom, boom!</em></p>\n <p>The two girls searched for more videos of football games in Rio. They watched the city come to life through the screen: the sounds flowed out into the darkening classroom while the colours flickered and danced on the walls. Natalia tried to imagine that she was back home in Aunt Susana and Uncle Feliciano’s apartment on the hill, in the room she shared with Rita and her other cousins Alicia and Marina. The room was always warm and the girls always had fun looking out over the city at night. Suddenly Natalia felt very far away from home and this made her quite sad.</p>\n <p><strong>June</strong></p>\n <p>The seasons had changed from spring to early summer, and a milky pale sunshine often woke Natalia by shining through the curtains of her bedroom window in the early morning. Unlike Rio, it was a gentle heat that made everything shimmer. The flowerbeds in the park near the school buzzed with insects, bees went about collecting nectar to make honey, and Natalia noticed how everybody seemed to be smiling more now that the sun was out.</p>\n <p><em>Dear Rita,</em></p>\n <p><em>Today Emma and I played tennis at school. It’s really fun! It’s Wimbledon here so lots of people are excited about the tennis. We got to watch it at school and had strawberries and cream. It was really fun. It is finally sunny here and really quite beautiful!</em></p>\n <p><em>Xxx</em></p>\n <p><em>Hi Natalia,</em></p>\n <p><em>We have tennis here too, remember? But I don’t like playing when it’s too hot. Sounds like you are having fun in England but here it is even more fun!</em></p>\n <p><em>Here are some photos of João and me when we went on a school trip to the Botanical Gardens.</em></p>\n <p><em>Xxxx</em></p>\n <p>When Natalia read this latest email she could not help being annoyed with her friend Rita. It seemed that Rita was always saying how much better things were in Brazil, even though she must know that Natalia missed her home very much. In the end, the two friends ended up arguing and decided not to write to each other for a while. Natalia realised then more than ever how difficult it was being away from home and adjusting to a new country, and she was disappointed that her friend Rita was so unsympathetic.</p>\n <p><strong><img title=\"Feet in Sea\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://i1.wp.com/www.worldstories.org.uk/images/Half-a-Year-in-GB----Rio.jpeg\" alt=\"Feet in Sea\" width=320 height=158></strong></p>\n <p><strong>July</strong></p>\n <p>It was a hot summer, school was over and Natalia found herself all alone. Emma had gone to visit her grandma in Scotland and Mamãe was at work all the time. Natalia was bored and missed home very much. She was tired of watching the same shows on television: the ones with stupid people dressed up as furry monsters always singing silly songs. She was even bored of drawing. All she could ever think to draw was the beach in Rio with people sitting under parasols drinking coconut water, or playing volleyball, or surfing in the warm sea. It made her sad.</p>\n <p>Mamãe had shown Natalia how to lock the front door so that she could walk herself to the library when she wanted to. This made Natalia feel very grownup, but each time she walked to the library and logged on to the computer, she was always disappointed to find that she had no emails from her friend Rita. Natalia was very upset that they had argued and she missed hearing news from home.</p>\n <p>But one day there was an email, not from Rita but from Natalia’s English friend Emma....</p>\n <p><em>Hi Natalia,</em></p>\n <p><em>How are you? My mum asked me if you might want to come and stay with my grandma and me next month? My grandma is very old but very nice, and Scotland is fun.</em></p>\n <p><em>Love Emma xxx</em></p>\n <p>Natalia could not believe her luck! She ran home and waited for her mother to return from work so that she could ask to go to Scotland.</p>\n <p><strong>August</strong></p>\n <p>Scotland was so different from London! Emma’s grandma lived by the sea in a tiny village. In the evenings it stayed light for a long time and they went down to the beach. There were raspberries growing in the hedgerows so that you could pick them and eat them any time you wanted to. Natalia had never seen them growing wild before and was amazed when Emma picked them straight from the bushes for the first time.</p>\n <p>And on the first day Natalia saw something even more exciting than wild raspberries... The sea!</p>\n <p>‘The sea, the sea!’ she exclaimed. ‘Let’s put our toes in the water!’ And before Emma could stop her, Natalia threw off her shoes and ran towards the waves. But when the clear blue water swirled around her ankles, Natalia shrieked in surprise.</p>\n <p>‘It’s so cold!’ she cried out to Emma.</p>\n <p>‘I tried to tell you!’ Emma laughed, ‘but you ran in too quickly! It’s not like Rio. The water is very cold here in Scotland.’</p>\n <p>They skipped in and out of the surf and watched the waves crashing against the rocks until their toes were numb with cold. Natalia felt happy for the first time in ages and she remembered playing on the beach with Rita and João and the other cousins back home. She saw a tiny boat tied to a little wooden jetty further along the beach and the young girl thought to herself: ‘We could sail all the way round the coast of Scotland and across the Atlantic Ocean in that little boat. We would pass America and Mexico, and then the water would begin to get warmer and warmer until eventually we would wash up on the shore in Rio!’</p>\n <p>Natalia imagined how everyone would be so pleased to see them and they would have cupuaçu and açai juice and eat feijoada and moqueca. There would be a band playing to welcome them just like the celebrations when a goal is scored on the pitch for Botafogo...<em>Schwoosh, schwoosh, splat splat, chuki-chuki-paf, chuki-chuki-paf!</em></p>\n <p>Natalia and Emma played all day long until the sun began to fade. They talked about the differences between England and Scotland and Rio. They explored and walked, and they chased each other up and down the beach until they were exhausted. Then, when evening had set in and there was a cold chill in the air, the two friends headed home for dinner.</p>\n <p>That night, curled up in bed in Emma’s grandma’s little cottage on the coast, Natalia thought how lucky she was to be able to experience other cultures and to make new friends so far away from home. ‘England may be wet,’ she thought, ‘and the sea in Scotland in very cold, but there is always something to appreciate in a new culture, always something to admire and something to learn.’</p>\n <p>Before she went to sleep that night, Natalia promised herself that she would write to Rita and say sorry for their silly argument and tell her all about Scotland and the little cottage on the coast, and how she was even hoping that it might snow in England that winter.
