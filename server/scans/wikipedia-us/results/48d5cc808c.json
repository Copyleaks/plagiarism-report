With a population of over 327 million people, the U.S. is the third most populous country. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York City. Most of the country is located contiguously in North America between Canada and Mexico. \n Paleo-Indiansmigrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago.European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Following the French and Indian War, numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775, and the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories,displacing Native American tribes, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848.\n During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery. By the end of the century, the United States had reached the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Sweeping civil rights legislation passed under President Lyndon B. Johnson, notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, outlawed discrimination based on race or color and established the country as a full liberal democracy. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the 1969 U.S. Moon landing. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.\n The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a federal republic and a representative democracy. The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The U.S. economy is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world.[30] The United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter of goods, by value.[31] Although its population is only 4.3% of the world total,[33] the U.S. holds 31% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country.[34]\n Despite income and wealth disparities, the United States continues to rank very high in measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, median income (both before and after taxes and transfers), human development, per capita GDP, and worker productivity.[35][36] The United States is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending,[37] and is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[38]\n Contents\n\n Etymology See also: Naming of the Americas, Names for United States citizens, and American (word) \n  The Americas are believed to be named for the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci.[39] \n \n\n In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere America in honor of the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin: Americus Vespucius).[40] The first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., to George Washington's aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army, Lt. Col. Joseph Reed. Moylan expressed his wish to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort.[41][43] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[44]\n The second draft of the Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared \"The name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America'\".[45] The final version of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence \"The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'\".[46] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his \"original Rough draught\" of the Declaration of Independence.[45] This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.[45]\n The short form \"United States\" is also standard. Other common forms are the \"U.S.\", the \"USA\", and \"America\". Colloquial names are the \"U.S. of A.\" and, internationally, the \"States\". \"Columbia\", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the name \"District of Columbia\", many landmarks and institutions in the Western Hemisphere bear his name, including the country of Colombia.[47]\n The phrase \"United States\" was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., \"the United States are\"—including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865.[48] The singular form—e.g., \"the United States is\"—became popular after the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom \"these United States\". The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.[49]\n A citizen of the United States is an \"American\". \"United States\", \"American\" and \"U.S.\" refer to the country adjectivally (\"American values\", \"U.S. forces\"). In English, the word \"American\" rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States.[50]\n History Main articles: History of the United States, Timeline of United States history, American business history, Economic history of the United States, and Labor history of the United States \n Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history Further information: Native Americans in the United States \n   \n  Monks Mound, in Cahokia, a UNESCOWorld Heritage Site \n \n  \n The Cliff Palace, built by the Ancestral Puebloans \n \n \n\n\n It has been generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[51] After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward along the Pacific coast[53] and through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets.[54] The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas.[55] The Clovis culture was believed to represent the first human settlement of the Americas.[56] Over the years, more and more evidence has advanced the idea of \"pre-Clovis\" cultures including tools dating back about 15,550 years ago. It is likely these represent the first of three major waves of migrations into North America.[57]\n Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-ColumbianMississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies.[58] The Mississippian culture flourished in the south from 800 to 1600 AD, extending from the Mexican border down through Florida.[59] Its city state Cahokia is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States.[60] In the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloans culture developed as the culmination of centuries of agricultural experimentation, which produced greater dependence on farming.[61] Three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United States are credited to the Pueblos: Mesa Verde National Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, and Taos Pueblo.[63] The earthworks constructed by Native Americans of the Poverty Point culture in northeastern Louisiana have also been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.[64]\n The date of the first settlements of the Hawaiian Islands is a topic of continuing debate.[65]Archaeological evidence seems to indicate a settlement as early as 124 AD.[66]\n Effects on and interaction with native populations Further information: American Indian Wars, Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas, and Native American disease and epidemics \n With the progress of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced.[67] The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles.[68][69]\n While estimating the original native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult, an attempt was made in the early part of the twentieth century by James Mooney using historic records to estimate the indigenous population north of Mexico in 1600.[70][71] In more recent years, Douglas H. Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution has updated these figures. While Ubelaker estimated that there was a population of 92,916 in the south Atlantic states and a population of 473,616 in the Gulf states, most academics regard the figure as too low.[70]AnthropologistHenry F. Dobyns believed that the populations were much higher, suggesting 1,100,000 along the shores of the gulf of Mexico, 2,211,000 people living between Florida and Massachusetts, 5,250,000 in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries and 697,000 people in the Florida peninsula.[70][71]\n The first interaction between Europeans and Native Americans was made by the Norsemen. A number of surviving Norse sagas provide information regarding The Maritimes and its indigenous people. The Norse attempted to settle in North America about 500 years before Columbus.[73][74][75]\n In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.[76] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans, and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.[77][78]\n European settlements Further information: Colonial history of the United States, European colonization of the Americas, and Thirteen Colonies \n   St. Augustine, Florida, the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States (1565)[79] \n \n\n   The Mayflower Compact, 1620 by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris \n \n\n With the advancement of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced.[80] The first Europeans to arrive in the territory of the modern United States were Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made his first visit to Florida in 1513; however, if unincorporated territories are accounted for, then credit would go to Christopher Columbus who landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage. The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine[79] and Santa Fe. The French established their own as well along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims'Plymouth Colony in 1620. Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[81]\n Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice, and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period, Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply.[83] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.[84]\n A large-scale slave trade with English privateers was begun.[85] The life expectancy of slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves.[86][87] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.[88][89] But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.[90]\n With the British colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America were established.[91] All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism. With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.[93] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.[94]\n  The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748\n \n\n During the Seven Years' War (in the United States, known as the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[95] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.[96]\n In 1774, the Spanish Navy ship Santiago, under Juan Pérez, entered and anchored in an inlet of Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, in present-day British Columbia. Although the Spanish did not land, natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from California.[97] At the time, the Spanish were able to monopolize the trade between Asia and North America, granting limited licenses to the Portuguese. When the Russians began establishing a growing fur trading system in Alaska, the Spanish began to challenge the Russians, with Pérez's voyage being the first of many to the Pacific Northwest.[98][j]\n During his third and final voyage, Captain James Cook became the first European to begin formal contact with Hawaii.[100] Captain Cook's last voyage included sailing along the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months.[101]\n Independence and expansion (1776–1865) Further information: American Revolutionary War, United States Declaration of Independence, American Revolution, and Territorial evolution of the United States \n   Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull \n \n\n The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of \"republicanism\" asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen and \"no taxation without representation\". The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.\n The Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, which recognized, in a long preamble, that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great Britain, and declared, in the words of the resolution, that the thirteen United Colonies formed an independent nation and had no further allegiance to the British crown. The fourth day of July is celebrated annually as Independence Day.[103] The Second Continental Congress declared on September 9 \"where, heretofore, the words 'United Colonies' have been used, the stile be altered for the future to the 'United States' \".[104] In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789.[103]\n   U.S. territorial acquisitions–portions of each territory were granted statehood since the 18th century.\n \n\n Following the defeat at Yorktown in 1781,[105] Britain signed the peace treaty of 1783, and American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[106]\n Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population.[107][108][109] The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[110] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[111]\n  Map of the states and territories of the United States, c. 1834\n \n\n Americans' eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's area.[113] The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism.[114] A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[115] The expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&amp;M; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.[116]\n From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider white male suffrage; it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny.[117] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[118] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[119]\n  The national mammal, an American bison in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming\n \n\n The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration, the California Genocide and the creation of additional western states. After the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, the loss of the American bison (sometimes called \"buffalo\") was an existential blow to many Plains Indians culture. In 1869, a new Peace Policy nominally promised to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship. Nonetheless, large-scale conflicts continued throughout the West into the 1900s. \n Civil War and Reconstruction era Further information: American Civil War and Reconstruction era \n   The Battle of Gettysburg by Thure de Thulstrup \n \n\n Differences of opinion regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union had alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.\n With the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the \"South\"), while the federal government (the \"Union\") maintained that secession was illegal. In order to bring about this secession, military action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind. The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians. The South fought for the freedom to own slaves, while the Union at first simply fought to maintain the country as one united whole. Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibited slavery. \n Three amendments were added to the U.S. Constitution in the years after the war: the aforementioned Thirteenth as well as the Fourteenth Amendment providing citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,[130] and the Fifteenth Amendment ensuring in theory that African Americans had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power[131] aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the South while guaranteeing the rights of the newly freed slaves. \n Reconstruction began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, an assassin's bullet on April 14, 1865, drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the Compromise of 1877 when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the presidential election of 1876. \n Southern white Democrats, calling themselves \"Redeemers\", took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction. From 1890 to 1910, so-called Jim Crow lawsdisenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region. Blacks faced racial segregation, especially in the South. They also occasionally experienced vigilante violence, including lynching.[133]\n   Ellis Island, in New York City, was a major gateway for European immigration.[134] \n \n\n  The Statue of Liberty in New York City, dedicated in 1886, is a symbol of the United States as well as its ideals of freedom, democracy, and justice.[135] \n \n\n Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization Main articles: Economic history of the United States and Technological and industrial history of the United States \n In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture.[136] National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.[137]\n The United States fought Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River from 1810 to at least 1890.[138] Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and the confinement of the latter to Indian reservations. This further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets.[139] Mainland expansion also included the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[140] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War.[141]American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War. The United States purchased the U.S. Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917.[143]\n Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest, and the United States achieved great power status.[144] These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[145] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.[146][147][148]\n World War I, Great Depression, and World War II Further information: World War I, Great Depression, and World War II \n  The Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world when completed in 1931, during the Great Depression.\n \n\n The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until 1917, when it joined the war as an \"associated power\", alongside the formal Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[149]\n In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage.[150] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television.[151] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system. The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s;[153] whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[154]\n At first effectively neutral during World War II while Germany conquered much of continental Europe, the United States began supplying material to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers.[155] Although Japan attacked the United States first, the U.S. nonetheless pursued a \"Europe first\" defense policy.[156] The United States thus left its vast Asian colony, the Philippines, isolated and fighting a losing struggle against Japanese invasion and occupation, as military resources were devoted to the European theater. During the war, the United States was referred to as one of the \"Four Policemen\"[157] of Allies power who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union and China.[158][159] Although the nation lost around 400,000 military personnel,[160] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[161]\n  The Trinity test of the Manhattan Project was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon \n \n\n The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences with the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and other Allies, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe's postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war. The United States and Japan then fought each other in the largest naval battle in history in terms of gross tonnage sunk, the Battle of Leyte Gulf.[163][164] The United States eventually developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; causing the Japanese to surrender on September 2, ending World War II.[165][166] Parades and celebrations followed in what is known as Victory Day, or V-J Day.[167]\n Cold War and civil rights era Main articles: History of the United States (1945–1964), History of the United States (1964–1980), and History of the United States (1980–1991) \n Further information: Cold War, Civil Rights Movement, War on Poverty, Space Race, and Reaganomics \n   Martin Luther King, Jr. speaking to an anti-Vietnam War rally at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul on April 27, 1967\n \n\n  U.S. president Ronald Reagan (left) and Soviet general secretaryMikhail Gorbachev, meeting in Geneva in 1985\n \n\n After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what became known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism[168] and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict. \n The United States often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored, and occasionally pursued direct action for regime change against left-wing governments.[169] American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–53.[170] The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a \"Space Race\" in which the United States became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969.[170] A proxy war in Southeast Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War. \n At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[171] In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state added to the country.[173] The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination.[174][175][176] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution. \n The launch of a \"War on Poverty\" expanded entitlements and welfare spending, including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that provide health coverage to the elderly and poor, respectively, and the means-testedFood Stamp Program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.[177]\n The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned \"containment\" and initiated the more aggressive \"rollback\" strategy towards the USSR.[178][179][180][181] After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[183]\n The late 1980s brought a \"thaw\" in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.[184][185][186][187] This brought about unipolarity[188] with the U.S. unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower. The concept of Pax Americana, which had appeared in the post-World War II period, gained wide popularity as a term for the post-Cold War new world order.\n Contemporary history Main articles: History of the United States (1991–2008) and History of the United States (2008–present) \n Further information: Gulf War, September 11 attacks, War on Terror, 2008 financial crisis, and Affordable Care Act \n   \n The World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan during the September 11terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda in 2001\n \n  \n  One World Trade Center, newly built in its place\n \n \n\n\n After the Cold War, the conflict in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Saddam Husseininvaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H. W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.[189]\n Originating in U.S. defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic networks, and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the global economy, society, and culture.[190]\n Due to the dot-com boom, stable monetary policy under Alan Greenspan, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.[191] Beginning in 1994, the U.S. entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade among the three partners has soared since NAFTA went into force.\n On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[193] In response, the United States launched the War on Terror, which included war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.[194][195] In 2007, the Bush administration ordered a major troop surge in the Iraq War,[196] which successfully reduced violence and led to greater stability in the region.[197][198]\n Government policy designed to promote affordable housing,[199] widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation's history since the Great Depression.Barack Obama, the first African-American and multiracial president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements and a relative decline in unemployment. Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there has been debate about its effects on the economy.\n American forces in Iraq were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and the war in the region was declared formally over in December 2011. The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency, leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region. In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time since 1961.[needs update] The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran's nuclear program, though the U.S. withdrew from the deal in May 2018. In the United States presidential election of 2016, Republican Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States. Trump is both the oldest and wealthiest person elected president in United States history.\n Geography, climate, and environment Main articles: Geography of the United States, Climate of the United States, and Environment of the United States \n  A composite satellite image of the contiguous United States and surrounding areas\n \n\n  Köppen climate classifications\n \n\n The land area of the entire United States is approximately 3,800,000 square miles (9,841,955 km2), with the contiguous United States making up 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940.6 km2) of that. Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856.2 km2). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. The populated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2). Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.\n The United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured.[d] The Encyclopædia Britannica, for instance, lists the size of the United States as 3,677,649 square miles (9,525,067 km2), as they do not count the country's coastal or territorial waters.The World Factbook, which includes those waters, gives 3,796,742 square miles (9,833,517 km2).\n The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont. The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest. The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.\n  Highest peak in the country, Denali \n \n\n The Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado. Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave. The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California, and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart. At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali (Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and North America. Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature. The United States has the most ecoregions out of any country in the world.\n The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.\n Wildlife Main articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States \n See also: Category:Biota of the United States \n  The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782.\n \n\n The U.S. ecology is megadiverse: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland. The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species. About 91,000 insect species have been described. The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself.\n There are 59 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas. Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country's land area. Most of this is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; about .86% is used for military purposes.\n Environmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n Demographics Main articles: Americans, Demography of the United States, and Race and ethnicity in the United States \n Population See also: List of U.S. states by population and List of United States cities by population \n  Historical population   Census Pop. %±   1790 3,929,214  —   1800 5,308,483  35.1%   1810 7,239,881  36.4%    9,638,453  33.1%   1830 12,866,020  33.5%   1840 17,069,453  32.7%   1850 23,191,876  35.9%   1860 31,443,321  35.6%   1870 38,558,371  22.6%   1880 50,189,209  30.2%   1890 62,979,766  25.5%   1900 76,212,168  21.0%   1910 92,228,496  21.0%    106,021,537  15.0%   1930 123,202,624  16.2%   1940 132,164,569  7.3%   1950 151,325,798  14.5%   1960 179,323,175  18.5%   1970 203,211,926  13.3%   1980 226,545,805  11.5%   1990 248,709,873  9.8%    281,421,906  13.2%    308,745,538  9.7%   Est. 2018[9] 327,167,434  6.0%  1610–1780 population data.\nNote that the census numbers do\nnot include Native Americans until 1860.  The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the country's population to be 327,167,434 as of July 1, 2018, and to be adding 1 person (net gain) every 13 seconds, or about 6,646 people per day.[33] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from 76.2 million in 1900 to 281.4 million in 2000. The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected. In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children; by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56. Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.76 children per woman in 2017. Foreign-born immigration has caused the U.S. population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign-born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 45 million in 2015, representing one-third of the population increase. In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants (second-generation Americans) in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population. The United States has a very diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.German Americans are the largest ethnic group (more than 50 million) – followed by Irish Americans (circa 37 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans (circa 28 million).\n White Americans (mostly European ancestry group with 73.1% of total population) are the largest racial group; black Americans are the nation's largest racial minority (note that in the U.S. Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans are counted as an ethnic group, not a \"racial\" group), and third-largest ancestry group.Asian Americans are the country's second-largest racial minority; the three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans. According to a 2015 survey, the largest American community with European ancestry is German Americans, which consists of more than 14% of the total population. In 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively). The census counted more than 19 million people of \"Some Other Race\" who were \"unable to identify with any\" of its five official race categories in 2010, over 18.5 million (97%) of whom are of Hispanic ethnicity.\n  Most common ancestry in each U.S. state in 2000\nGermanAmericanMexicanIrishAfricanItalianEnglishJapanesePuerto Rican \n \n\n The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend. The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent are identified as sharing a distinct \"ethnicity\" by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent. Between 2000 and 2010, the country's Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%. Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[k]\n The drop in the U.S. fertility rate from 2.08 per woman in 2007 to 1.76 in 2017 was mostly due to the declining birth rate of Hispanics, teenagers, and young women, although the birth rate for older women rose, below the replacement rate of 2.1. In 2018 the median age of the United States population was 38.1 years.\n Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 37.2% of the population in 2012 and over 50% of children under age one, and are projected to constitute the majority by 2044.\n The United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world average. Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher than that of many developed nations. In fiscal year 2017, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.Mexico has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries since the 1990s. As of 2012, approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal immigrants. As of 2015, 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing. The estimated number of illegal immigrants dropped to 10.7 million in 2017, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. In 2017, 33,000 refugees were resettled in the United States. This was fewer than were resettled in the rest of the world for the first time in decades. A 2017 Gallup poll concluded that 4.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT with 5.1% of women identifying as LGBT, compared with 3.9% of men. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%.\n Major population areas The U.S. Census Bureau numerically ranks population areas by city, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), and larger combined statistical areas (CSAs). \n About 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs); about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston). There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million. Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South. The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008.\n In addition to official census groupings based on the aforementioned city, MSA and CSA level, clusters of American cities can also be known as megaregions: the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. \n Language Main article: Languages of the United States \n See also: Language Spoken at Home in the United States of America, List of endangered languages in the United States, and Language education in the United States \n English (American English) is the de factonational language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in 32 states.\n Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state law.Alaska recognizes twenty Native languages as well as English. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms.\n Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan[300] is officially recognized by American Samoa. Chamorro[301] is an official language of Guam. Both Carolinian and Chamorro have official recognition in the Northern Mariana Islands. Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there.[303]\n The most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate education, are: Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners) include Latin, Japanese, ASL, Italian, and Chinese.[304][305] 18% of all Americans claim to speak at least one language in addition to English.[306]\n  Languages spoken at home by more than 1 million persons in the U.S. (2016)[307][308][l]    Language Percent of\npopulation Number of\nspeakers Number who\nspeak English\nvery well Number who\nspeak English\nless than\nvery well     English(only)  ~80% 237,810,023 N/A N/A     Spanish\n(including Spanish Creole but excluding Puerto Rico)  13% 40,489,813 23,899,421 16,590,392     Chinese\n(all varieties, including Mandarin and Cantonese)  1.0% 3,372,930 1,518,619 1,854,311     Tagalog\n(including Filipino)  0.5% 1,701,960 1,159,211 542,749    Vietnamese 0.4% 1,509,993 634,273 875,720     Arabic\n(all varieties)  0.3% 1,231,098 770,882 460,216     French\n(including Patois and Cajun)  0.3% 1,216,668 965,584 251,087    Korean 0.2% 1,088,788 505,734 583,054     Religion Main article: Religion in the United States \n  Religious affiliation in the U.S. (2014)[309]    Affiliation  % of U.S. population    Christianity 70.6    Protestant 46.5    Evangelical Protestant 25.4    Mainline Protestant 14.7    Black church 6.5    Catholic 20.8    Mormon 1.6    Jehovah's Witnesses 0.8    Eastern Orthodox 0.5    Other Christian  0.4    Judaism 1.9    Hinduism 1.2    Islam 0.9    Buddhism 0.9    Other faiths  1.8    Irreligion 22.8    Nothing in particular  15.8    Agnostic 4.0    Atheist 3.1    Don't know or refused answer  0.6     The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment. \n In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a \"very important role in their lives\", a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.[310] In a 2009 Gallup poll, 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.[311]\n As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30. Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion has been declining since the mid to late 1980s,[313] and that younger Americans, in particular, are becoming increasingly irreligious.[309][314] According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time.[315][316] Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.[317]\n According to a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults in the United States identified themselves as Christians;[318]Protestants accounted for 46.5%, while Roman Catholics, at 20.8%, formed the largest single denomination.[319] In 2014, 5.9% of the U.S. adult population claimed a non-Christian religion.[309] These include Judaism (1.9%), Hinduism (1.2%), Buddhism (0.9%), and Islam (0.9%).[309] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion—up from 8.2% in 1990.[319] There are also Unitarian Universalist, Scientologist, Baha'i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Satanist, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.\n Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States, accounting for almost half of all Americans. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism at 15.4%, and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination at 5.3% of the U.S. population. Apart from Baptists, other Protestant categories include nondenominational Protestants, Methodists, Pentecostals, unspecified Protestants, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, other Reformed, Episcopalians/Anglicans, Quakers, Adventists, Holiness, Christian fundamentalists, Anabaptists, Pietists, and multiple others. Two-thirds of American Protestants consider themselves to be born again.Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin primarily in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas, as well as in the English colony of Maryland. It later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island has the highest percentage of Catholics, with 40 percent of the total population.Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.Eastern Orthodoxy is claimed by 5% of people in Alaska, a former Russian colony, and maintains a presence on the U.S. mainland due to recent immigration from Eastern Europe. Finally, a number of other Christian groups are active across the country, including the Oneness Pentecostals, Jehovah's Witnesses, Restorationists, Churches of Christ, Christian Scientists, Unitarians and many others. \n The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.[311]\n Family structure Main article: Family structure in the United States \n As of 2007, 58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 25% had never been married. Women now work mostly outside the home and receive a majority of bachelor's degrees.[330]\n The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991.[331] In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, and the lowest in Wyoming.[331]Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[333] In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.[334]\n The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2016 was 1.82 births per 1000 woman.[335]Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).[336] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[337]Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide, owing to the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, and it is legal for same-sex couples to adopt.Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[338]\n Health See also: Health care in the United States, Health care reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States \n  View of the Texas Medical Center from Fannin Street. The center is the largest medical complex in the world.\n \n\n The United States had a life expectancy of 78.6 years at birth in 2017, which was the third year of declines in life expectancy following decades of continuous increase. The recent decline is largely due to sharp increases in the drug overdose and suicide rates. Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among blacks.[339][340] According to CDC and Census Bureau data, deaths from suicide, alcohol and drug overdoses hit record highs in 2017.[341]\n Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 11th in the world in 1987, to 42nd in 2007. Obesity rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years, are the highest in the industrialized world, and are among the highest anywhere.[343][344] Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight.[345] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.[346]\n In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[347] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[348]\n The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the European Union and Switzerland together contributed to five.[349] Since 1966, more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.[350] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.[351]\n Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2017, 12.2% of the population did not carry health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[353][354] In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[355]Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014,[needs update] though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.[356][357]\n Education Main article: Education in the United States \n  The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of the many public universities in the United States. Universal government-funded education exists in the United States, while there are also many privately funded institutions.\n \n\n American public education is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[358]\n About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarianprivate schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[359] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student.[360] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[361]\n Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees. The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.[363] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[364]\n Higher education Main article: Higher education in the United States \n The United States has many competitive private and public institutions of higher education. The majority of the world's top universities listed by different ranking organizations are in the U.S.[365][366][367] There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[citation needed]\n As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[360][369] As of 2018, student loan debt exceeded 1.5 trillion dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards.[370][371]\n Government and politics Main articles: Federal government of the United States, Politics of the United States, State governments of the United States, and Local government in the United States \n   \n The United States Capitol,\nwhere Congress meets:\nthe Senate, left; the House, right\n \n\n  \n The White House, home and workplace of the U.S. President \n \n\n  \n  Supreme Court Building, where the nation's highest court sits\n \n\n \n\n The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a representative democracy, \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law\". The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.[373] For 2018, the U.S. ranked 25th on the Democracy Index[374] and 22nd on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[375]\n In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is rare at lower levels.[376]\n The federal government comprises three branches: \n The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census, seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, had 53.[381] The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories each have one member of Congress — these members are not allowed to vote.\n The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one-third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories do not have senators. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The president is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[383] The Supreme Court, led by the chief justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[384]\n The state governments are structured in a roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature.[385] The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote. \n The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the \"great writ\" of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[386] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[387] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[388]\n Political divisions Main articles: Political divisions of the United States, U.S. state, Territories of the United States, List of states and territories of the United States, and Indian reservation \n Further information: Territorial evolution of the United States and United States territorial acquisitions \n  Map of U.S. Economic Exclusion Zone,[389] highlighting states, territories and possessions\n \n\n The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[390][391] The states and territories are the principal administrative districts in the country. These are divided into subdivisions of counties and independent cities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C.[393] The states and the District of Columbia choose the president of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their representatives and senators in Congress; the District of Columbia has three (because of the 23rd Amendment).[394]Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico do not have presidential electors, and so people in those territories cannot vote for the president.\n Congressional Districts are reapportioned among the states following each decennial Census of Population. Each state then draws single-member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The total number of voting representatives is 435. There are also 6 non-voting representatives who represent the District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories.[395]\n The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they have a great deal of autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.[396]\n Citizenship is granted at birth in all states, the District of Columbia, and all major U.S. territories except American Samoa.[397][398]\n  State flags and statehood dates\n  (listed alphabetically)\n \n\n   (listed chronologically)\n \n\n   Statehood date is the date of ratifying the Constitution (for the first 13)or being admitted to the Union (for subsequent states) \n \n  Territory and district flags and dates\n  (listed alphabetically)\n \n\n   (listed chronologically)\n \n\n  Territory date is the date the territory was acquired by the United States, except for the District of Columbia, which was founded separately\n \n Parties and elections Main articles: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, and Political ideologies in the United States \n  Congressional leadership meeting with President Obama in 2011.[399] \n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump\n45th President\nsince January 20, 2017 \n \n  \n  Mike Pence\n48th Vice President\nsince January 20, 2017 \n \n \n\n\n In American political culture, the center-right Republican Party is considered \"conservative\" and the center-left Democratic Party is considered \"liberal\".[403] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as \"blue states\", are relatively liberal. The \"red states\" of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative. \n RepublicanDonald Trump, the winner of the 2016 presidential election, is serving as the 45th president of the United States.[404] Leadership in the Senate includes Republican vice president Mike Pence, Republican president pro tempore Chuck Grassley, Majority LeaderMitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.[405] Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Majority LeaderSteny Hoyer, and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.[406]\n In the 116th United States Congress, the House of Representatives is controlled by the Democratic Party and the Senate is controlled by the Republican Party, giving the U.S. a split Congress. The Senate consists of 53 Republicans, and 45 Democrats with 2 Independents who caucus with the Democrats; the House consists of 235 Democrats and 199 Republicans.[407] In state governorships, there are 27 Republicans and 23 Democrats.[408] Among the D.C. mayor and the 5 territorial governors, there are 2 Republicans, 1 Democrat, 1 New Progressive, and 2 Independents.[409][410]\n Foreign relations Main articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States \n  The United Nations Headquarters was built in Midtown Manhattan in 1952.[411] \n \n\n The United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[414] and strong ties with Canada,[415]Australia,[416]New Zealand,[417]the Philippines,[418]Japan,[419]South Korea,Israel, and several European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance, the most in the world. As a share of America's large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast, private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.Colombia is traditionally considered by the United States as its most loyal ally in South America. Policymakers in both countries consider Plan Colombia to be a foreign policy success for the United States.\n The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau. These are Pacific island nations, once part of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands after World War II, which gained independence in subsequent years.\n On October 25, 2017, Vice President Mike Pence announced at a In Defense of Christians annual dinner meeting in Washington that the United States would stop funding United Nations relief efforts, cases tackling the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, but insisted that the U.S. would instead help and aid Christians directly through the United States Agency for International Development. Pence said that he will be visiting the Middle East in December and will meet with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to discuss peace agreements.\n Government finance See also: Taxation in the United States and United States federal budget \n  U.S. federal debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, from 1790 to 2013.[430] \n \n\n \n  United States debt from 1940 to 2015.\n \n\n Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state, and local government levels. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. Taxation in the United States is based on citizenship, not residency.[431] Both non-resident citizens and Green Card holders living abroad are taxed on their income irrespective of where they live or where their income is earned. It is the only country in the world, other than Eritrea, to do so.\n In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[433] During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%).[434] Based on CBO estimates,[435] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.[436]\n U.S. taxation has historically been generally progressive, especially the federal income taxes, though by most measures it became noticeably less progressive after 1980.[437][438] It has sometimes been described as among the most progressive in the developed world, but this characterization is controversial.[439][440][441][438] The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes,[443] and about half of all taxes.[444] Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[445][446] The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[447][448] However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.[449]\n The top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes.[450] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile.[451] The incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades.[453] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.[454]\n During FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare &amp; Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).[434]\n The total national debt of the United States in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP) in 2014.[455][m] The United States has the largest external debt in the world[460] and the 14th largest government debt as a % of GDP in the world.[citation needed]\n Military Main article: United States Armed Forces \n  The carrier strike groups of the Kitty Hawk, Ronald Reagan, and Abraham Lincoln with aircraft from the Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force.\n \n\n The president is the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[461]\n Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System. American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad,[463] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[464]\n The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[465] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA.[466] Defense spending plays a major role in science and technology investment, with roughly half of U.S. federal research and development funded by the Department of Defense.[467] Defense's share of the overall U.S. economy has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.[468]\n  US global military presence.\n \n\n The proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.[469] The last American troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011;[470] 4,484 service members were killed during the Iraq War.[471] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012; by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan.[473]\n The country is one of the five recognizednuclear weapons states and possesses the second largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world.[474] More than 90% of world's 14,000 nuclear weapons are owned by Russia and the United States.[475]\n Law enforcement and crime Main articles: Law enforcement in the United States and Crime in the United States \n See also: Law of the United States, Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, Human rights in the United States § Justice system, Incarceration in the United States, and Capital punishment in the United States \n  Law enforcement in the U.S. is maintained primarily by local police departments. The New York Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country.\n \n\n Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police departments and sheriff's offices, with state police providing broader services. The New York Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[476] At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.[477]\n In 2015, there were 15,696 murders which was 1,532 more than in 2014, a 10.8% increase, the largest since 1971.[478] The murder rate in 2015 was 4.9 per 100,000 people.[479] In 2016 the murder rate increased by 8.6%, with 17,413 murders that year.[480] The national clearance rate for homicides in 2015 was 64.1%, compared to 90% in 1965.[481] In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980. In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other developed nations.[483] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States \"homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.\"[484]Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject of contentious political debate. In 2016, the US murder rate of 5.4 per 100,000 was similar to the estimated global average of 5.15 per 100,000.[485]\n In 2017, there were 17,264 murders and the murder rate was 5.3 per 100,000. Regarding weapons, 73% of murders were committed by firearm, 10% by knife and 17% by other means.[486] The violent crime rose sharply in the 1960s until the early 1990s and declined in the late 1990s and 2000s.[486] In 2014, the murder rate fell to the lowest level (4.5) since 1957 (4.0).[487] The violent crime rate increased by 5.9% between 2014 and 2017 and the murder rate by 20.5%. Of those arrested for serious violent crimes in 2017, 58.5% were white, 37.5% were black, 2.1% were American Indian or Alaska Native and 1.5% Asian. Ethnically, 23.5% were Hispanic and 76.5% were non-Hispanic.[488] Gun violence peaked in 1993 with 17,125 gun murders before declining to 9,527 in 1999 and steadily rising since to 12,772. Non-gun murders reached a peak in 1980 of 8,340 and declined in most years until the early 2010s with 4,668 in 2017.[489] The rate of robberies declined 62% between 1990 and 2017.[486]\n From 1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of homicide victims and 90% of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites (\"whites\" includes most Hispanics), and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims killed by whites.[490] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.[491] The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes.\n Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and also at the state level in 30 states.[493][494] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976 the Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.[495] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death-penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.[496]\n  Total incarceration in the United States by year\n \n\n The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and largest prison population in the world.[497] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults.[498] In December 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision in December 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997.[499] The prison population has quadrupled since 1980,[500] and state and local spending on prisons and jails has grown three times as much as that spent on public education during the same period.[501] However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013 and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012.[503] The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies.[504] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[505] The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been a subject of debate.[506][507] In 2018, Oklahoma had the highest incarceration rate (1,079 per 100,000 people), and Massachusetts the lowest (324 per 100,000 people).[508][509] Among the U.S. territories, the highest incarceration rate was in the U.S. Virgin Islands (542 per 100,000 people) and the lowest was in Puerto Rico (313 per 100,000 people).[510][511]\n Economy Main article: Economy of the United States \n See also: Economic history of the United States \n  Economic indicators   Nominal GDP  $20.66 trillion (Q3 2018)     Real GDP growth 3.5% (Q3 2018)      2.1% (2017)      CPI inflation 2.2% (November 2018)  [513]   Employment-to-population ratio 60.6% (November 2018)  [514]   Unemployment 3.7% (November 2018)  [515]    Labor force participation rate 62.9% (November 2018)  [516]   Total public debt $21.85 trillion (November 2018)  [517]   Household net worth $109.0 trillion (Q3 2018)  [518]   The United States has a capitalistmixed economy[citation needed] which is fueled by abundant natural resources and high productivity.[519] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).\n The nominal GDP of the U.S. is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014. From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7. The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita according to the United Nations (first in the Americas) and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP. The U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.\n The United States is the largest importer of goods and second-largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners. In 2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the country's largest export. Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt. The largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve, who hold the majority of the debt.[530][531][n]\n  The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street, by a significant margin the world's largest stock exchange per market capitalization of its listed companies,[534][535] at US$23.1 trillion as of April 2018.[536] \n \n\n In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%.[537] The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1.[538] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power.[539] The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing.[540] In the franchising business model, McDonald's and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the world.[541]\n Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field. The United States is the largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its second-largest importer.[543] It is the world's number one producer of nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The National Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium, copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, titanium and others.[544][545]\n Agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP,[539] yet the United States is the world's top producer of corn[546] and soybeans.[547] The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food, representing half of the world's biotech crops.[548] In the contiguous 48 states, 35% of the land is used as pasture, 28% is covered by forest, and 21% is agricultural cropland, with all other uses accounting for less than 20%.[549]\n  A tract housing development in San Jose, California \n \n\n Consumer spending comprises 68% of the U.S. economy in 2015.[550] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe.[551] The United States has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000. The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers.[553] The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to.[554]\n The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation[555] and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia.[556] While federal law does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations.[557] 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits.[557] In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.[558]\n The 2008–2012 global recession significantly affected the United States, with output still below potential according to the Congressional Budget Office.[559] It brought high unemployment (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising petroleum and food prices. \n Science and technology Main articles: Science and technology in the United States and Science policy of the United States \n  Astronaut James Irwin walking on the Moon next to Apollo 15's landing module and lunar rover in 1971\n \n\n The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor-saving techniques created the system called mass production.[560]\n In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's research laboratory, one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[561] The latter led to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.\n The rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[563] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and aeronautics.[564][565]\n The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[566][567][568] This, in turn, led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.[569]\n These advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for individual use.[570] As of 2013, 83.8% of American households owned at least one computer, and 73.3% had high-speed Internet service.[571] 91% of Americans also own a mobile phone as of May 2013. The United States ranks highly with regard to freedom of use of the internet.[573]\n In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector.[574] The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.[575][576]\n Income, poverty and wealth Further information: Income in the United States, Poverty in the United States, Affluence in the United States, United States counties by per capita income, and Income inequality in the United States \n Accounting for 4.4% of the global population, Americans collectively possess 41.6% of the world's total wealth,[577] and Americans make up roughly half of the world's population of millionaires.[578] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[579] Americans on average have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and more than every EU nation.[580] For 2017 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 13th among 189 countries in its Human Development Index and 25th among 151 countries in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[581]\n   Wealth inequality in the United States increased from 1989 to 2013.\n \n\n After years of stagnant growth, in 2016, according to the Census, median household income reached a record high after two consecutive years of record growth, although income inequality remains at record highs with top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income.[583] There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[584] However, the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance.[585] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected income inequality,[586] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[587] According to a 2018 study by the OECD, the United States has much higher income inequality and a larger percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation. This is largely because at-risk workers get almost no government support and are further set back by a very weak collective bargaining system.[588] The top 1 percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers.[589] The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.[590][591]\n  United States' families median net worth Source: Fed Survey of Consumer Finances[593]    in 2013 dollars 1998 2013 change    All families $102,500 $81,200 -20.8%    Bottom 20% of incomes $8,300 $6,100 -26.5%    2nd lowest 20% of incomes $47,400 $22,400 -52.7%    Middle 20% of incomes $76,300 $61,700 -19.1%    Top 10% $646,600 $1,130,700 +74.9%     Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.[594] According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016.[595] Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[596] Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down $14 trillion, but has since increased $14 trillion over 2006 levels.[597][598] At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to $11.8 trillion,[599] down from $13.8 trillion at the end of 2008.[600]\n There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[601] In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic. According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty, up from one in seven in 1980.[603] As of September 2017, 40 million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, with 18.5 million of those living in deep poverty (a family income below one-half of the poverty threshold). In 2016, 13.3 million children were living in poverty, which made up 32.6% of the impoverished population.[604]\n In 2017, the region with the lowest poverty rate was New Hampshire (7.3%), and the region with the highest poverty rate was American Samoa (65%).[605][606][607] Among the states, the highest poverty rate was in Mississippi (21.9%).[608] According to the UN, around five million people in the U.S. live in \"third world\" conditions.[609]\n Infrastructure Transportation Main article: Transportation in the United States \n  The Interstate Highway System, which extends 46,876 miles (75,440 km).[610] \n \n\n Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads,[611] including one of the world's longest highway systems at 57,000 mi (91,700 km). The world's second-largest automobile market,[613] the United States has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (1996).[614] About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.[615] The average American adult (accounting for all drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling 29 miles (47 km).[616] In 2017, there were 255,009,283 motor vehicles—including cars, vans, buses, freight, and other trucks, but excluding motorcycles and other two-wheelers—or 910 vehicles per 1,000 people.[617]\n  Map showing Amtrak (passenger) rail speeds in the United States.[618] \n \n\n Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips.[619]Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, partly because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior. However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010. Also, light rail development has increased in recent years. Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.\n The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while  most major airports are publicly owned. The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways. Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the fourth-busiest Los Angeles International Airport, and the sixth-busiest O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks of 2001, the Transportation Security Administration was created to police airports and commercial airliners. \n Energy Further information: Energy policy of the United States \n The United States energy market is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year.Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons (7076 kg) of oil equivalent per year, the 10th-highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[630] The United States is the world's largest consumer of petroleum.[631] The United States has 27% of global coal reserves. It is the world's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.[633]\n For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception following the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants were filed.[634]\n Since 2007, the total greenhouse gas emissions by the United States are the second highest by country, exceeded only by China.[635][636] The United States has historically been the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases and greenhouse gas emissions per capita remain high.[637]\n Water supply and sanitation Main article: Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States \n Issues that affect water supply in the United States include droughts in the West, water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.[638][639][o]\n Culture Main article: Culture of the United States \n The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[643] Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries.[644] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[645] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.\n Core American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism,[646] as well as a unifying belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[647] Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times the French figure of 0.14%.[648][649][650]\n The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[651] Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate.[653][654][655][656] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[657] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[658] Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree.[659] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.[660]\n Food Main article: Cuisine of the United States \n   Apple pie is a food commonly associated with American cuisine.\n \n\n Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour[661] and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. These homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[663]\n  Roasted turkey is a traditional menu item of an American Thanksgiving dinner.[664] \n \n\n Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[665] Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea.[666] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[667][668]\n American eating habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary roots with some variations. Although American lands could grow newer vegetables that Britain could not, most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by Europeans.[669] Over time American foods changed to a point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in 1972: \"Our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence\".[670]\n The American fast food industry, the world's largest,[671] pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s. Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake rose 24%;[665] frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American \"obesity epidemic\".[673] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake.[674]\n Literature, philosophy, and visual art Main articles: American literature, American philosophy, Architecture of the United States, and Visual art of the United States \n   Mark Twain, American author and humorist.\n \n\n In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[675] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)—may be dubbed the \"Great American Novel\".[676]\n Twelve U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Bob Dylan in 2016. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[677] Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[678]\n The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy, and Martha Nussbaum is its most important figure today. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have affected various fields in social and political philosophy.[679][680]\n In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[681]Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.[683]\n   Times Square in New York City, the hub of the Broadway theaterdistrict[684] \n \n\n One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O'Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.[685]\n ChoreographersIsadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance, while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet.[citation needed]\n Music Main articles: Music of the United States and American classical music \n Although little known at the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. \n The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[686]\n Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[687][688][689] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk. \n More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities,[686] as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Eminem, Kanye West, and Ariana Grande.[690]\n Cinema Main article: Cinema of the United States \n  The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California\n \n\n Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[691] The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope. The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[693]\n Director D. W. Griffith, the top American filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[694] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West and history, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting, with great influence on subsequent directors. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[695] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[696][697] In the 1970s, film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were a vital component in what became known as \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\",[698] grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[699] Since, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs, and in return, high earnings at the box office, with the Russo brothers, Avengers: Endgame (2019) being the highest grossing film of all time.[700]\n Notable films topping the American Film Institute's AFI 100 list include Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time,[701]Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler's List (1993), Singin' in the Rain (1952), It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).[703] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[704] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[705]\n Sports Main article: Sports in the United States \n   \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n The most popular American sports are American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey[706] \n\n \n\n American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport;[707] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally. Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different but overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.[708] In soccer, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men's national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women's team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup four times; Major League Soccer is the sport's highest league in the United States (featuring 21 American and 3 Canadian teams). The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[709]\n Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States (2028 Summer Olympics will mark the ninth time). As of 2017, the United States has won 2,522 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 305 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.[710] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[711] The most watched individual sports are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.[713]Rugby union is considered the fastest growing sport in the U.S., with registered players, numbered at 115,000+ and a further 1.2 million participants.[714]\n Mass media Main article: Media of the United States \n  The corporate headquarters of the American Broadcasting Company in New York City\n \n\n The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[715] Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[716]\n In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other). As of September 30, 2014, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[717]\n Well-known newspapers include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and USA Today.[718] Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have \"alternative weeklies\" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.[719] Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon, and Twitter.\n More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.\n See also \n     Notes  ^\n  ^English is the official language of 32 states; English and Hawaiian are both official languages in Hawaii, and English and 20 Indigenous languages are official in Alaska. Algonquian, Cherokee, and Sioux are among many other official languages in Native-controlled lands throughout the country. French is a de facto, but unofficial, language in Maine and Louisiana, while New Mexico law grants Spanish a special status.[4][5] \n  ^ In five territories, English as well as one or more indigenous languages are official: Spanish in Puerto Rico, Samoan in American Samoa, Chamorro in both Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Carolinian is also an official language in the Northern Mariana Islands. \n  ^ abcThe Encyclopædia Britannica lists China as the world's third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) with a total area of 9,572,900 sq km,[16] and the United States as fourth-largest at 9,526,468 sq km. The figure for the United States is less than in the CIA World Factbook because it excludes coastal and territorial waters.[17]\nThe CIA World Factbook lists the United States as the third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) with total area of 9,833,517 sq km,[18] and China as fourth-largest at 9,596,960 sq km.[19] This figure for the United States is greater than in the Encyclopædia Britannica because it includes coastal and territorial waters. \n  ^ ab Excludes Puerto Rico and the other unincorporated islands. \n  ^ See Time in the United States for details about laws governing time zones in the United States. \n  ^ Except the U.S. Virgin Islands. \n  ^ISO 3166 designation. In actual use, the six original Generic top-level domains are preferred. \n  ^The five major territories are American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. There are eleven smaller island areas without permanent populations: Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, and Palmyra Atoll. U.S. sovereignty over Bajo Nuevo Bank, Navassa Island, Serranilla Bank, and Wake Island is disputed.[15] \n  ^Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska to assert its long-held claim over the Pacific Northwest, which dated back to the 16th century. During the decade 1785–1795 British merchants, encouraged by Sir Joseph Banks and supported by their government, made a sustained attempt to develop this trade despite Spain's claims and navigation rights. The endeavors of these merchants did not last long in the face of Spain's opposition. The challenge was also opposed by a Japanese holding obdurately to national seclusion.[99] \n  ^Fertility is also a factor; in 2010 the average Hispanic woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her lifetime, compared to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic white women (both below the replacement rate of 2.1). Between 2006 and 2017 the population growth rate for Hispanics dropped from 3.7% to 2.0%, for Asians from 3.5% to 2.9%, for blacks from 1.0% to 0.9% and for non-Hispanic whites from 0.1% to 0.0%. Hispanics accounted for 51% of the population increase between 2016 and 2017.Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 36.3% of the population in 2010 (this is nearly 40% in 2015), and over 50% of children under age one, and are projected to constitute the majority by 2042. This contradicts the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports, based on the U.S. census data, which concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386 in 2010) of births were non-Hispanic white. The Hispanic birth rate plummeted 25% between 2006 and 2013 while the rate for non-Hispanics decreased just 5%. \n  ^Source: 2015 American Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau. Most respondents who speak a language other than English at home also report speaking English \"well\" or \"very well\". For the language groups listed above, the strongest English-language proficiency is among speakers of German (96% report that they speak English \"well\" or \"very well\"), followed by speakers of French (93.5%), Tagalog (92.8%), Spanish (74.1%), Korean (71.5%), Chinese (70.4%), and Vietnamese (66.9%). \n  ^In January 2015, U.S. federal government debt held by the public was approximately $13 trillion, or about 72% of U.S. GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5 trillion, giving a combined total debt of $18.080 trillion.[456][457] By 2012, total federal debt had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP.[458] The U.S. has a credit rating of AA+ from Standard &amp; Poor's, AAA from Fitch, and AAA from Moody's.[459] \n  ^The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, found that the United States' arms industry was the world's biggest exporter of major weapons from 2005 to 2009, and remained the largest exporter of major weapons during a period between 2010 and 2014, followed by Russia, China (PRC), and Germany.[533] \n  ^Droughts are likely to particularly affect the 66 percent of Americans whose communities depend on surface water.[640] As for drinking water quality, there are concerns about disinfection by-products, lead, perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances, but generally drinking water quality in the U.S. is good.[641] \n \n\n References   ^McKenna 2007, p. 280. \n  ^Kidder &amp; Oppenheim 2007, p. 91. \n  ^\"uscode.house.gov\".

Spanish is the second most commonly spoken language.\n Whether the United States or the People's Republic of China is larger is argued against. The figure given is from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's World Factbook. Other sources give smaller figures. All strict calculations of the country's size include only the fifty states and the District of Columbia, not the territories.\n The population estimate includes people whose usual residence is in the fifty states and the District of Columbia, including foreigners. It does not include either those living in the territories, amounting to more than 4 million U.S. citizens (most in Puerto Rico), or U.S. citizens living outside the United States.\n \n  The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federalconstitutional republic containing fifty states and a federal district. The country is located mostly in central North America, where its forty-eight touching states and Washington, D.C., the capital district, lie between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The state of Alaska is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to its east and Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also possesses some territories, or insular areas, in the Caribbean and Pacific. \n At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km2) and with about 306 million people, the United States is the third or fourth-largest country by total area and third-largest by land area and by population. The United States is one of the world's most ethnically mixed and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries.[8] The U.S. economy is the largest national economy in the world, with an estimated 2016 gross domestic product (GDP) of US$20.4 trillion (about a quarter of worldwide GDP).[9]\n The nation was founded by thirteen colonies of Great Britain located along the Atlantic seaboard. On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which announced their independence from Great Britain and their creation of a cooperative union. The disobedient states defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence.[10] The Philadelphia Convention adopted the current United States Constitution on September 17, 1787; its approval the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government. The Bill of Rights, making up ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many basic civil rights and freedoms, was approved in 1791. \n In the 19th century, the United States received land from France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Russia, and took over the Republic of Texas and the Republic of Hawaii. Arguments between the farming-based South and industrial North over states' rights and the growth of the institution of slavery began the American Civil War of the 1860s. The North's victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the end of legal slavery in the United States. By the 1870s, the national wealth was the world's largest.[11] The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a military power. In 1945, the United States came out from World War II as the first country with nuclear weapons, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and a founding member of NATO. The end of the Cold War and the breaking up of the Soviet Union left the United States as the only superpower. The country accounts for about half of worldwide military spending and is a leading economic, political, and cultural force in the world.\n Contents\n\n  Geography[change | change source]  Main article: Geography of the United States \n   Satellite imagery of the contiguous United States.\n \n\n The land area of the contiguous United States is 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,941 km2). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 km2). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area.[13] The United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China. The ranking differs depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured. The Encyclopædia Britannica, for instance, lists the size of the United States as 3,677,649 square miles (9,525,067 km2), as they do not count the country's coastal or territorial waters.[14]The World Factbook, which includes those waters, gives 3,796,742 square miles (9,833,517 km2).[15]\n The U.S's geography varies a lot and includes: \n The climate varies along with the geography, from tropical (hot and wet in summer, warm and dry in winter) in Florida to tundra (cold all year) in Alaska. Large parts of the country have warm summers and cold winters. Some parts of the United States, like parts of California, have a Mediterranean climate. \n  History[change | change source]  Main article: History of the United States \n  Native Americans and European settlers[change | change source]  Main articles: Native Americans in the United States, European colonization of the Americas, and Thirteen Colonies \n  An ancient palace built by the Anasazi people in Mesa Verde National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Colorado.\n \n\n It is believed that the indigenous peoples of the continental United States, including the natives of Alaska, moved in from Asia. They began arriving twelve or forty thousand years ago, if not earlier.[16] Some, such as the pre-ColumbianMississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced farming, grand construction, and state-level communities. The native population of America decreased after Europeans arrived, and for different reasons, mostly sicknesses such as smallpox and measles.[17]\n In 1492, Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus, under contract to the Spanish crown, reached some Caribbean islands, making the first contact with the native people. On April 2, 1513, Spanish conquistadorJuan Ponce de León landed on what he called \"La Florida\"—the first recorded European coming on what would become the U.S. mainland. Spanish settlements in the area were followed by ones in the present-day southwestern United States that drew thousands through Mexico. French fur traders established outposts of New France around the Great Lakes; France eventually claimed much of the North American interior, down to the Gulf of Mexico. The first successful English settlements were the Colony of Virginia in Jamestown in 1607 and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. The 1628 chartering of the Massachusetts Bay Colony resulted in a wave of relocation; by 1634, New England had been settled by some 10,000 Puritans. Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution, about 50,000 convicts were shipped to Britain's American colonies.[18] Beginning in 1614, the Dutch settled along the lower Hudson River, including New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. \n  Independence and expansion[change | change source]  Main articles: American Revolution, American Revolutionary War, and Manifest destiny \n   Declaration of Independence, by John Trumbull, 1817–18\n \n\n Tensions between American colonials and the British during the rebel period of the 1760s and early 1770s led to the American Revolutionary War, fought from 1775 through 1781. On June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, established a Continental Army under the command of George Washington. Announcing that \"all men are created equal\" and are born with \"certain natural rights,\" the Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, drafted mostly by Thomas Jefferson, on July 4, 1776. That date is now celebrated every year as America's Independence Day. In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak federal government that operated until 1789. \n After the British defeat by American forces helped by the French, Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States and the states' sovereignty over American land west to the Mississippi River. A constitutional convention was organized in 1787 by those wishing to establish a strong national government, with powers of taxation. The United States Constitution was approved in 1788, and the new republic's first Senate, House of Representatives, and President—George Washington—took office in 1789. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and certifying a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791. \n Attitudes toward slavery were shifting; a clause in the Constitution protected the African slave trade only until 1808. The Northern states permanently stopped slavery between 1780 and 1804, leaving the slave states of the South as defenders of the \"peculiar institution.\" The Second Great Awakening, beginning about 1800, made evangelicalism a force behind different social reform movements, including abolitionism. \n  Land-based purchases by date.\n \n\n Americans' eagerness to expand westward caused a long series of Indian Wars and an Indian removal policy that stripped the native peoples of their land. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed land under President Thomas Jefferson in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size. The War of 1812, declared against Britain over different complaints and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. A series of U.S. military invasions into Florida led Spain to give up it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. The United States took over the Republic of Texas in 1845. The idea of Manifest destiny became popular during this time.[19] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. The U.S. victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest. The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 further encouraged western relocation. New railways made relocation easier for settlers and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, up to 40 million American bison, or buffalo, were murdered for skins and meat and to ease the railways' spread. The loss of the buffalo, which were valuable to the plains Indians, caused many native cultures to become gone forever. \n  Civil War and industrialization[change | change source]  See also: American Civil War, Reconstruction era, and Spanish–American War \n   Battle of Gettysburg, lithograph by Currier and Ives, ca. 1863\n \n\n Tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over the relationship between the state and federal governments, as well as violent conflicts over the spread of slavery into new states. Abraham Lincoln, a candidate of the mostly antislavery Republican Party, was elected president in 1860. Before he took office, seven slave states declared their secession—which the federal government maintained was illegal—and formed the Confederate States of America. With the Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter, the American Civil War began and four more slave states joined the Confederacy. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation committed the Union to end slavery. Following the Union victory in 1865, three changes to the U.S. Constitution secured freedom for the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,made them citizens, and gave them voting rights. The war and its resolution led to a big increase in federal power.\n  Immigrants landing on Ellis Island, New York, 1902.\n \n\n After the war, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln caused the Reconstruction, where policies were put together directed at getting back and rebuilding the Southern states while securing the rights of the newly freed slaves. The resolution of the disputed 1876 presidential election by the Compromise of 1877 ended this era, and the Jim Crow laws soon disenfranchised many African Americans. In the North, urbanization and a never-before-seen inflow of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe made the country's industrialization grow rapidly. The wave of immigration, lasting until 1929, gave labor and changed American culture. High tax protections, national infrastructure building, and new banking laws encouraged growth also. The 1867 Alaska Purchase from Russia completed the country's mainland expansion. The Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890 was the last major armed conflict of the Indian Wars. In 1893, the native monarchy of the Pacific Kingdom of Hawaii was ended in a secret and successful plan led by American residents; the United States took over the archipelago in 1898. Victory in the Spanish–American War the same year proved that the United States was a world power and led to the addition of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. The Philippines gained independence fifty years later; Puerto Rico and Guam are still U.S. territories. \n  World War I, Great Depression, and World War II[change | change source]   An abandoned farm in South Dakota during the Dust Bowl, in 1936.\n \n\n As the First World War erupted in Europe in 1914, the United States declared itself neutral. Afterward, the Americans sympathized with the British and French, even though many citizens, especially those from Ireland and Germany, were against the intervention. In 1917, they joined the Allies, adding to the defeat of the Central Powers. Unwilling to participate in European affairs, the Senate did not approve the Treaty of Versailles (1919), which established the League of Nations, applying a policy of unilateralism, which bordered on isolationism. In 1920, the Women's rights movement gained the approval of a constitutional amendment to grant women the right to vote.\n  Soldiers of United States Army about to disembark on June 6, 1944 on Omaha Beach (France) during Battle of Normandy of Second World War.\n \n\n The United States, officially neutral during the early stages of World War II, began supplying supplies to the Allies in March 1941, through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the country joined the Allies fight against the Axis Powers, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. World War II boosted the economy by providing investment capital and jobs, making many women enter the labor market. Of the significant fighters, the United States was the only nation to be enriched by war. The discussions at Bretton Woods and Yalta created a new system of international organization that placed the country and the Soviet Union at the heart of world affairs. In 1945, when the end of the Second World War in Europe came, an international gathering held in San Francisco drafted the Charter of the United Nations, which came into force after the war. Having developed the first nuclear weapon, the government decided to use it in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of that same year. Japan gave up on September 2, ending the war.[30]\n  Cold War and civil rights era[change | change source]  See also: Cold War, McCarthyism, Civil rights movement, Vietnam War, and Watergate scandal \n   Martin Luther King, Jr. delivering his world-renowned \"I Have a Dream\" speech in 1963.\n \n\n  The \"Baker\" explosion, part of Operation Crossroads, at Bikini Atoll, Micronesia, in 1946.\n \n\n In the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed after the Second World War, controlling the military affairs of Europe through NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The first supported liberal democracy and capitalism, while the second favored communism and an economy planned by the government. Both supported several dictatorships and participated in proxy wars. Between 1950 and 1953, U.S. troops fought Chinese communist forces in the Korean War.[31] From the break with the USSR and the start of the Cold War until 1957, McCarthyism also called the Second Red Dread, developed within the United States. The State unleashed a wave of political mistreatment and a campaign of prejudice against Communists, which some authors point out as of a totalitarian state. Hundreds of people were arrested, including celebrities, and between 10,000 and 12,000 people lost their jobs. The abuse ended when the courts declared it unconstitutional.[33]\n   Richard Nixon leaving the White House after resigning as a result of the Watergate scandal, August 9, 1974.\n \n\n In 1961, the Soviet launch of the first human-crewed spacecraft caused President John F. Kennedy to propose to the country to be the first to send \"a man to the Moon\", a fact completed in 1969.[34] Kennedy also faced a tense nuclear conflict with the Soviet forces in Cuba, while the economy grew and expanded steadily. A growing movement for civil rights, represented and led by African-Americans such as Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr. and James Bevel, used nonviolence to deal with segregation and discrimination.[35] After Kennedy's murder in 1963, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were passed during the term of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson and his successor, Richard Nixon, led a civil war in Southeast Asia, assistant to the unsuccessful Vietnam War. A generalized counterculture movement grew, driven by opposition to war, black nationalism and the sexual revolution. A new wave of feminist movements also emerged, led by Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem and other women who sought political, social and economic equity. \n In 1974, as a result of the Watergate scandal, Nixon became the first president to resign, to avoid being dismissed on charges such as obstruction of justice and abuse of power, and was succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford.[36] The presidency of Jimmy Carter in the 1970s was marked by stagflation and the hostage crisis in Iran. The election of Ronald Reagan as president in 1980 announced a change in U.S. policy, which was reflected in significant changes in taxes and fiscal expenses. His second term brought with it the Iran–Contra affair and the significant diplomatic progress with the Soviet Union. The later Soviet collapse ended the Cold War. \n  Modern history[change | change source]  See also: September 11 attacks, War in Afghanistan (2001–present), Iraq War, Great Recession, and International military intervention against ISIL \n  A large cloud of dust surrounds the city of New York after the collapse of the Twin Towers after the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.\n \n\n Under President George H. W. Bush, the country took on a global dominant role worldwide, as in the Gulf War (1991). The longest economic expansion in modern American history, from March 1991 to March 2001, spanned the presidency of Bill Clinton and the dot-com bubble.[37] A civil lawsuit and a sex scandal led to his impeachment in 1998, although he managed to finish his period. The 2000 presidential elections, one of the most competitive in American history, they were settled by the Supreme Court: George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, became president, even though he gained fewer votes than his opponent Al Gore.[38]\n On September 11, 2001, the terrorists of the Al-Qaeda group attacked the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City (which were destroyed) and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., in a series of attacks that ended the life of nearly three thousand people. In response, the Bush administration launched the \"War on Terror.\" At the end of 2001, U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan, toppled the Taliban government and destroyed Al-Qaeda's training camps. Taliban insurgents continue to fight a guerrilla war. In 2002, Bush began to push for a regime change to take place in Iraq.[39][40] With NATO's lack of support and without a clear UN order for military intervention, Bush organized the coalition of the willing; The coalition forces quickly invaded Iraq in 2003 and toppled the statue of dictator Saddam Hussein. The following year, Bush was re-elected as the most voted president in an election. \n In 2005, Hurricane Katrina, which would end up being the deadliest natural disaster in national history, caused severe destruction along the Gulf Coast: the city of New Orleans was devastated, with 1833 dead.[41]\n  President Donald Trump with his predecessor Barack Obama, the first African American president.\n \n\n On November 4, 2008, during a global economic downturn, Barack Obama was elected president, having been the first African American to take office. In May 2011, American Special forces managed to kill Osama bin Laden, hiding in Pakistan. The following year, Barack Obama was re-elected. Under his second term, he led the war against the Islamic State and restored diplomatic relations with Cuba. \n On November 8, 2016, the Republican Party leader Donald Trump defeated former First Lady Hillary Clinton for presidency in an unusual election and whose plans have been described by political analysts as populist, protectionist and nationalist, assuming office on January 20, 2017.\n The massacres in Orlando of June 12, 2016 at the gay disco Pulse (51 dead) and in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017 (60) are listed as the largest massacres in the country since 9/11.[43]\n  Government[change | change source]  Main article: Federal government of the United States \n The United States is a federalrepublic. The federal government of the United States is set up by the Constitution. There are three branches. They are the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. State governments and the federal government work in very similar ways. Each state has its own executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The executive branch of a state government is led by a governor, instead of a president. \n  Executive branch[change | change source]  The executive branch is the part of the government that enforces the law. Members of the U.S. Electoral College elect a president who is the leader of the executive branch, as well as the leader of the armed forces. The president may veto a bill that the Congress has passed, so it does not become a law. The President may also make \"executive orders\" to ensure that people follow the law. \n The president is in charge of many departments that control much of the day-to-day actions of government. For example, Department of Commerce makes rules about trade. The president chooses the heads of these departments, and also nominates federal judges. However, the Senate, part of the legislative branch, must agree with all of the people the president chooses. The president may serve two 4-year terms. \n  Legislative branch[change | change source]   The west side of the United States Capitol, which is home to the United States Congress \n \n\n The legislative branch makes laws. The legislative branch is called the United States Congress. Congress is divided into two \"houses\". \n One house is the House of Representatives. The Representatives are each elected by voters from a set area within a state. The number of Representatives a state has is based on how many people live there. Representatives serve two-year terms. The total number of representatives today is 435. The leader of the House of Representatives is the Speaker of the House. \n The other house is the Senate. In the Senate, each state is represented equally, by two senators. Because there are 50 states, there are 100 senators. The President's treaties or appointments of officials need the Senate's approval. Senators serve six-year terms. The Vice President of the United States serves as president of the Senate. In practice, the vice president is usually absent from the Senate, and a senator serves as president pro tempore, or temporary president, of the Senate. \n Representatives and senators propose laws, called \"bills\", in their respective houses. A bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group, known as a committee, which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house. If one house votes to pass a bill, the bill then gets sent to the other house; if both houses vote for it, it is then sent to the president, who may sign the bill into law or veto it. If the president vetoes the bill, it is sent back to Congress. If Congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two-thirds majority, the bill becomes law and cannot be vetoed by the president. \n Under the American system of federalism, Congress may not make laws that directly control the states; instead, Congress may use the promise of federal funds, or special circumstances such as national emergencies, to encourage the states to follow federal law. This system is both complex and unique. \n  Judicial branch[change | change source]  The judicial branch is the part of government that interprets what the law means. The Judicial Branch is made up of the Supreme Court and many lower courts. If the Supreme Court decides that a law is not allowed by the Constitution, the law is said to be \"struck down\" and is no longer a valid law. \n The Supreme Court is made up of nine judges, called justices, who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. One of these justices, called the chief justice, heads the court. A Supreme Court justice serves until he or she dies or resigns (quits in the middle of his or her term). When that happens, the president nominates someone new to replace the justice who left. If the Senate agrees with that choice, the person becomes a justice. If the Senate does not agree with the president's choice, then the president must nominate someone else. \n Famous court cases such as Marbury v Madison (which was decided in 1803) have firmly established that the Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the United States Constitution and has the power to strike down any law that conflicts with it.[44]\n  Politics[change | change source]  See also: States of the United States and Politics of the United States \n  The political system of the United States\n \n\n The United States of America consists of 50 states, 5 territories and 1 district (Washington D.C.). States can make laws about things inside the state, but federal law is about things dealing with more than one state or dealing with other countries. In some areas, if the federal government makes laws that say different things from the state laws, people must follow the federal law because the state law is not a law any more. Each state has a constitution of its own, different from the federal (national) Constitution. Each of these is like the federal Constitution because they say how each state's government is set up, but some also talk about specific laws. \n The federal and most state governments are dominated by two political parties: the Republicans and the Democrats. There are many smaller parties; the largest of these are the Libertarian Party and the Green Party. People help in political campaigns that they like. They try to persuade politicians to help them; this is called lobbying. All Americans are allowed to do these things, but some have and spend more money than others, or in other ways do more in politics. Some people think this is a problem, and lobby for rules to be made to change it. \n Since 2017, the president is a Republican, and Congress is also Republican-controlled, so the Republicans have more power in the federal government. There are still many powerful Democrats who can try to stop the Republicans from doing things that they believe will be bad for the country. Also, members of a party in power do not always agree on what to do. If enough people decide to vote against Republicans in the next election, they will lose power. In a republic like the United States, no party can do whatever they want. All politicians have to argue, compromise, and make deals with each other to get things done. They have to answer to the people and take responsibility for their mistakes. \n The USA's large cultural, economic, and military influence has made the foreign policy of the United States, or relations with other countries, a topic in American politics, and the politics of many other countries. \n  Political divisions[change | change source]  Main articles: U.S. state, Territorial evolution of the United States, and Territorial changes of the United States \n  States[change | change source]  See also: List of U.S. states \n The United States conquered and bought new lands over time, and grew from the original 13 colonies in the east to the current 50 states, of which 48 of them are joined together to make up the contiguous United States. These states, called the \"lower 48\", can all be reached by road without crossing a border into another country. They go from the Atlantic east to the Pacific in the west. There are two other states which are not joined to the lower 48 states. Alaska can be reached by passing through British Columbia and the Yukon, both of which are part of Canada. Hawaii is located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and is so far from the rest of the US that it can only be reached by airplane. \n Washington, D.C., the national capital, is a federal district that was split from the states of Maryland and Virginia in 1791. Not part of any US state, it used to be in the shape of a square, with the land west of the Potomac River coming from Virginia, and the land east of the river coming from Maryland. In 1846, Virginia took back its part of the land. Some people living in DC want it to become a state, or for Maryland to take back its land, so that they can have the right to vote in Congress. \n  Territories and possessions[change | change source]  The United States consists of sixteen lands that are not states, many of which are colonialterritories. None of them have any land borders with the rest of the US. People live in five of these places, which are de facto American: \n The Philippines was a possession of the United States. Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and other Pacific island nations were governed by the United States as a United Nations \"Trust Territory\". All of these places have become independent: the Philippines in 1946, Palau in 1947, and Micronesia in 1986. \n The U.S. armed forces has bases in many countries, and the U.S. Navy's base at Guantanamo Bay was rented from Cuba after that country had a Communist revolution. \n  Counties and cities[change | change source]  See also: List of United States cities by population \n All the states are divided into administrative subdivisions. Most of them are called counties, but Louisiana uses the word \"parish,\" and Alaska uses the word \"borough.\" \n There are many cities in the United States. One city in each state is the state capital, where the government of the state meets and the governor works. This city is not always the largest in its state. For example, the city with the most people living in it is New York City in New York State, but the state capital is Albany. Some other big cities are Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; Miami, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Las Vegas, Nevada; Houston and Dallas, Texas; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Boston, Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado; St. Louis, Missouri and Detroit, Michigan. \n  Economy[change | change source]  The United States has a capitalisteconomy. The country has rich mineralresources, with many gold, coal and uranium deposits. Farming makes the country among the top producers of, among others, corn (maize), wheat, sugar, and tobacco. Housing contributes about 15% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States[45]America produces cars, airplanes, and electronics. About 3/4 of Americans work in the service industry. \n The top 15 trading partners in terms of total trade are: \n  Country  Canada China Mexico Japan Germany UK South Korea France Taiwan Netherlands Brazil Malaysia Italy Singapore Ireland   Demographics[change | change source]   Historical population   Census Pop. %±   1790 3,929,000  —   1800 5,308,000  35.1%   1810 7,240,000  36.4%    9,638,000  33.1%   1830 12,866,000  33.5%   1840 17,063,000  32.6%   1850 23,192,000  35.9%   1860 31,443,321  35.6%   1870 38,558,371  22.6%   1880 50,189,209  30.2%   1890 62,979,766  25.5%   1900 76,212,168  21.0%   1910 92,228,531  21.0%    106,021,568  15.0%   1930 123,202,660  16.2%   1940 132,164,569  7.3%   1950 151,325,798  14.5%   1960 179,323,175  18.5%   1970 203,211,926  13.3%   1980 226,545,805  11.5%   1990 248,709,873  9.8%    281,421,906  13.2%    308,745,538  9.7%   The United States of America has people of many different race and ethnic backgrounds. 80% of the people in the United States descend from Europeanimmigrants. Many people are descended from Germany, England, Scotland, Ireland, Africa, and Italy.[46] 13% of the people in the United States are African-American. Most of them descend from the African slaves that were brought to America. Asian-Americans make up only 5% of the population in America but make up a bigger portion in the west coast. For example, in California, Asian-Americans make up 13% of the population of that state. Hispanic-Americans or people of Latin origins make up 15% of the nation. The original peoples, called Native American, American Indians, or Amerindians and Inuit (Eskimos) are a very small group. \n 11% of the people in the United States are foreign born. 18% speak a language other than English at home. For people 25 and older, 80% are high schoolgraduates while 25% have a bachelor's degree or higher. \n The 2000 Census counted self-reported ancestry. It identified 43 million German-Americans, 30.5 million Irish-Americans, 24.9 million African-Americans, 24.5 million English-Americans, and 18.4 million Mexican-Americans. \n  Money[change | change source]  The socialstructure of the United States has a big range. This means that some Americans are much, much richer than others. The average (median) income for an American was $37,000 a year in 2002. However, the richest 1% of Americans have as much money as the poorest 90%. 51% of all households have access to a computer and 41% had access to the Internet in 2000, a figure which had grown to 75% in 2004. Also, 67.9% of American families owned their homes in 2002. There are 200 million cars in the United States, two for every three Americans. The debt has grown to over $21,000,000,000,000. \n  Religion[change | change source]  There are many different religions in the U.S. Statistically, the largest religion is Christianity, including groups such as Catholicism, Protestantism and Mormonism. Other religions include Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Unitarian Universalism, Wicca, Druidry, Baha'i, Raelism, Zoroastrianism, Taoism and Jainism.[47] Religions which were founded within the United States include Eckankar, Satanism and Scientology. Native American religions have various animistic beliefs. \n The United States is one of the most religious countries in the Western World, and most Americans believe in God. The number of Christians in the U.S. has gone down. 86.2% called themselves Christian in 1990 and 78.4% said this in 2007. The others include Judaism (2.3%), Islam (0.8%), Buddhism (0.7%), Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%). Those who have no religion are at 16.1%. There is a large difference between those who say that they belong to a religion and those who are members of a religious body of that religion.[48]\n Doubts about the existence of a God, gods or goddesses are higher among young people.[49] Among the non-religious population of the U.S., there are deists, humanists, ignotic, atheists, and agnostics.[50]\n  Languages[change | change source]   Languages (2007)   English 225.5 million    Spanish, incl. Creole  34.5 million    Chinese 2.5 million    French, incl. Creole  2.0 million    Tagalog 1.5 million    Vietnamese 1.2 million    German 1.1 million    Korean 1.1 million    Arabic  0.3 million    The United States does not have an official language, the United States Congress has considered officially designating English as such for many years,[51] since it is the most used language, and the language in which the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution are written. 38 states out of 50 have English as the official language. Spanish has increased in usage in certain sectors of society, due to a flow of immigrants—especially from Mexico and Cuba. French is also a main language in parts of Louisiana because France once owned the area as a colony. \n  Culture[change | change source]  American popular culture goes out to many places in the world. It has a large influence on most of the world, especially the Western world. American music is heard all over the world, and American movies and television shows can be seen in most countries. \n  Federal holidays[change | change source]    Date  Name  Description    January 1 New Year's Day Celebrates the beginning of the year    3rd Monday in January   Martin Luther King, Jr. Day  Honors Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., an African-Americancivil rights leader    3rd Monday in February  President's Day Honors all of the American presidents, but specifically George Washington (b.

It is one of many symbols of the United States like the Bald Eagle. The 50 stars represent the 50 states. The red stands for courage. The blue stands for justice. The white represents peace and cleanliness. The 13 stripes represent the 13 original colonies.[53]\n  Related pages[change | change source]   References[change | change source]    ↑\"United States\".

Besides the 48 conterminous states that occupy the middle latitudes of the continent, the United States includes the state of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and the island state of Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The conterminous states are bounded on the north by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States is the fourth largest country in the world in area (after Russia, Canada, and China). The national capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the District of Columbia, the federal capital region created in 1790.\n The major characteristic of the United States is probably its great variety. Its physical environment ranges from the Arctic to the subtropical, from the moist rain forest to the arid desert, from the rugged mountain peak to the flat prairie. Although the total population of the United States is large by world standards, its overall population density is relatively low. The country embraces some of the world’s largest urban concentrations as well as some of the most extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.\n \n\n United StatesThe United States.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.\n The United States contains a highly diverse population. Unlike a country such as China that largely incorporated indigenous peoples, the United States has a diversity that to a great degree has come from an immense and sustained global immigration. Probably no other country has a wider range of racial, ethnic, and cultural types than does the United States. In addition to the presence of surviving Native Americans (including American Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos) and the descendants of Africans taken as slaves to the New World, the national character has been enriched, tested, and constantly redefined by the tens of millions of immigrants who by and large have come to America hoping for greater social, political, and economic opportunities than they had in the places they left. (It should be noted that although the terms “America” and “Americans” are often used as synonyms for the United States and its citizens, respectively, they are also used in a broader sense for North, South, and Central America collectively and their citizens.)\n The United States is the world’s greatest economic power, measured in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). The nation’s wealth is partly a reflection of its rich natural resources and its enormous agricultural output, but it owes more to the country’s highly developed industry. Despite its relative economic self-sufficiency in many areas, the United States is the most important single factor in world trade by virtue of the sheer size of its economy. Its exports and imports represent major proportions of the world total. The United States also impinges on the global economy as a source of and as a destination for investment capital. The country continues to sustain an economic life that is more diversified than any other on Earth, providing the majority of its people with one of the world’s highest standards of living.\n  Like what you’re reading?

America was the first of the European colonies to separate successfully from its motherland, and it was the first nation to be established on the premise that sovereignty rests with its citizens and not with the government. In its first century and a half, the country was mainly preoccupied with its own territorial expansion and economic growth and with social debates that ultimately led to civil war and a healing period that is still not complete. In the 20th century the United States emerged as a world power, and since World War II it has been one of the preeminent powers. It has not accepted this mantle easily nor always carried it willingly; the principles and ideals of its founders have been tested by the pressures and exigencies of its dominant status. The United States still offers its residents opportunities for unparalleled personal advancement and wealth. However, the depletion of its resources, the contamination of its environment, and the continuing social and economic inequality that perpetuates areas of poverty and blight all threaten the fabric of the country.\n The District of Columbia is discussed in the article Washington. For discussion of other major U.S. cities, see the articles Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Political units in association with the United States include Puerto Rico, discussed in the article Puerto Rico, and several Pacific islands, discussed in Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.\n  \n          United States of America \n  \n \n    \n   \n   \n   \n        United States of America\n \n \n Contents\n\n\n\n \n\n   Location  Flag  Quick Facts  Capital Washington, DC   Government  Federal Presidential Constitutional Republic    Currency  US Dollar    Area  9,826,675km2\nwater: 664,709km2\nland: 9,161,966km2    Population  319,309,000(2014 estimate)    Language  English (de facto), \nSpanish, French, Hawaiian, Samoan, Chamorro, Carolinian ,Cherokee and many other indigenous languages are recognized at State and Territorial levels    Religion  Protestant 51.3%, Roman Catholic 23.9%, Mormon 1.7%, other Christian 1.6%, Jewish 1.7%, Buddhist 0.7%, Muslim 0.6%, other or unspecified 2.5%, unaffiliated 12.1%, none 4% (2007 estimate)    Electricity  120V, 60Hz (Type \"A\" plug)    Country code  +1    Internet TLD  .us, .edu, .gov, .mil (most sites use .com, .net, .org)    Time Zone  UTC -4 to UTC -10    Emergencies  dial 911 or access emergency services through Operator \"0\"   \n  Map of the mainland US, insular areas and Minor Outlying Islands.\n \n\n The United States of America is a large country in North America, often referred to as \"the USA\", \"the U.S.\", \"the United States\", \"the United States of America\", \"the States\", or simply \"America\". Home to the world's third-largest population, with over 318 million people, it includes both densely populated cities with sprawling suburbs and vast, uninhabited natural areas. \n With its history of mass immigration dating from the 17th century, it is a \"melting pot\" of cultures from around the world and plays a dominant role in the world's cultural landscape. It's home to a wide array of popular tourist destinations, ranging from the skyscrapers of Manhattan and Chicago to the natural wonders of Yellowstone and Alaska, to the warm, sunny beaches of Florida and Hawaii and the deserts of Arizona. \n  Understand[edit]   \"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness.\"— Mark Twain. The Innocents Abroad  The United States can not be defined solely by television and movies. It is large, complex, and diverse, with several distinct regional identities. Due to the vast distances involved, traveling between regions often means crossing through many different landscapes, climates, and even time zones. Such travel can often be time-consuming and expensive but is often very rewarding. \n  Geography[edit]  The contiguous United States or the \"Lower 48\" (the 48 states other than Alaska and Hawaii) is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west, with much of the population living on the two coasts. Its land borders are shared with Canada to the north, and Mexico to the south. The US also shares maritime borders with Russia, Cuba, and the Bahamas. If counting the Insular Areas and Minor Outlying Islands, the United Kingdom, Samoa, and Haiti would also share maritime borders. \n The country has three major mountain ranges. The Appalachians extend from Canada to the state of Alabama, a few hundred miles west of the Atlantic Ocean. They are the oldest of the three mountain ranges and are covered with a diversity of flora and fauna, a thick canopy of dense vegetation. They offer spectacular sightseeing and excellent camping spots. The loess lands of the southern Mid-West and the Limestone cliffs and mountains of the south add beauty to the region, with lush vegetation coating the surfaces of cliff faces that border rivers, and mist shrouding beautiful green mountains and gorges. The Rockies are, on average, the tallest in North America, extending from BC, Canada to New Mexico, with many areas protected as national parks. They offer hiking, camping, skiing, and sightseeing opportunities, as well as desert and subtropical getaways in the southern lowlands of the region. The combined Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges are the youngest. The Sierras extend across the \"backbone\" of California, with sites such as Lake Tahoe and Yosemite National Park; the Sierras transition at their northern end into the even younger volcanic Cascade range, with some of the highest points in the country. \n The Great Lakes define much of the border between the eastern United States and Canada. More inland seas than lakes, they were formed by the pressure of glaciers retreating north at the end of the last Ice Age. The five lakes span hundreds of miles, bordering the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, and their shores vary from pristine wilderness areas to industrial \"rust belt\" cities. They are the second-largest bodies of freshwater in the world, after the polar ice caps. \n The western portions of the USA are rugged and contain arid landscapes, complete with wind-shaped desert sand dunes like White Sands, New Mexico. In California, Death Valley is the lowest spot on the USA mainland (282 feet below sea level) and is one of the hottest places on Earth. Natural areas include vast areas of desert untouched by humans. Camping and hiking through the majestic landscapes of the Southwest is a big vacation draw for many Americans. \n Florida is very low-lying, with long white sand beaches lining both sides of the state. The tropical climate enables many exotic (both native and non-native) plants and animals to flourish. The Florida Everglades are a pristine \"river of grass,\" made up of tropical jungles and savanna are home to 20-foot alligators and crocodiles, among many other creatures. \n The USA contains every biome on earth. The USA has something for everyone; tropical jungles, subtropical and temperate savannas, searing deserts, Mediterranean-like coast lines, frozen mountain peaks, coniferous forests, steamy subtropical river systems, and more. \n   Grand Tetons, Rocky Mountains, Wyoming \n \n\n  Time zones in USA[edit]  The United States Has a total of six time zones. \n Eastern Time Zone \n States that observes Eastern time only \n Connecticut Delaware Georgia Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire New Jersey New York North Carolina Ohio Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina Vermont Virginia West Virginia \n States that split between eastern and central: Florida Tennessee Indiana Michigan Kentucky \n Central Time Zone \n States that Observes Central Time Only \n Alabama Arkansas Illinois Iowa Louisiana Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Wisconsin \n States that Observes Central and Mountain Time Kansas Nebraska North Dakota South Dakota Oklahoma Texas \n \n Mountain Time Zone \n States that Observes Mountain Time Only \n Colorado Montana New Mexico Utah Wyoming \n States that Observes Mountain Time and Pacific Time \n Arizona* Arizona is in the Mountain Time Zone however during the summer this state observes Pacific Daylight Time.

This area of the United States has long, hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters on average. The Entire eastern half of the United States often succumbs to very hot weather during the summer with high humidity. In the southern portions of the southern states, a number of tropical-transitional climates are found, with Florida and southern Texas hosting a variety of tropical climates. The Midwest region hosts a variety of climates, from humid subtropical in the southern regions, to a warm temperate regime in the central portions, and a humid continental regimes in the more northerly areas of the region. The entire region is susceptible to extensive amount of very hot, humid weather, and more northerly regions of the Midwest often succumb to bitterly cold temperatures in the winter. \n The Plains states range from humid subtropical in swathes of Kansas and Oklahoma, to warm temperate in most of Nebraska and areas of South Dakota, to a rather harsh humid continental climate in parts of South Dakota and much of North Dakota. All border semi-arid and near desert climates that often get searingly hot and alternate between dry and humid for much of the year \n The west is largely very hot with mostly mild winters, until you get to the northern mountain regions, where, primarily due to elevation, a variety of colder highland climates exist. Most of the region consists of extremely hot or warm arid climates, with very mild to cool winters. This is an extremely rugged, mountainous region. The west coast contains a variety of hot Mediterranean climates, as well as cooler subtypes of this climate, and an oceanic maritime climate in the northwestern regions. The west coast also contains a variety of subtropical and tropical transitional climes. Parts of Arizona and New Mexico have a monsoon season which lasts from June to September. Frequent training thunderstorms often occur in this area during the summer, which can result in flooding. Dust storms can also occur, caused by downdrafts of a decaying thunderstorm. \n Florida contains a variety of tropical climates, with frequent thunderstorms and very high humidity. The climate nears the humid subtropical regime of the rest of the United States the further north in the state you travel. The humid subtropical climate regime is the predominant climate regime of the United States. \n The Great Plains are notorious for their tornado season, which lasts from March to June. These severe weather outbreaks can also cause very large hail, damaging winds, and flooding. Severe weather in the Great Plains is often forecast days in advance by meteorologists and reported by local news stations via TV and social media. \n Hawaii has a variety of tropical climates. \n Central and northern Alaska features subarctic and arctic climates with short mild summers and long very cold winters. \n The least variation of climate in the continental United States occurs during the summer, when much of the nation is warm to hot, with average highs from 80/90 F (27-32°C) weather, often reaching 100 F for many days at a time throughout many regions of the country. Desert valleys in the Western United States often see the highest temperatures in the nation, along with many days and sometimes weeks of very dry weather. San Francisco and coastal Washington have the coolest summers in the Western United States excluding alpine regions of eastern California and Colorado. The greatest difference in climate from region to region occurs during the winter season, which is mainly December to February, when temperatures can range from below 0 degrees (-18°C) in the Northern Great Plains, to a much milder 75 (24°C) in the southern regions of the country. Long stretches of below freezing temperatures are common during the winter season across the Northern Midwest and Northern Northeast, getting milder as you travel south, therefore, travelers should prepare to dress accordingly: American weather can be violent and unpredictable. \n  History[edit]   The Alamo, San Antonio, Texas \n \n\n What is now the United States was initially populated by indigenous peoples who migrated from northeast Asia. Today, their descendants are known as Native Americans, or American Indians. Although Native Americans are often portrayed as having lived a mundane and primitive lifestyle which consisted of day to day survival, the truth is that prior to European contact, the continent was densely populated by many sophisticated societies. For example, the Cherokee are descended from the Mississippian culture which built huge mounds and large towns that covered the landscape, while the Anasazi built elaborate cliff-side towns in the Southwest. As was the case in other nations in the Americas, the primitive existence attributed to Native Americans was generally the result of mass die-offs triggered by Old World diseases such as smallpox which spread like wildfire in the 15th and 16th centuries. By the time most Native American tribes directly encountered Europeans, they were a post-apocalyptic people. \n During the late 16th and 17th centuries, multiple European nations began colonizing the North American continent. Spain, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Russia established colonies in various parts of present day continental United States. Of those early settlements, it was the original British colonies in Virginia and Massachusetts that formed the cultural, political, legal and economic core of what is now the United States. \n Massachusetts was first settled by religious immigrants, known as Puritans, who later spread and founded most of the other New England colonies, creating a highly religious and idealistic region. Its neighbor to the southwest, Rhode Island, was founded by refugees from the religious fanatics of Massachusetts. Other religious groups also founded colonies, including the Quakers in Pennsylvania and Roman Catholics in Maryland. \n Virginia, on the other hand, became the most dominant of the southern colonies. Because of a longer growing season, these colonies had richer agricultural prospects, specifically cotton and tobacco. As in Central and South America, African slaves were imported and forced to cultivate in large plantations. Slavery became an important part of the economy in the South, a fact that would cause tremendous upheaval in the years to come. \n By the early 18th century, the United Kingdom had established a number of colonies along the Atlantic coast from Georgia north into what is now Canada. On July 4th, 1776, colonists from the Thirteen Colonies, frustrated with excessive taxation and micromanagement by London and encouraged by the ideals of Enlightenment philosophy, declared independence from the UK and established a new sovereign nation, the United States of America. The resulting American Revolutionary War culminated in the surrender of 7,000 British troops at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. This forced the British government to initiate peace negotiations that led to the Treaty of Paris of 1783, by which the victorious Americans assumed control of all British land south of the Great Lakes between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River. British loyalists, known as Tories, fled north of the Great Lakes into Canada, which remained stubbornly loyal to the British crown and would not become fully independent until 1982. \n Although the Thirteen Colonies had united during the war in support of the common objective of getting rid of British tyranny, most colonists' loyalties at the end of the war lay with their respective colonial governments. In turn, the young country's first attempt at establishing a national government under the Articles of Confederation was a disastrous failure. The Articles tried too hard to protect the colonies from each other by making the national government so weak it could not do anything. \n In 1787, a convention of major political leaders (the Founding Fathers of the United States) drafted a new national Constitution in Philadelphia. After ratification by a supermajority of the states, the new Constitution went into effect in 1791 and enabled the establishment of the strong federal government that has governed the United States ever since. George Washington, the commanding general of American forces during the Revolutionary War, was elected as the first President of the United States under the new Constitution. By the turn of the 19th century, a national capital had been established in Washington, D.C.. \n As American and European settlers pushed farther west, past the Appalachians, the federal government began organizing new territories and then admitting them as new states. This was enabled by the displacement and decimation of the Native American populations through warfare and disease. In what became known as the Trail of Tears, the Cherokee tribe was forcibly relocated from the Southeastern United States to present-day Oklahoma, which was known as \"Indian Territory\" until the early 20th century. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 brought French-owned territory extending from the Mississippi River to parts of the present-day Western United States under American control, effectively doubling the country's land area. \n The United States fought the War of 1812 with Britain as a reaction to British impressment of American sailors, as well as to attempt to capture parts of Canada. Though dramatic battles were fought, including one that ended with the British Army burning the White House, Capitol, and other public buildings in Washington, D.C., the war ended in a virtual stalemate. Territorial boundaries between the two nations remained nearly the same. Nevertheless, the war had disastrous consequences for the western Native American tribes that had allied with the British, with the United States acquiring more and more of their territory for white settlers. \n Florida was purchased in 1813 from Spain after the American military had effectively subjugated the region. The next major territorial acquisition came after American settlers in Texas rebelled against the Mexican government, setting up a short-lived independent republic that was absorbed into the union. The Mexican-American War of 1848 resulted in acquisition of the northern territories of Mexico, including the future states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. After 1850, the borders of the continental United States reached the rough outlines it still has today. Many Native Americans were relegated to reservations by treaty, military force, and by the inadvertent spread of European diseases transmitted by large numbers of settlers moving west along the Oregon Trail and other routes. \n Tensions between the US and the British government administering Canada continued to persist because the border west of the Great Lakes was ill-defined. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 failed to adequately address the complex geography of the region; the boundary dispute remained unsettled until 1871. \n Meanwhile, by the late 1850s, many Americans were calling for the abolition of slavery. The rapidly industrializing North, where slavery had been outlawed several decades before, favored national abolition. Southern states, on the other hand, believed that individual states had the right to decide whether or not slavery should be legal. In 1861, the Southern states, fearing domination by the North and the Republican President Nominee Abraham Lincoln, seceded from the Union and formed the breakaway Confederate States of America. These events sparked the American Civil War. To date, it is the bloodiest conflict on American soil, with over 200,000 killed in combat and a overall death toll exceeding 600,000. In 1865, Union forces prevailed, thereby cementing the federal government's authority over the states. The federal government then launched a complex process of rehabilitation and re-assimilation of the Confederacy, a period known as Reconstruction. Slavery was abolished by constitutional amendment, but the former slaves and their descendants were to remain an economic and social underclass, particularly in the South. \n The United States purchased Alaska [AK] from Russia in 1867, and the previously independent Hawaii was annexed in 1898 after a brief revolution fomented by American settlers. After decisively defeating Spain in the Spanish-American War, the United States gained its first \"colonial\" territories: Cuba (granted independence a few years later), the Philippines (granted independence shortly after World War II), Puerto Rico and Guam (which remain American dependencies today). During this \"imperialist\" phase of US history, the US also assisted Panama in obtaining independence from Colombia, as the need for a Panama Canal had become palpably clear to the US during the Spanish-American War. In 1903, the new country of Panama promptly granted the United States control over a swath of territory known as the Canal Zone. The US constructed the Panama Canal in 1914 and retained control over the Canal Zone until 1979. \n In the eastern cities of the United States, Southern and Eastern Europeans, and Russian Jews joined Irish refugees to become a cheap labor force for the country's growing industrialization. Many African-Americans fled rural poverty in the South for industrial jobs in the North, in what is now known as the Great Migration. Other immigrants, including many Scandinavians and Germans, moved to the now-opened territories in the West and Midwest, where land was available for free to anyone who would develop it. A network of railroads was laid across the country, accelerating development. \n With its entrance into World War I in 1917, the United States established itself as a world power by helping to defeat Germany and the Central Powers. However after the war, despite strong support from President Woodrow Wilson, the United States refused to join the newly-formed League of Nations, which substantially hindered that body's effectiveness in preventing future conflicts. \n Real wealth grew rapidly in the postwar period. During the Roaring Twenties, stock speculation created an immense \"bubble\" which, when it burst in October 1929, contributed to a period of economic havoc in the 1930s known as the Great Depression. The Depression was brutal and devastating, with unemployment rising to 25%. On the other hand, it helped forge a culture of sacrifice and hard work that would serve the country well in its next conflict. President Herbert Hoover lost his re-election bid in 1932 as a result of his ineffective response to the Depression. The victor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt (\"FDR\") pledged himself to a \"New Deal\" for the American people, which came in the form of a variety of aggressive economic recovery programs. While historians still debate the effectiveness of the various New Deal programs in terms of whether they fulfilled their stated objectives, it is generally undisputed that the New Deal greatly expanded the size and role of the US federal government. \n In December 1941, the Empire of Japan surprise attacked Pearl Harbor, a American military base in Hawaii, plunging the United States into World War II, a war which had already been raging in Europe for two years and in Asia since 1937. Joining the Allied Powers, the United States helped to defeat the Axis powers of Italy, Germany, and Japan. By the end of World War II, with much of Europe and Asia in ruins, the United States had firmly established itself as the dominant economic power in the world; it was then responsible for nearly half of the world's industrial production. The newly developed atomic bomb, whose power was demonstrated in two bombings of Japan in 1945, made the United States the only force capable of challenging the Communist Soviet Union, giving rise to what is now known as the Cold War. \n After World War II, America experienced an economic resurgence and growing affluence on a scale not seen since the 1920s. Meanwhile, the racism traditionally espoused in various explicit and implicit forms by the European-American majority against the country's African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, Native American, and other minority populations had become impossible to ignore. While the US was attempting to spread democracy and the rule of law abroad to counter the Soviet Union's support of authoritarian Communist governments, it found itself having to confront its own abysmal failure to provide the benefits of democracy and the rule of law to all of its own citizens. However, in the 1960s a civil rights movement emerged which eliminated some institutional discrimination against African-Americans and other ethnic minorities, particularly in the Southern states. A revived women's movement in the 1970s also led to wide-ranging changes in gender roles and perceptions in US society, including to a limited extent views on homosexuality and bisexuality. The more organized present-era US 'gay rights' movement first emerged in the late 1960s and early 70s. \n During the same period, in the final quarter of the 20th century, the United States underwent a slow but inexorable transition from an economy based on a mixture of heavy industry and labor-intensive agriculture, to an economy primarily based on advanced technology (the \"high-tech\" industry), retail, professional services, and other service industries, as well as a highly mechanized, automated agricultural industry. \n In the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, millions of US manufacturing jobs fell victim to outsourcing. In a phenomenon since labeled \"global labor arbitrage,\" revolutionary improvements in transportation, communications, and logistics technologies made it possible to relocate manufacturing of most goods to foreign factories which did not have to pay US minimum wages, observe US occupational safety standards, or allow the formation of unions. The outsourcing revolution was devastating to many cities, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast, whose economies were overly dependent upon manufacturing, and resulted in a group of hollowed-out, depressed cities now known as the Rust Belt. \n The United States also assumed and continues to maintain a position of global leadership in military and aerospace technology through the development of a powerful \"military-industrial complex\", although as of the turn of the 21st century, its leadership is increasingly being challenged by the European Union and China. US federal investments in military technology also paid off handsomely in the form of the most advanced information technology sector in the world, which is primarily centered on the area of Northern California known as Silicon Valley. US energy firms, especially those based in petroleum and natural gas, have also become global giants, as they expanded worldwide to feed the country's thirst for cheap energy. \n The 1950s saw the beginnings of a major shift of population from rural towns and urban cores to the suburbs. These population shifts, along with a changing economic climate, contributed heavily to Urban decay from the 1970s until the late 1990s. The postwar rise of a prosperous middle class able to afford cheap automobiles and cheap gasoline in turn led to the rise of the American car culture and the convenience of fast food restaurants. The Interstate Highway System, constructed primarily from the 1960s to the 1980s, became the most comprehensive freeway system in the world, at over 47,000 miles in length. It was surpassed by China only in 2011, although the US is believed to still have a larger freeway system when non-federal-aid highways are also included. \n In the late 20th century, the US was also a leader in the development and deployment of the modern passenger jetliner. This culminated in the development of the popular Boeing 737 and 747 jetliners; the 737 is still the world's most popular airliner today. Cheap air transportation together with cheap cars in turn devastated US passenger rail, although freight rail remained financially viable. In 1970, with the consent of the railroads, who were eager to focus their operations on carrying freight, Congress nationalized their passenger rail operations to form the government-owned corporation now known as Amtrak. \n During the 20th century, the US retail sector became the strongest in the world. US retailers were the first to pioneer many innovative concepts that later spread around the world, including self-service supermarkets, inventory bar codes to ease the tedium of accurately tallying purchases, \"big box\" chain stores, factory outlet stores, warehouse club stores, and modern shopping centers. American consumer culture, as well as Hollywood movies and many forms of popular music, books, and art, all combined to establish the United States as the cultural center of the world. American universities established themselves as the most prestigious academic institutions in the world, thanks to generous assistance from the federal government in the form of the GI Bill, followed by massive research and development investments by the military-industrial complex, and later, the Higher Education Act. Today, US universities are rivaled only by a handful of universities in the UK, mainland Europe, and Asia. \n  Government and politics[edit]  The United States is a federal republic comprising 50 states, the District of Columbia (Washington DC), 16 territories, and numerous Indian Reservations. The federal government derives its power from the Constitution of the United States, the oldest written constitution in the world in continuous use. Although federal law supersedes state law in the event of an express or implied conflict (known in legal jargon as \"federal preemption\"), each state is considered to be a separate sovereign, maintains its own constitution and government, and retains considerable autonomy within the federation. State citizens enjoy the power to vote for federal representatives, federal senators, and the federal President. The United States has two major political parties, the Republicans and Democrats, that dominate American politics at all levels. Due to the winner-take-all electoral system, smaller \"third parties\" as they are known to Americans are rarely competitive in any elections at any level, and the Democrats and Republicans have won every single presidential election since 1848. The Republican and Democratic dominant leads to a heavily criticized and frequently corrupt system where necessary change is too-often subject to deadlock and bi-partisan point scoring. \n Americans value their rights to political expression strongly, and politics are fiercely debated in American society. In fact, there are many popular web sites and cable channels devoted primarily to political opinion programming. American politics are very complex and change quickly. For example, gay people were not allowed to marry in any US state as recently as 2003, whereas gay marriage is now legal in all 50 states since 2015. Many Americans hold and passionately defend strong opinions on a wide range of political issues, many Americans, especially older Americans, are loyal to one party, and political debates often become heated and lead to insults, vulgarities, and personal attacks being exchanged. For these reasons, unless you are intimately familiar with American politics or already know and agree with the political views of the person you are talking to, you are best off not talking about politics at all!\n American elections are frequent and lengthy, especially the presidential election. Presidential elections in the United States last nearly two years, so there is a 50% chance that you will be visiting the United States in the midst of one. The November election is preceded by a six-month period from January to June wherein all 50 states, 5 overseas territories, and D.C. each vote one-by-one twice; one time to select the Republican nominee, and the other to select the Democratic nominee. One of these two nominees will be elected President in November. The current president is Donald Trump. He was elected in November 2016 and sworn in on January 2017. Federal elections for Congressional positions take place every two years in November. \n Compared to Western European Democracies, there are an extraordinary number of elected positions in the United States. On a single election day, there might be simultaneous elections for dozens of positions. Typically, the average American would be voting for school board members, city councilmen, mayors, deputy mayors, governors, state representatives, state senators, congressmen, senators, the president, and a number of other positions, such as tax assessor or coroner. \n The President of the United States is elected indirectly every four years and serves as the head of government and head of state. Each state is allocated electoral votes, and whichever candidate gets the most votes in a state get all of that state's electoral votes. Though rare, this means that a candidate can win the \"electoral vote\" and thus the presidency while gaining fewer popular votes than his opponent. Most recently, this happened in the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. \n The Congress is bicameral; the lower House of Representatives has seats assigned to the states proportionally, while the upper house, the Senate, comprises exactly two seats per state. \n By way of contrast, the District of Columbia and the overseas territories have limited federal representation, as they can only elect \"delegates\" to the federal House of Representatives who cannot participate in votes by the Committee of the Whole on the House floor. (D.C. does, however, get three electoral votes with respect to the election of the federal President.) Because they lack state sovereignty, the governments of D.C. and the territories exist at the mercy of the federal government, which theoretically could dissolve them at any time. \n The laws and legal systems of the U.S. will be complicated at best to understand and follow. State and territorial laws can vary widely from one jurisdiction to another, meaning that the US actually consists of at least 54 separate legal systems with regard to any area of law not within the purview of federal law. State and territorial laws are quite uniform in some areas (e.g., contracts for sales of goods) and extremely divergent in others (e.g., \"real estate,\" the American term for immovable property). If this was not confusing enough, sovereign Native American tribes are allowed to operate their own legal systems separate from both federal and state law. What's more, the U.S. federal government practices the use of Federal Enclaves. Which are pieces of land or properties owned by the Federal government under a agreement of the state or territory. A example are U.S. national forests. As Federal owned land and property, most state and territorial laws do not apply. Examples are state and territorial anti-discrimination, minimum wage, and criminal laws. While state and territorial laws such as juvenile delinquency, restraining order laws still apply. \n The federal government consists of the President of the United States and his administration acting as the executive branch, the United States Congress acting as the legislative branch, and the Supreme Court of the United States and lower federal courts acting as the judicial branch. State government structures are organized similarly, with governors, legislatures, and judiciaries. \n  Culture[edit]   The South's famous Bourbon Street, New Orleans, Louisiana \n \n\n The United States is made up of many diverse ethnic groups and its culture varies greatly across the vast area of the country and even within cities - a city like New York will have dozens, if not hundreds, of different ethnicities represented within a neighborhood. Despite this difference, there exists a strong sense of national identity and certain predominant cultural traits. Generally, Americans tend to believe strongly in personal responsibility and that an individual determines his or her own success or failure, but it is important to note that there are many exceptions and that a nation as diverse as the United States has literally thousands of distinct cultural traditions. One will find South Carolina in the South to be different culturally from New Hampshire in New England. \n  Holidays[edit]  The United States has a number of holidays — official and/or cultural — of which the traveler should be aware of. Note that holidays observed on Mondays or Fridays are usually treated as weekend-long events. (A weekend consists of a Saturday and a Sunday.) Federal holidays — i.e., holidays observed by the federal government, state and local government and banks — are indicated in bold italics. If a federal holiday with a fixed calendar date (such as Independence Day) falls on a weekend, federal and most state and local government offices will be closed on the nearest non-weekend day. Since the early 1970s, several federal holidays, including Memorial Day and Labor Day, have been observed on a certain Monday rather than on a fixed date for the express purpose of giving federal employees three-day weekends. Foreign embassies &amp; consulates in the U.S. also observe the same federal holidays (in bold italics) in addition to the official holidays of their respective countries. The private sector (besides banks) are usually open for business on most holidays with people working except New Years, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, the Friday after Thanksgiving and Christmas when a vast number of non-retail businesses do close or open partial hours in observance. \n Due to the number of major holidays in close proximity to each other, many Americans refer to the period between Thanksgiving in late November and New Year's Day as simply \"the holidays.\" School and work vacations are commonly taken during this periods: \n From a foreign traveler's point of view, there are two major services affected by federal holidays: visas and mail. \n First, if you are a foreigner who needs to apply for a US visa, it is important to note the federal holidays marked in bold italics. All US embassies worldwide close on those days, in addition to the official holidays of the host country and are unable to process applications on those days. \n Second, United States Postal Service retail counters are closed on federal holidays, and in high-crime areas, the entire post office stays closed. Self-service kiosks at post offices in relatively safe areas with 24/7 lobby access remain operational through holidays. However, mail deposited at a post office or in a mailbox will not be processed until after the holiday is over. \n Other federal services like national parks and airport security operate 365 days a year regardless of federal holidays. \n Many state governments also observe official holidays of their own which are not observed in other states or by the federal government. \n  Units of measure[edit]  The United States is the only industrialized country that has still not adopted metric units of measure in daily life (it still uses the customary English units that were in use prior to the revolution, similar to the later British imperial system, but typically with smaller units as one of the major differences), except for scientific, engineering, medical, and military applications. \n All road signs and speed limits are posted in miles and miles per hour respectively. Automotive fuel is priced and sold per gallon, which is 128 fluid ounces, 80% of the size of an Imperial/UK gallon. Other capacities of liquid products are normally quoted and sold per gallon, quart, or ounce (although liters are often indicated and sometimes exclusively used, as with some soda, wine, and other liquor products). Temperatures are reported in Fahrenheit only; 32 degrees (with units unspecified) is the temperature at which water freezes (equivalent to 0 degrees Celsius). The good news is that most cars on the road in the US have both mph and km/h marked on their speedometers (good for trips to Canada and Mexico), and almost all groceries and household items sold in stores are labeled in both systems. The vast majority of Americans, though, have little day-to-day exposure to the metric system (apart from having studied it a little in school) and will assume some understanding of customary measures. \n In addition, the US government does not regulate apparel or shoe sizes. Although there are informal standard sizes, they are not strictly enforced. The only thing you can count on is that sizes tend to be consistent within the same brand. If you plan to shop for apparel or shoes, you will have to do some trial-and-error for each brand to determine what fits, because you cannot rely on any brand's sizes as equivalent to another's. Please note that, as the average body size of Americans tends to be larger than that of those living in other countries, a concept known as vanity sizing (the labeling of larger garments with smaller sizes) exists in many clothing retailers, especially those aimed at women. It is very possible for people with smaller body types to have some difficulty finding suitably sized clothing. \n  Electricity[edit]  For more information: Electrical systems  Electricity in the United States is provided to consumers in the form of 120V, 60Hz alternating current, through wall outlets that take NEMA 1 or NEMA 5 plugs. (NEMA stands for National Electrical Manufacturers Association.) NEMA 1 plugs have two flat, blunt blades (don't worry, they're not sharp), one of which may or may not be polarized (slightly larger than the other), to ensure that the hot and neutral blades are inserted correctly for devices for which that matters. NEMA 5 plugs add a round grounding pin below the blades. All US buildings constructed or renovated after the early 1960s are required to have three-hole outlets that accept the two blades and one pin of NEMA 5 plugs, as well as both polarized and unpolarized NEMA 1 two-blade plugs. The US Virgin Islands uses a slightly lower voltage of 110V. American Samoa uses US plugs, the German Schuko plug, and the Australian standard plug. \n All of North America, nearly all of the Caribbean and Central America, Venezuela, and Taiwan follow US standards for electricity and plugs. If you are arriving from outside of those areas, you will need to verify whether your electrical devices are compatible with US electricity and plugs. Japan uses the same plugs as the US, but has a unique standard of 100V with frequency of either 50 or 60Hz depending on region. Most of the rest of the world uses 220-230V at 50Hz, for the simple reason that they began large-scale electrification at much later dates than the US and after wire insulation technology had significantly advanced. This meant they could select a higher voltage and lower frequency, which required less conductor material (meaning less use of expensive metals) but at the expense of more insulation and larger, more heavily insulated plugs. Colombia's voltage is 110V and Ecuador's 120-127V but the frequency is the same as the US. \n Most consumer electronics, computers, and shavers are already designed as \"dual voltage\" devices capable of accepting voltages from 110V up to 230V and between 50-60Hz. For those devices, a plug adapter is sufficient. Purchase your adapter at home before you depart. Most US stores carry adapters designed to adapt NEMA plugs to other countries' outlets, not the other way around. \n The differences in voltage and frequency are most frequently an issue for travellers with hair long enough to require the use of a hair dryer for proper hair care. Foreign visitors regularly find their hair dryers to be starved for power in the US; conversely, Americans' hair dryers are regularly burned out and destroyed by high voltages overseas. Apart from doing without or waiting an annoying long time to dry one's hair, the solutions are to either \n  buy a high-wattage transformer capable of stepping up 120V to 220V\n buy a hair dryer with a switch that allows it to be switched between 110 and 220V\n buy a cheap US hair dryer for use during your trip; or \n book hotels that cater to international travellers and place hair dryers in the rooms for this reason.\n   For more information[edit]  The US federal government sets foreign policy, while the states deal with tourism. As such, the federal government provides the best information about legal requirements for entry, while information about places to visit and see is best provided by state and local tourism bureaus. Contact information is available in the individual state articles. At state borders, highway rest stops sometimes feature visitor centers and often offer travel and tourism information and materials, almost all of which is also available on-line or can be requested in advance by mail. Nearly every rest stop has a posted road map with a clearly indicated \"You Are Here\" marker. Some also offer free paper road maps to take with you. \n Note that government tourism bureaus and their Web sites tend to be rather indiscriminate in their recommendations, since for political reasons they cannot be seen as overly favorable towards any particular area within their jurisdiction. \n  Regions[edit]  The United States is composed of 50 states, various overseas territories, as well as the city of Washington, D.C., a federal district and the nation's capital. Below is a rough grouping of these states into regions, from the Atlantic to the Pacific: \n   Map of the USA\n \n\n    New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont)\nHome to gabled churches, rustic antiques, and steeped in American history, New England offers beaches, spectacular seafood, rugged mountains, frequent winter snows, and some of the nation's oldest cities, in a territory small enough to tour (hastily) in a week. The small town environments have managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy for centuries.      Mid-Atlantic (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia)\nRanging from New York in the north to Washington, D.C., the Mid-Atlantic is home to some of the nation's most densely populated cities, as well as historic sites, rolling mountains, the New Jersey Pine Barrens, the Lehigh Valley, and seaside resorts like the Long Island beaches and the Jersey Shore. Bridging New England and the steamy South, the Mid-Atlantic includes some of the most cosmopolitan areas in the world as well as small enclaves of American history, natural beauty, including lush river passes and low-lying mountains. The climate is humid subtropical, albeit with cooler winters than in the south.      South (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, Tennessee)\nThe South is celebrated for its hospitality, down-home cooking and its blues, jazz, rock 'n' roll, and country music traditions. A distinct literature, accents, and religiosity help distinguish Southerners as well. This lush, largely subtropical region includes cool, verdant mountains, waterfalls, cave systems hidden in vegetation, mist-shrouded limestone cliffs, alligators, tropical microclimates, tropical and subtropical fruit and crop growing, ring-tailed cats, southern flying squirrels, possums, snakes, and armadillos, agricultural plantations of cotton and sugarcane, vast cypress swamps, and long, white sand, palm tree studded beaches.      Florida\nFlorida, hosting a variety of tropical climates, is a vacationers paradise. Here, you'll find resort destinations and giant theme parks in the central portion, and white sand beaches on both coasts. Southern Florida and Caribbean-influenced Miami and Key West is home to tropical rainforests and savannas and warm sandy beaches. An extremely popular tourist attraction, Florida includes some of the nicest attractions that the United States has to offer and is conveniently located in the Caribbean, facilitating travel to exotic islands. Florida's collection of tropical jungles, blue waters, coral reefs, and exotic wildlife are sure to excite any vacationer.      Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin)\nThe Midwest is home to farmland, forests, picturesque towns, industrial cities, and the Great Lakes, the largest system of freshwater lakes in the world, forming the North Coast of the US. Midwesterners are known for their straight-forwardness and hospitality. Explore soft dune fields along vast blue lakes, lakeside caves, huge caves shrouded in dense vegetation, natural getaways full of interesting rock formations and waterfalls, and enjoy the many hours of fun to be had in boats on lakes and rivers the region over. The southern portion, with its subtropical fertile loess-lands full of jungle-y cypress swamps and unique wildlife, is distinct from the northern portion, with its harsher continental climes, coniferous-forested lake islands, and big game.      Texas\nThe second biggest state in the nation is like a separate country (and in fact, briefly was), with strong cultural influences from its Spanish and Mexican past. The state is also a nexus of Southwestern and Southern cultures. The terrain ranges from southeastern subtropical jungles and savannas, to the cattle-ranching, rugged South Plains, to the sandy beaches of South Texas, to the mountains and hot deserts of West Texas. Explore a mangrove forest, climb a rugged mountain while glaring at alien flora and fauna, descend slowly down a river amidst soaring canyon walls, or lay back on a sun-soaked beach.      Great Plains (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma)\nTravel westward through these supposedly flat states, from the edge of the eastern forests through the prairies and onto the High Plains, an enormous expanse steppes (short grass prairies) nearly as desolate as in the frontier days. Explore the lunar-like badlands, get comfortable in a wild-west town in the middle of the Black Hills, climb the otherworldly red mountains of Oklahoma, gaze at the bizarre chalk and sandstone formations, discover oddities such as grass covered sand dunes, discover animals such as rattlesnakes, coyotes, prairie dogs, and pronghorn antelope, or witness some of the wildest, most dangerous, and most beautiful weather spectacles in the world.      Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Montana, Wyoming)\nThe spectacular snow-covered Rockies offer hiking, rafting, and excellent snow skiing as well as deserts, subtropical lowlands, continental highlands, and some large cities. This is one of the highest altitude regions on earth. Tourist cities include some of the nicest amenities for hundreds of miles and some parts of the Rockies are virtually untouched by man. Hot springs, hanging lakes, geysers and geothermal features, red deserts, huge sand dunes, mini-rainforests, warmer getaway destinations, these mountain states have it all.      Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah)\nHeavily influenced by Spanish and Mexican culture, this area is home to some of the nation's most spectacular natural attractions and some flourishing artistic communities. Although mostly empty, the region's hot deserts have some of the nation's largest cities such as Phoenix. Las Vegas is home to gambling and shows. Additionally, a strong Native American influence can be felt throughout as this region includes many large reservations and sovereign territorial lands. The alien landscape looks as if it were mars, the creatures that inhabit this region, large and small, are vicious and fascinating, and with endless amounts of soaring canyons, meteor craters, canyon-side cliff dwellings, white sand dunes, salt flats, and giant mountains, this region is sure to entertain for days.      California\nLike the Southwest, California has a history under Spanish and Mexican rule and is heavily influenced by Spanish and Mexican culture in addition to massive immigration from around the world. California offers world-class cities, deserts, rainforests, geothermal features, Mediterranean coastlines, snowy mountains, and beautiful beaches. Northern California (above the San Francisco Bay Area) and Southern California (below the San Francisco Bay Area) are culturally distinct.      Pacific Northwest (Washington, Idaho, Oregon)\nThe Pacific Northwest offers outdoor pursuits as well as cosmopolitan cities. The terrain ranges from spectacular temperate rain forests to scenic mountains and volcanoes to beautiful coastlines, to Mediterranea-type beaches and coastline, to sage-covered steppes and deserts. In minutes, you can travel from a high-tech metropolis to a thick forest or a mountaintop.      Alaska\nOne-fifth as large as the rest of the United States, Alaska reaches well into the Arctic, and features mountainous wilderness. The state has a rich and diverse tapestry of native cultures including Yupik, Inupiat, Tlingit and others. Around 15% of the residents are of native origin.      Hawaii\nA volcanic archipelago in the tropical Pacific, 2,300 miles south west of California (the nearest state), laid-back Hawaii is a vacation paradise. With beautiful cliffs, jungles, waterfalls, and beaches, its definitely a place to unwind. The indigenous Polynesian population are known for being accommodating and fun-loving.   \n Politically, the US is a federation of states, each with its own rights and powers (hence the name). The US also administers a motley collection of non-state territories around the world, the largest of which are Puerto Rico (which has the special status of a \"commonwealth\") and the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean plus American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands (also has special status of a \"commonwealth\") in Oceania, along with many others. \n  Cities[edit]   White House south façade, Washington, DC\n \n\n The United States has over 10,000 cities, towns, and villages. The following is a list of just ten of the most notable. Other cities can be found in their corresponding regions. \n  Other destinations[edit]   The Grand Canyon, Arizona \n \n\n These are some of the largest and most famous destinations outside of major cities: \n  Get in[edit]   \n  Visa Restrictions:\nOn June 26, 2018 the United States Supreme Court upheld President Trump's Presidential Proclamation 9645, allowing it to go into effect. President Trump's Presidential Proclamation 9645 bars entry of peoples from Iran, Somalia, Libya, Yemen, North Korea, Syria and certain government officials from Venezuela. \n  \n \n There is no airside transit without US entry between international flights. All travelers must disembark and proceed through immigration and customs inspection to enter the United States at first port entry, even if you're only staying for the two to four hours needed to transit between flights. This is most relevant if you're transiting between Asia or Europe to/from Latin America. Therefore, all travelers must be able to enter the United States on the Visa Waiver Program (or other visa exemption) or obtain a visitor's (B1 or B2) or transit (C1) visa. See below. \n  Law and bureaucracy[edit]  The US federal government has five separate agencies with jurisdiction over visitors. \n The most important one from a visitor's perspective is Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a bureau of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The CBP's Office of Field Operations operates 20 Field Operations offices which supervise immigration and customs inspection stations at over 320 ports of entry. All travelers entering the United States must undergo immigration and customs inspection to ensure lawful entry. All US citizens and nationals and visitors who can qualify for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) (as explained further below) generally encounter only CBP officers. \n If you cannot enter the US through the VWP, you must visit a US Embassy or Consulate to apply for and obtain a visa, which will require a short visa interview with a US consular officer. \n If you attempt to unlawfully cross a US land border at any other point besides a port of entry, you may encounter the U.S. Border Patrol, which is also part of CBP. \n If you attempt to unlawfully come ashore in the US from a body of water at any other point besides a port of entry, you may encounter the U.S. Coast Guard, which is normally part of DHS (but can operate as part of the Department of Defense in wartime). \n Finally, if you unlawfully enter the US, commit a severe crime in the US, or overstay your visa, you will likely encounter officers from the division of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), another DHS bureau. ICE operates a system of immigration detention facilities. Strict compliance with US law during your stay is strongly recommended. \n  Planning and pre-arrival documentation[edit]   Visa-free entry[edit]  Citizens of the 38 countries within the Visa Waiver Program, as well as Canadians, Mexicans living on the border (holding a Border Crossing Card), Bermudians, Cayman, and Turks and Caicos Islanders (with British Overseas Territories passports) generally do not require advance visas for entry into the United States. However, the requirements for Guam, the Marianas Islands, and American Samoa are different and are listed below. \n For Canadians and Bermudians, the entry period is normally for a maximum of six months. However, entry may still be refused on the basis of a criminal record. Those who have criminal records should seek out a US embassy for advice on whether they need a visa. \n For travelers under the Visa Waiver Program, the entry period is strictly limited to 90 days (see additional requirements below). \n As of July 2016, the countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program areAndorra, Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brunei, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. \n Citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau may enter, reside, study, and work in the US indefinitely with only a valid passport. \n Citizens of the Bahamas may apply for visa-free entry only at the US Customs pre-clearance facilities in the Bahamas to the States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, but a valid police certificate may be required for those over the age of 14. Attempting to enter through any other port of entry, whether by land, sea, or air, requires a valid visa. However, Bahamaian citizens are not exempted from visa requirements for traveling to American Samoa. \n Persons holding a passport from the Cayman Islands, if they intend to travel directly to the US from there, may obtain a single-entry visa waiver for about $25 prior to departure. If traveling by air or cruise ship, a police certificate will be needed to travel to the States, Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Northern Mariana Islands. This is the same for holders of British Virgin Islands or Turks and Caicos Islands passports. However, passport holders of the British Virgin Islands do not need a police certificate to travel to the U.S. Virgin Islands as only a passport will be needed. \n  Visa Waiver Program requirements[edit]  Travel under the Visa Waiver Program is limited to transit, tourism, or business purposes only; neither study, employment, nor journalism is permitted under the VWP. The 90-day limit cannot be extended nor will travel to Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean reset the 90-day limit. Take care if transiting through the US on a trip exceeding 90 days to Canada and/or Mexico. \n Travelers entering the US under the VWP and arriving by air or sea must apply for Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) approval on-line before travel, preferably 72 hours before travel. An ESTA approval is valid for two years (unless your passport expires earlier) and costs $14 (payable by credit card). If granted, it allows the traveler to commence their journey to the US but (as with any visa or entry permit) it does not guarantee entry. \n Entry under the Visa Waiver Program by air or sea also requires that you are using a signatory carrier. It is a fairly safe assumption that commercial scheduled services to the US will be fine, but if you are on a chartered flight or vessel you should check the status of the carrier, as you may require a visa. \n Travelers entering by air or sea must also have a return/onward ticket out of the United States. If the return/onward ticket terminates in Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, or any Caribbean island, the traveler must be a legal resident of that country/territory. If travelling by land, there is a $7.00 fee when crossing the border. \n A criminal record, including arrests, will generally make a potential traveler ineligible for visa-free travel with the following exceptions: \n The ESTA application contains a questionnaire, which if answered truthfully will direct you to apply to a visa if you are ineligible for the Visa Waiver Program for reasons of criminal history, etc. If you have any concerns, complete the ESTA application well in advance of your departure to allow time to apply for a visa if directed to do so. \n Effective as of 2016, any person who is a citizen of both a VWP country and of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria, or a citizen of a VWP country and who has visited any of those four countries since March 2011 is ineligible to enter the United States under the Visa Waiver Program. \n There are disadvantages and restrictions to entering under the Visa Waiver Program. Under normal circumstances, these include the following: \n  Obtaining a visa[edit]  Common US Visa/Residence Statuses\n\n For the rest of the world, or for those who don't fit the profile of a Visa Waiver Program entry (e.g., need to stay more than 90 days) the visa application fee is a non-refundable $160 (as of April 2012) for visas that are not issued on the basis of a petition (ex. business, tourist, transit, student, and journalist) and $190 for those that are (employment). This fee is sometimes waived under very limited circumstances, namely for people requesting certain exchange visitor visas. \n Under US law, all persons requesting entry as non-immigrants are presumed to be immigrants (that is, trying to permanently migrate) until they overcome that presumption by presenting evidence of \"binding ties\" to their home country as well as sufficient proof that the visit will be temporary. To obtain a visa, face-to-face interviews at the nearest US embassy or consulate are required for nearly all nationalities. When the US rejects a visa application, it is usually because the applicant did not show enough binding ties to his or her home country to convince the consular officer that they will not try to overstay their visa. Since waits for interview slots and visa processing can add up to several months, you must start researching how to obtain a visa well in advance of your planned departure date. If you do not live close to a US consulate, you will need to set aside a day (or two) to travel to the closest consulate for the visa interview. \n For technical and scientific fields of work or study, processing a non-immigrant visa application can take up to 70 days, as it can require eight weeks to receive approval from authorities in Washington. This especially applies to military and dual-purpose fields which are mentioned in a so-called technical alert list. \n Note that a visa does not guarantee entry into the US. It only authorizes you to proceed to a port of entry and request admission. Be sure you apply for the right visa for your visit. Applying for the incorrect/inappropriate visa may lead to serious legal problems, as well as a possible indefinite bar from obtaining any US visa. \n  Statue of Liberty, New York City \n \n\n  Travel to US possessions[edit]  The territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands all have the same entry requirements as the 50 states. Although, the COFA nations aren't considered part of the U.S. and are independent countries, the U.S. maintains and exersises some extent of jurisdiction over the countries so the countries are somewhat US possessions, which is why they are included here as US possessions. \n  Guam-Northern Mariana Islands[edit]  Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands allow entry, by air only, for an additional group of foreign nationals under the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program: Brunei, Malaysia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan (only on non-stop flights from Taiwan), and Hong Kong. Citizens of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, and the United Kingdom are also allowed entry under the Guam-CNMI VWP and may enter either under that or the federal VWP. Entrance under the Guam-CNMI VWP requires a valid, machine-readable passport and evidence of a return airfare, and is limited to a 45-day stay in Guam and the CNMI only. Residents of Hong Kong must present a valid HK permanent identity card and are allowed entry with either a Hong Kong S.A.R. passport or British National (Overseas) passport. Residents of Taiwan must present a valid R.O.C. National Identification Card in addition to an R.O.C. passport. Citizens of Russia are eligible for parole (essentially the same as visa-free travel) to enter the Northern Marianas Islands only. Because of differences in entry requirements, a full immigration check is done when traveling between Guam and the CNMI as well as on flights to the rest of the US (currently, only Guam-Hawaii flights). \n Despite not being part of the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program, citizens of Russia can enter both territories Guam-CNMI visa-free under the waiver program, as long as they are in possession of a machine-readable passport, a completed Form I-736 (Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Information form) and Form I-94 (Arrival-Departure Record) and a non-refundable and non-transferable return ticket. \n Citizens of China will need a visa to enter Guam, but not one to enter the Northern Mariana Islands. Citizens will need to be in possession of a machine-readable passport, completed Form I-736 (Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Information form) and Form I-94 (Arrival-Departure Record) may enter the CNMI only visa-free for up to 45 days (travel to Guam still requires applying for a visa in advance). \n US and American Samoan citizens must have a passport as proof of citizenship for entry to Guam and the CNMI. However, US and American Samoan citizens can live, work, and travel freely in both territories. \n  American Samoa[edit]  American Samoa lies outside federal immigration jurisdiction and has separate entry requirements, which even apply to US citizens. Entry is allowed for 30 days (extendable to 60 days) for tourism with a valid passport and proof of onward travel or local employment. Nationals from the following countries can visit American Samoa for tourist purposes only visa-free for up to 30 days; Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brunei, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Palau, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. However, a entry permit will be issued upon arrival. Entry requirements are somewhat different for Americans with US citizenship. US citizens are required to have only a six month valid passport, a entry ticket, and a exit ticket. US citizens can live, work, and travel freely for a unlimited time in American Samoa. \n  Puerto Rico-US Virgin Islands[edit]  Both Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands choose to follow the Mainland US entry requirements. As with the Mainland, any non-US citizen who is eligible may enter under the Visa Waiver Program. American and American Samoan citizens don't need a passport nor visa to travel to both Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Only some form of government ID (example; a driver's license) is needed for proof of citizenship. Any US and American Samoan citizen can live, work and travel freely for a unlimited time in both territories. \n  COFA nations[edit]  US citizens and citizens of countries under the federal Visa Waiver Program plus Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia are allowed visa-free entry. And can reside and work anywhere in the United States for a unlimited time. All other foreign nationals must contact the American Samoa Attorney General's office to obtain a visa at (684) 633-4163. \n  US Minor Outlying Islands[edit]  All foreign, US and American Samoan citizens must have special travel permits to travel to all uninhabited territories that make up the US Minor Outlying Islands. \n  Arriving in the United States[edit]  Before arrival, if you are not a Canadian or Bermudian, you will receive either a white I-94 (if entering with a visa) or green I-94W (if entering on a visa waiver) form to complete. For visitors travelling under the Visa Waiver Program arriving by air, the I-94W has now been replaced by the electronic ESTA system; therefore the form is not required. Again, remember that the ESTA approval is in essence, a permit to travel - not a guarantee of entry, hence there is no need to produce a copy of it at passport control - had there been any problems you would have been denied boarding at your origin airport, however most travelers tend to keep a copy of it in their possession anyway, just in case. \n I-94 forms are now used primarily at land ports of entry. As October 2013, the I-94 paper form is now optional for virtually all visitors arriving by common carrier at air and sea ports of entry. CBP now has arrangements in place to electronically receive manifest information directly from all major common carriers. From the manifests, CBP's computers create and maintain electronic I-94 records for all passengers who are foreign visitors. CBP operates a Web site where visitors may view their own electronic I-94 record while they are still in the United States. \n When you reach a CBP immigration checkpoint, you will undergo a short interview if you are not a citizen or resident of the United States. A CBP officer will attempt to determine if the purpose of your visit is valid. Usually, the determination of admissibility is made in a minute or less. \n Otherwise, you may be referred to further questioning in a more private area. At that stage the CBP officers will likely search your possessions, and may read any documents, letters or diaries found in your possession. Do not bring anything that could imply you intend to permanently immigrate or otherwise violate the terms of your visa. For example, you should not be carrying work-related or sales materials if you are entering on a tourist visa. If you are unable to convince the CBP officers that you will abide by the terms of your visa (or VWP ESTA authorization if applicable), it can be cancelled on the spot, and you will be denied entry. \n Like immigration,customs and law enforcement officials everywhere, CBP officials take all security threats seriously.Making any joke could result in a lenghty interrogation, prison sentence or turned back to your country of origin. \n For non-residents, your entry forms will need to state the street address of the location where you will be staying for the first night. This should be arranged in advance. The name of your hotel, hostel, university, etc. is not sufficient; you must provide the street name and number. \n Once you are admitted, the departure portion of your I-94 or I-94W will be stapled to your passport (if you were required to fill it out). Keep it safe as you will need to give it CBP upon departure from the US. In the alternative, even if you weren't required to fill out a I-94, the CBP officer will place an admission stamp in your passport which shows that you were admitted to the United States under a certain class and until a certain date. \n For most travellers entering on visitor status (B1 or B2), you will normally be granted permission to stay for up to six months. Travellers entering under the VWP will receive permission to remain for 90 days only. If you enter under a student (F) or exchange visitor (J) status, your permitted duration of stay will normally be indicated as D/S, which means \"permitted to remain provided status as a student/exchange visitor is maintained\". \n  At customs[edit]  All travelers entering the US (including US citizens, nationals, and permanent residents) must fill out the Customs Declaration form, CBP Form 6059B, a blue-colored form in the shape of a tall narrow rectangle. It used to be distributed on the plane, but some airlines now hand it out at check-in for flights to the US. Many airports now have electronic kiosks that have replaced the physical Customs Declaration form. You still must answer the same questions as you would on the traditional form, but instead the machine will print out a receipt that you will present along with your passport to the customs agent. \n If you are traveling with family members, then only one form per family is required to be filled out. Normally, the head of the family is responsible for ensuring the declaration is accurate. \n The Customs Declaration form asks you to declare whether you are bringing with you a variety of heavily regulated items, such as more than USD10,000 in cash. In addition, you must list on the back side all goods that you are permanently bringing into the US and leaving there (such as foreign gifts for US-based friends and family). The Form 6059B is notorious for not having enough space on the back, so ask for and fill out multiple forms if you have many items to declare. \n After you are admitted into the US and retrieve your bags from the baggage claim, you will proceed to the secondary inspection area (the customs checkpoint), regardless of whether your journey terminates at this airport or if you are transiting onward via another flight. Hand your customs declaration to the officer. Most of the time, the officer will point you to the exit and that will be it. \n Sometimes, the officer may ask you a few routine questions and then let you go. The officer may refer you to an adjacent X-ray machine to have your bags inspected or may refer you for a manual hand search of your bags. Any search more intrusive than a bag search is rare and is usually indicated only if some sort of probable cause has been established through questioning or during the bag search to suggest suspicious activity. \n Note that you can't bring meat or raw fruit or vegetables, but you may bring cooked non-meat packaged foods, such as bread, cookies, and other baked goods. See APHIS for details. The US Customs process is straightforward. Most articles that are prohibited or restricted in any other country are prohibited or restricted in the US. One rule that is unique to America is that it is generally prohibited to bring in goods made in countries on which the US has imposed economic sanctions such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea (DPRK) and Syria. \n The US possessions of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas Islands, and the US Virgin Islands are all outside federal customs jurisdiction. Each imposes their own separate requirements. Travel between these regions and the rest of the US requires a customs inspection. There are some differences (mostly larger) in duty exemptions for US citizens returning from these destinations. \n  After customs[edit]  As noted above, all inbound citizens, nationals, and visitors must pass through immigration and customs at their first point of entry, regardless of whether they have onward connections to other destinations inside or outside the US or not. Many major airports have special arrangements for travellers with connecting flights such as a bag drop, check-in counter or security checkpoint just for the use of connecting passengers (you will need to re-clear security because you had access to your bags while passing through customs) upon coming out from customs inspection. Some airports do not, meaning that you will need to proceed to the main check-in desks with other departing passengers. \n  Closed cities[edit]   The closed-off town of Mercury\n \n\n If you managed to get into the United States visa-free or not, if you plan on visiting rural Nevada, be careful on where you are. There is a closed city in Nevada called Mercury which the town was involved in nuclear testing programs by the U.S. government, something it no longer conducts. This city, like many other closed cities, is closed off to the public, including foreigners. You will need special permission from the U.S. government in order to enter the town. Attempting to enter without the permission will get you arrested. \n  Leaving the United States (and re-entering from Canada or Mexico)[edit]   \n Thinking of Overstaying or Violating Status?: Make sure you leave before the authorized period of stay indicated in your I-94 form (not your visa) expires. If you overstay the period granted at passport control or violate your terms of entry (e.g., work while present as a visitor), this will automatically invalidate your visa and you'll no longer have a valid immigration status. In addition, overstaying your authorized stay or violating the conditions will make it extremely difficult to re-enter the United States for any purpose, and this may, in some cases, bar you from re-entry for at least three years, if not permanently. If you entered under the Visa Waiver Program but overstayed, you will need a visa for all future visits. Even if you did not technically overstay each of your visits, if officers suspect or detect a pattern with your previous visits/travel history that suggests you are in fact spending more time in the US than your home country (e.g. you leave the US only to return there a few weeks later), you may also face severe questioning the next time you arrive. \n \n \n\n Unlike most countries, the US does not provide formal passport control checkpoints for those exiting the country. This used to be a big problem for many tourists who left by air or sea, but is not a major issue any more. Since CBP now receives manifests automatically from all major common carriers, CBP can automatically update their electronic I-94 records to show you timely departed from the United States as long as you leave on a common carrier (like a major airline). \n Otherwise, if you are leaving the US for the last time on a particular trip (e.g., not returning from Canada or Mexico), it is ultimately your responsibility to turnover the departure record of your I-94 or I-94(W) to CBP at the Canadian or Mexican borders if leaving by land. \n  By plane[edit]    Seattle skyline, Washington state, Pacific Northwest \n \n\n Most visitors from outside Canada and Mexico arrive in the United States by plane. While many medium-sized inland cities have an international airport, there are limited flights to most of them. Most travellers enter the US at one of the major entry points along the coasts: \n Luggage allowance for flights to or from the US usually operates on a piecewise system in addition to the weight system even for foreign carriers. This means that you are allowed a limited number of bags to check-in where each bag should not exceed certain linear dimensions (computed by adding the length, width and height of the bags). The exact allowances and restrictions on weight, linear dimension and number of baggage allowed are determined by the carrier you are flying with, your origin (if coming to the US) or destination (if leaving the US) and the class of service you are traveling in. \n  Airport security[edit]  International flights bound for the United States tend to feature extremely strict security. Besides going through a regular security search to enter the departure area of the airport terminal, it was standard up until 2015 at many airports to have an additional layer of security around waiting areas for gates for US-bound flights with a secondary security checkpoint of its own. While that kind of security is no longer seen at many airports, all airlines with US-bound flights continue to carefully inspect all documents at time of boarding. Passengers may be selected for the Secondary Security Screening Selection (or \"SSSS\"), which randomly selects passengers on inbound flights to the US (although it is applied to internal flights also) for additional security screening. Passengers are typically stopped at the jetway prior to boarding, and their carry on bags are hand searched, portable electronic devices must be charged and powered on for inspection, and shoes/socks will be swabbed. The first sign that this may happen to you is that an electronic boarding pass will be denied, or you will be referred to an agent if you use a self check-in machine at the airport. If the letters \"SSSS\" are printed on your boarding card when you eventually get it, then it means you have been selected - so be prepared for the additional screening. \n Within the US, airport security procedures continue to evolve. The TSA (Transportation Security Administration) now requires all passengers to remove shoes and outerwear (coats and jackets) and submit those items along with all personal belongings to X-ray screening. Laptops and large cameras must be removed from bags and scanned separately. \n Full body scanning x-ray machines are now in use at many US airports, which are capable of detecting many non-metallic threats. Because of early problems with displaying far too much detail at security checkpoints to the embarrassment of travelers, the scanners were subsequently modified so that a fully detailed image is displayed only at a remote analysis center. The off-site screener marks rectangles on a generic diagram corresponding to any portions of a traveler's body that look unusual. Only that marked-up diagram is displayed at the checkpoint, thereby enabling TSA officers to focus any necessary pat-down on those areas. If there is nothing suspicious on the scan, the off-site screener sends an \"OK\" message authorizing the traveler to proceed. \n The full body scanners are optional and passengers have the legal right to \"opt out\" and request a manual search instead. Furthermore, passengers may also be randomly selected for additional screening, such as an \"enhanced pat-down.\" Do not assume that you are in any sort of trouble or that you are even suspected of causing trouble, simply because you are being subjected to these further screenings. \n  Pre-clearance[edit]  Passengers whose journeys originate in major Canadian airports and involve either US or Canadian carriers will have the advantage of clearing US entry formalities (passport control and customs) at their Canadian port-of-exit. As far as most flights from Canada are concerned, they are treated similarly as US domestic flights but only because clearance has been performed at the Canadian airport. Hence once passengers from Canada arrive at their US port-of-entry, rather than walk through a secluded corridor, they can see the display of restaurants and shops at the domestic terminal on their way to baggage claim. It is worth noting that most Canadian carriers are located in US domestic terminals. \n Take note that passengers on US-Canadian flights operated by foreign air carriers will still see traditional entry formalities upon arrival at their US port-of-entry; a Canadian transit visa may be required even if passengers are confined to a holding area for the entire transit time. \n Some airports in Canada, including Vancouver International Airport, Terminal 1 of Toronto-Pearson Airport, and Montréal-Trudeau Airport generally do not require passengers in transit from abroad to pass through Canadian Customs and Immigration controls before going through US pre-clearance formalities. However, even if you pass through these airports, make sure that your papers are in order to allow you to enter Canada. If you cannot travel to the US on the same day you go through pre-clearance, if you are not cleared for entry to the United States, or if you and/or your luggage is not checked through by your airline to at least your first destination in the United States, you will need to report to Canada Customs, and in that event, a Canadian transit or temporary resident visa may be required. \n Pre-clearance facilities are available at most major Canadian airports (Toronto-Pearson, Montreal-Trudeau, Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier, Vancouver, Calgary, etc.), Queen Beatrix International Airport in Aruba, Grand Bahama and Lynden Pindling International Airports in the Bahamas, Bermuda International Airport in Bermuda, Dublin and Shannon International Airports in Ireland, and Abu Dhabi International Airport in the United Arab Emirates. \n Passengers on British Airways flights from London to New York City transiting via either Dublin or Shannon, Ireland can take advantage of US passport control and customs pre-clearance at Dublin or Shannon. Upon arrival at the US, they will arrive as domestic passengers and can transfer immediately to domestic flights. \n  By car[edit]   \n  Visa Restrictions:\nAll persons wishing to enter the United States by land must possess a valid passport; NEXUS, FAST, or passport card; Laser Visa; or an \"enhanced driver's license\" (issued by certain US states and Canadian provinces) \n  \n \n Traffic travels on the right-hand side (as it does in Canada and Mexico), except in the US Virgin Islands, due to left-hand driving being common in the smaller Caribbean islands. \n If you are entering under the Visa Waiver Program, you will need to pay a $6.00 fee, in cash, at the point of entry. No fee is payable if you are simply re-entering and already have the Visa Waiver slip in your passport. \n The US-Canada and US-Mexico borders are two of the most frequently crossed borders in the world, with millions of crossings daily. Average wait times are up to 30 minutes, but some of the most heavily traveled border crossings may have considerable delays—approaching 1-2 hours at peak times (weekends, holidays). Current wait times (updated hourly) are available on the US customs service website. The US-Mexico border is vulnerable to high levels of drug trafficking, so vehicles crossing may be X-rayed or searched by a drug-sniffing dog. If anything about you appears suspicious, you and your vehicle may be searched. Since this is an all-too-common event, expect no patience or sympathy from border agents. \n As Canada and Mexico use the metric units of measure but the US uses customary units, bear in mind that after the border, road signs are published in miles and miles per hour. Therefore, if you are driving a car from Canada or Mexico, be mindful that a speed limit of 55mph in the US is 88km/h. \n  By bus[edit]  Greyhound offers many inexpensive cross-border services from both Canada and Mexico throughout their network. Some routes, such as Toronto to Buffalo have hourly service. Megabus US also runs multiple daily trips from Toronto (also a hub for Megabus Canada) to New York City via Buffalo for as low as $1. \n Be warned that bus passengers often experience greater scrutiny from US customs officials than car or train passengers. \n Onward travel to: \n  By boat[edit]  Entering the U.S. by sea, other than on a registered cruise ship, may be difficult. The most common entry points for private boats are Los Angeles and the surrounding area, Florida, and the Eastern coastal states. \n Some passenger ferries exist between Canada and the U.S., mostly between British Columbia and Washington State (from Victoria &amp; Sidney, BC) or Alaska (from Prince Rupert). \n Cunard offers transatlantic ship travel between the United Kingdom and New York City. \n  By train[edit]  Amtrak offers international service from the Canadian cities of Vancouver (Amtrak Cascades has two trips per day to Seattle and Portland), Toronto (Maple Leaf has a daily trip to New York City), and Montreal (Adirondack has a daily trip to New York City) into the US. Note that cross border rail service is more expensive and less quick than the buses, which are more frequent and serve a larger range of US destinations from both Canada and Mexico. \n On international trains from Montreal and Toronto, immigration formalities are conducted at the border. \n Those travelling from Vancouver clear U.S. immigration and customs at the Union Pacific Station before they get on the train itself. Be sure to allow enough time before departure to complete the necessary inspections.\n Amtrak does NOT offer cross border trains to/from Mexico nor are there any other onward passenger trains going south from the U.S./Mexican border. Therefore the nearest train stations to the Mexican border are in San Diego (Pacific Surfliner) and El Paso (Sunset Limited &amp; Texas Eagle). From either train station take local transportation (light rail in San Diego or bus or taxi in El Paso) to get to the actual border crossing. \n  By foot[edit]  There are many border crossings in urban areas which can be crossed by pedestrians. Crossings such as those in or near Niagara Falls, Detroit, Tijuana, Nogales, and El Paso are popular for persons wishing to spend a day on the other side of the border. In some cases, this may be ideal for day-trippers, as crossing by car can be a much longer wait. \n  Get around[edit]   The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California\n \n\n The size of the US and the distance between some major cities make air the dominant mode of travel for short-term travelers over long distances. If you have time, travel by car, bus, or rail can be interesting. \n Be Aware: In general, outside of the downtown areas of big cities (especially New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Chicago and San Francisco), public transport in the U.S. is not as commonly used, developed, nor reliable as in many European and Asian countries. Due to cheap fuel prices, endless available parking spaces, cheap auto insurance, very cheap car prices and large distances to travel, Americans prefer to drive their own car rather than opt for public transport. \n  By plane[edit]  The quickest and often the most convenient way of long-distance intercity travel in the US is by plane. Coast-to-coast travel takes about six hours from east to west, and five hours from west to east (varying due to winds), compared to the three or four days necessary for land transportation. Most cities in the US are served by one or two airports; many small towns also have some passenger air service, although you may need to detour through a major hub airport to get there. Depending on where you are starting, it may be cheaper to drive to a nearby large city and fly or, conversely, to fly to a large city near your destination and rent a car. \n Major carriers compete for business on major routes, and travelers willing to book two or more weeks in advance can get bargains. However most smaller destinations are served by only one or two regional carriers, and prices to destinations outside of the big cities can be very expensive. \n  Service types[edit]  There are several types of airlines flying in the United States today: \n Mainline carriers also offer first class service which features a larger seat which can recline farther, free food and drinks, a fully interactive personal entertainment system, and generally better service. Round-trip fares can run over a thousand dollars, even for short flights, making the added cost not worth it for the vast majority of travelers. (Most travelers in first class get their seat as a complimentary frequent flier upgrade or similar perk.) You may also be offered an upgrade at a much lower cost during check in or at the airport if there are open seats available. Note that on certain premium transcontinental services between New York City and Los Angeles/San Francisco offered by American (\"Flagship Service\") and United (\"United p.s.\"), first class and business class services are comparable to equivalent international offerings with gourmet meals and lie-flat seats. The same is true of some flights between the East Coast and Hawaii.  They flourished in the early 1990s when the financially distressed mainline airlines began specializing in running only very large jetliners on lucrative long-distance routes. Their regional allies, specializing in operating smaller planes, would run feeder routes into the parent's hubs that would enable passengers from small towns to connect to the parent's long-distance routes; conversely, the regional airlines would enable passengers coming off the parent's long-distance routes to easily connect to outlying small towns rather than exiting at a hub airport and completing the rest of the journey by car, bus, or train.  Regional airlines tend to have a mediocre safety record. They often hire desperate pilots who are eager to break into a career in commercial aviation but for whatever reason could not qualify for or did not want to earn their flight hours in the US military. Regional pilots thus tend to work for low pay and long hours in the hope of building sufficient flight experience to apply for and get a decent-paying job as the pilot of a full-size jetliner with the regional subsidiary's parent legacy airline. As a result, there have been a number of crashes or near-misses blamed upon low-paid, overworked regional pilots.  They are operated by SkyWest; Mesa Air Group; Republic; and Express Jet as United Express, Delta Connection, American Eagle/Envoy, Alaska Airlines, Frontier, and/or US Airways Express. They operate one or several brands of the bigger 'legacy' parent(s) at the same time. Reservations and ticketing with the \"regional (commuter) carriers\" are handled through the \"legacy\" parent carriers instead of these airlines themselves.   At the other end of the spectrum, Spirit Airlines sells seats for as low as $9.00, but charges fees for everything beyond the seat: checked and hand luggage, buying a ticket online (if you want to avoid that fee, you have to buy at the counter), advance seat assignments, checking-in at the airport, printing out documents at the airport, on-board refreshments, etc. European visitors familiar with Ryanair will find Spirit's fee-for-everything business model to be strikingly similar. \n Southwest and Allegiant serve destinations nationwide, although they sometimes use smaller or alternative airports such as Chicago Midway instead of the larger O'Hare International Airport, Houston Hobby instead of the Houston Bush Intercontinental or Dallas Love Field instead of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Other low-cost carriers such as Allegiant and Sun Country focus on \"vacation destinations\" like Florida, Mexico, the Virgin Islands, etc. A relative newcomer is the trendy brainchild of Sir Richard Branson: Virgin America which offers a relatively low-priced First Class option, as well as mood lighting, relatively comfortable seats, and interactive in-flight entertainment in all classes in its aircraft. \n  Fees[edit]  The FAA has been cracking down on non-disclosed fees for a while, so the good news is that most of the prices that you immediately see when searching for flights already include all taxes and other mandatory fees applicable to all passengers. This is true whether you directly check the carrier's website or an online travel agency like Orbitz. Unlike carriers in other foreign countries, most US carriers do not explicitly impose a fuel surcharge. However, carriers charge for extra services, especially mainline/legacy ones. Here is a run down of services that may incur additional fees, as well as strategies for avoiding them if they aren't a service you need or want. Even baggage fees can be avoided with careful planning: \n Most mainline carriers feature \"cashless cabins\" meaning any on-board purchases must be paid with either Visa or MasterCard (Delta also accepts American Express). Regional subsidiaries generally do still accept cash on-board, although flight attendants may not be able break large bills - hence the traditional request \"exact change is appreciated.\" If you paid in advance for first class, checked baggage, meals, and alcoholic beverages are all included with the price of your ticket, as well as priority access to check-in agents, lounge access and boarding. \n Ironically, America's discount airlines, such as JetBlue, Southwest, and Virgin America sometimes have more amenities than the legacy carriers, and for many people may be a much better experience. Jet Blue offers over 45 channels of satellite television, non-alcoholic beverages and real snacks for free on every flight; Virgin America also has satellite TV, in addition to on demand dining (even in economy). On Jet Blue your first checked bag is free ($35 for a second bag), and Southwest is the only U.S. carrier to still offer two checked bags per passenger free of charge. Virgin America charges for checked bags, but their fees are considerably lower than the legacies. \n See Cheap airline travel in North America. \n  Security concerns[edit]  Security at US airports is known to be onerous, especially during busy holiday travel periods. Allow plenty of time and pack as lightly as possible. Ensure the amount of liquids you bring does not exceed the prescribed limit and is properly placed in the prescribed containers. Currently those limits are referred to as '311' - 3 ounces or less liquid bottles placed in one single, transparent, resealable plastic bag that is 1 quart (1 litre) or less in size. Please note that you can take as many of the little \"travel size\" 3-ounce (100 ml) bottles that you can cram into that single bag. The little bottles of shampoo and conditioner provided in the rooms at most decent hotels are perfect for this. Many pharmacies, as well as Wal-Mart, Target, and most major grocery stores have a section for \"trial or travel size\" bottles of personal care liquids that fall under the three-ounce limit. \n  By private plane[edit]  The cost of chartering the smallest private jet begins at around $4,000 per flight hour, with the cost substantially higher for larger, longer-range aircraft, and cheaper for smaller propeller planes. While private flying is by no means inexpensive, a family of four or more can often fly together at a cost similar to or even favorable to buying first class commercial airline tickets, especially to smaller airports where scheduled commercial flights are at their most expensive, and private flying is at its cheapest. Though you may find it cheaper than flying a family of four first class internationally, it is rarely the case, except when traveling from Western Europe. \n Air Charter refers to hiring a private plane for a one time journey. Jet Cards are pre-paid cards entitling the owner to a specific number of flight hours on a specified aircraft. As all expenses are pre-paid on the card, you need not to concern yourself with deadhead time, return flights, landing fees, etc. \n  By train[edit]  See also: Rail travel in the United States\n  Amtrak[edit]  Except for certain densely populated corridors (mostly near and between the big cities of the Northeast), passenger trains in the United States can be surprisingly scarce and relatively expensive. The national rail system, Amtrak (1-800-USA-RAIL), provides service to many cities, offering exceptional sightseeing opportunities, but not particularly efficient inter-city travel, and is often just as expensive as a flight. In more urban locations, Amtrak can be very efficient and comfortable, but in rural areas delays are common. Plan ahead to ensure train travel between your destinations is available and/or convenient. They have promotional discounts of 15% for students and seniors, and a 30-day U.S. Rail Pass for international travelers only. If you plan to buy a regular ticket within a week of travelling, it pays to check the website for sometimes significant \"weekly specials\". \n Amtrak offers many amenities and services that are lacking from other modes of transport. Amtrak offers many routes that traverse some of America's most beautiful areas. Travelers with limited time may not find travel by train to be convenient, simply because the country is big, and the \"bigness\" is particularly evident in many of the scenic areas. For those with ample time, though, train travel offers an unparalleled view of the U.S., without the trouble and long-term discomfort of a rental (hire) car or the hassle of flying. \n Trains running on the Washington D.C. to Boston Northeast Corridor (Acela Express and the Regional) and the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Keystone Corridor (Keystone Service and Pennsylvanian) generally run on time or very close to it. These two rail lines are electrified and owned by Amtrak or other commuter railways and are passenger only. Outside these two areas, Amtrak operates on freight lines and as a result must share track with freight trains hosted by host railroads. This means you have about as good a chance of a delay as not. While these delays are usually brief (trains make up time en route), have a contingency plan for being at least three hours late when travelling Amtrak. In fact, six hour or longer delays, especially on long-distance routes, are not uncommon, either. \n If you miss an Amtrak connection because your first train is late, Amtrak will book you onto the next available train (or in rare cases a bus) to your final destination. If your destination is on the Northeast Corridor, this isn't a big deal (departures are every hour) but in other parts of the country the next train may not be until tomorrow. If your reservations involved sleeper accommodations (Amtrak's First Class on their long-distance overnight trains) on either your late-arriving train or your missed connection, you will get a hotel voucher for the unplanned overnight stay. For coach class passengers in the same situation, you will not get a hotel voucher; your unplanned lodging arrangements and cost will be your responsibility. However, after your travel is completed, Amtrak's Customer Service will commonly offer travel vouchers of $100 or more off future Amtrak travel to inconvenienced passengers. This is true for all classes of service. \n If you plan to board an Amtrak train at a location other than the train's initial place of departure, it's usually a good idea to call ahead before you leave for the station to see if the train is running on time. \n A major Amtrak line in regular daily use by Americans is the Acela Express line, running between Boston and Washington, D.C. It stops in New York City, New Haven, Philadelphia and many other cities on the way. Acela Express is electrified, with top speeds of 150 miles per hour (though the average speed is a good deal slower because many track sections have curves too tight to be safely traversed at more than 90mph). The Acela Express features comfortable first class intercity service, but can be quite expensive. Given the difficulty and expense of getting from the center of some of the major Northeastern cities to their respective airports, trains can sometimes be more convenient than air travel. There are also frequent but much slower regional trains covering the same stations along the Northeast Corridor for lower fares. \n During usual American vacation times, some long-distance trains (outside the Northeast) can sell out weeks or even months in advance, so it pays to book early if you plan on using the long-distance trains. Booking early also results in generally lower fares for all trains since they tend to increase as trains become fuller. On the other hand, same-day reservations are usually easy, and depending on the rules of the fare you purchased, you can change travel plans on the day itself without fees. \n One major scenic long-distance train route, the California Zephyr, runs from Emeryville in the Bay Area of California to Chicago, via Reno, Salt Lake City and Denver. The full trip takes around 60 hours, but has incredible views of the Western deserts, the Rocky Mountains, and the Great Plains, things that you just cannot see if you fly. Many of the sights on this route are simply inaccessible to cars. The trains run only once per day, and they usually sell out well in advance. \n Amtrak's single most popular long-distance train is the Chicago-Seattle/Portland \"Empire Builder\" train via Milwaukee, St. Paul/Minneapolis, Fargo, Minot, Glacier National Park, Whitefish, and Spokane. In the 2007 fiscal year, this train alone carried over 503,000 passengers. \n Amtrak also provides reasonably speedy daily round trips between Seattle and Vancouver, Canada and several daily trips between Seattle and Eugene, Oregon on the Amtrak Cascades line. \n Passengers travelling long distances on Amtrak may reserve a seat in coach (Economy class) or pay extra for an upgrade to a private sleeping compartment (there are no shared rooms), which also includes all meals in the dining car. Amtrak trains in the West feature a lounge car with floor to ceiling windows, which are perfect for sightseeing. \n Bradt's USA by Rail book (ISBN 9781841623894) is a guide to all Amtrak routes, with maps, station details and other practical advice. \n  Local trains[edit]  Separate from Amtrak, many major cities offer very reliable commuter trains that carry passengers to and from the suburbs or other relatively close-by areas. Since most Americans use a car for suburban travel, some commuter train stations have park and ride facilities where you can park your car for the day to use the commuter train to get to a city's downtown core where it may be more difficult to use a car due to traffic and parking concerns. Parking rates at the commuter train stations vary due (some facilities may be operated by third parties). Some commuter train systems and services though do not operate on weekends and holidays so it's best to check the system's website to plan ahead. Please don't forget to buy tickets before you board the train as some systems will have a substantial mark-up on the tickets sold on-board while others won't sell tickets on-board and will subject you to a hefty fine instead. \n \n Some cities also have subway and light rail systems for local travel within a city. \n  By boat[edit]  America has the largest system of inland waterways of any country in the world. It is entirely possible to navigate around within the United States by boat. Your choices of watercraft range from self-propelled canoes and kayaks to elaborate houseboats and riverboat cruises. \n Rivers and canals were key to developing the country, and traversing by boat gives you a unique perspective on the nation and some one of a kind scenery. Some examples of waterways open to recreational boating and/or scheduled cruises are: \n Each year, many first time and beginning boaters successfully navigate these waterways. Do remember that any kind of boating requires some preparation and planning. In general, the Coast Guard, Canal and Seaway authorities go out of their way to help recreational boaters. They will also at times give instructions which you are expected to immediately obey. For example, small craft may be asked to give way to larger craft on canals, and weather conditions may require you to stop or change your route. \n Several coastal cities, including San Francisco, Seattle and New York City, operate ferry services between local destinations. Some islands, such as Catalina Island or Nantucket are only accessible by ferry. \n  By car[edit]  America's love affair with the automobile is legendary and most Americans use a car when moving within their city, and when travelling to nearby cities in their state or region. However, many Americans can and do travel between the vast regions of their country by auto - often going through different time zones, landscapes, and climates. In the winter months (Dec though March) millions of American nomads travel south to the warm desert and subtropical climates in everything from cars to motor homes (called \"RV's\"). \n Generally speaking, the older American cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, DC, Seattle, and Philadelphia are best to see using public transport or even on foot (at least within their downtown cores). However, the newer sunbelt cities (normally in the West and South) are built for the automobile, so renting or bringing your own car is usually a very good idea. This applies even to very large cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami, where public transport is very limited and having a car is the most practical way of getting around. In the smaller American cities, everything is very spread out and public transport thin. Taxis are often available, but if you're not at the airport, you may have to phone for one and wait a half-hour or so to be picked up, making similar arrangements to return. Taxis are typically a expensive option to use. While most Americans are happy to give driving directions, don't be surprised if many aren't familiar with the local public transport options available. \n Gas stations usually sell regional and national maps. Online maps with directions are available on several websites including MapQuest and Google Maps. Drivers can obtain directions by calling 1-800-Free411, which will provide them via text message. GPS navigation systems can be purchased for around $100, and car rental agencies often rent GPS units for a small additional fee. Many smartphones are now bundled with GPS navigation software that offers turn-by-turn directions. Your mobile phone provider may charge you for data use, since mobile phone GPS navigation is best used with an Internet connection. Several GPS navigation apps can now support \"offline maps\" features where you can download maps in advance, but without Internet access, the navigation app will not have access to real-time traffic data and may direct you to drive right into the middle of a severe traffic jam. Even states that ban the use of hand-held phones by drivers often allow the use of GPS features, as long as the driver enters no data when in motion (check local laws in the places you will be travelling). \n Unlike most of the rest of the world, the United States continues to use a system of measurement based on the old British imperial system for the most part, meaning that road signs are in miles and miles per hour, but fuel is sold in gallons smaller than those used in the UK. If driving a car from Canada or Mexico, make sure you know the conversions from metric to imperial units. In the case of Canadian cars, you should check your owner's manual to see if your speedometer and odometer can be switched from metric to imperial (and back), and if so, how to do so, and make the switch at the border stop. Most cars sold in the US and Canada today can be readily switched between the two sets of units. The vast majority of cars in the United States (and Canada, for that matter) are equipped with automatic transmission - manual (stick shift) cars are very much the exception to the rule and are generally only found on sports cars, so bear that in mind if you do rent a car. \n  Great American Road Trip[edit]  A romantic appeal is attached to the idea of long-distance car travel; many Americans will tell you that you can't see the \"real\" America except by car. Given the dearth of public transportation in most American cities, the loss of time travelling between cities by car rather than flying can be made up by the convenience of driving around within cities once you arrive. In addition, many of the country's major natural attractions, such as the Grand Canyon, are in rugged landscapes and environments, and are almost impossible to get to without an automobile. If you have the time, a classic American road trip with a rented car (see below) is very easy to achieve and quite an adventure. Just keep in mind that because of the distances, this kind of travel can mean many hours, days, or even a week behind the wheel, so pay attention to the comfort of the car you use. Some roads go though hazardous environments (hot deserts, dense forests and jungles, harsh steppes and savannas, marshy/wet areas, geothermal areas, rugged mountains,) and through areas with dangerous wildlife (Bobcats, Pumas, Jaguars, constrictors, Pronghorn, poisonous snakes, alligators, Coyotes, bears...etc) and weather (the U.S. can be struck by any manner of disasters, from tornadoes, dust storms, and hurricanes, to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis,) so be aware of the environment you are travelling through. \n  Interstate System[edit]  See also:Interstate Highway System\n  There's always a road going your way. The United States exclusively uses miles rather than kilometers!\n \n\n The United States is covered with the largest and most modern highway system in the world. Interstates are always freeways—that is, controlled access divided highways with no at-grade crossings, the equivalent of what Europeans call a \"motorway\". These roads connect all of the major population centers, and they make it easy to cover long distances—or get to the other side of a large city—quickly. These highways cross the entire US mainland from the Atlantic to the Pacific, through several time zones, landscapes, and climates. \n Most of these highways have modern and safe state run \"Rest Areas\" or \"Service Plaza\" areas. These rest stops normally offer restrooms, vending machines, and phone service. Service Plazas (more likely found on toll roads) may offer fuel, restaurant(s), and simple vehicle repair. Many of these rest stops also offer tourist information and picnic areas. Additional commercial traveler services tend to congregate on the local roads just off popular interstate highway exits. Sometimes you'll find a truck stop, an establishment that caters to long-haul truckers but is open to all travelers. Signs on the highway will indicate the services available at upcoming exits, including gas, food, lodging, and camping, so you can choose a stopping point as you're driving. \n Note that in some eastern states, Interstates are called expressways or just highways. Western states as well as US federal law defines expressways as limited access divided highways with reduced at-grade crossings (meaning that you can and will see occasional cross-traffic on western expressways), while freeways are defined as divided highways with full access control and no at-grade crossings. Many eastern states do not follow the same distinction. \n Primary Interstates have one- or two-digit numbers, with odd ones running north-south (e.g. I-5) and even ones running east-west (e.g. I-80). Three-digit interstate numbers designate shorter, secondary routes. An odd first digit signifies a \"spur\" into or away from a city; an even first digit signifies a \"loop\" around a large city. The second two digits remain the same as the primary Interstate that travels nearby (e.g., I-495 is a loop that connects to I-95). \n The vast majority of interstates do not charge tolls. However, the Departments of Transportation of Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania operate long-distance, limited-access toll roads called Turnpikes. Tolls are also frequently levied for crossing notably large bridges or tunnels, and some states are even turning to requiring tolls on Federal Interstate highways to defray their maintenance costs (West Virginia is most notable for this). While the majority of entrances and exits for the Turnpike systems of these states collect tolls in cash, states are increasingly turning to electronic tolling by outfitting vehicles with small RFID transponders, or, more recently, photographic recording and recognition of the vehicle's license plate. If you plan on driving in a state that offers toll roads, it is worthwhile to ask your rental car agency about the electronic tolling options available to you, as paying tolls in cash is becoming incrementally more difficult as electronic options and open-road tolling (paying tolls electronically without having to stop), on Florida's Turnpike in particular, are rapidly becoming more widely accepted. Nearly all rental car agencies that operate in Florida offer some form of prepaid tolling plan. Credit cards and travelers' checks are usually not accepted by state-operated toll plazas, but there are some exceptions (for example, the Ohio Turnpike accepts most major credit cards). \n Speed limits on Interstate Highways can vary from state to state, and also according to geography (for example, slower on mountain passes and within cities than on long straight rural sections). Posted speed limits can range from as low as 45 miles per hour (70km/h) in densely urban areas to as much as 85mph (135km/h) in certain rural stretches of Texas, but mostly they'll be between 65 and 70mph (105–113km/h) on the east coast and 65 to 75mph (105-120km/h) out west. The speed limits (in miles per hour) are always clearly and frequently posted on Interstates. \n American drivers often drive a bit over the posted speed limit, especially on Interstates (5 to 10mph (8–15km/h)). Driving more than 10mph over the posted speed limit greatly increases the chance of receiving a speeding ticket; 15mph or more over the limit when observed by law enforcement will usually earn you a ticket or, depending on the state, result in a license suspension. Driving too slow can actually be dangerous. A good rule of thumb is to avoid driving much faster than all other cars. Highway Patrol officers are usually most concerned with the fastest drivers, so ensuring you are slower than the fastest speeders is one way to avoid their attention. If you are pulled over, be respectful, address the officer as \"Officer,\" and express heartfelt regret at your excessive speed. You may or may not get a ticket, but remain in your car while the officer process your information. The officer will approach the car and you should roll down your window to speak. The officer will ask to see your drivers license and car registration. Such traffic stops are often routine and low key. \n Many Interstate Highways, particularly around and through very large cities, will segregate the far left-hand lane or lanes and reserve them for high-occupancy use. These lanes are clearly signed, marked with white diamonds down the center of the lane, have double-white lines on the right, and are limited to vehicles with two or more occupants. High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes, called HOV lanes or carpool lanes, are designed to ease congestion on Interstate freeways around large population centers during the very start and very end of the business day, also known colloquially as Rush Hour. At least 22 U.S. cities have HOV lanes, of which about half enforce them only during rush hour and half enforce them 24 hours. If you do not see specific hours posted for HOV lanes, assume the HOV lane restrictions are in effect at all times. \n  Off the Interstates[edit]  A secondary system of federal highways is the US Highway system. US Highways may be divided with multiple lanes in each direction on some sections, but they are often not dual carriageways, sometimes with just one lane in each direction. US Highways, which generally pre-date the Interstate system, tend to be older routes that lead through town centers as local streets (with a local name or number) at slower speeds. In many cases, Interstates were constructed roughly parallel to US Highways to expedite traffic that wishes to bypass the cities and towns. If you don't mind stopping at traffic lights and dealing with pedestrians, US Highways can lead you to some interesting off-the-beaten-path sights. \n Each state is responsible for maintenance of the Interstates and US Highways (despite the names), but each one also maintains its own system of State Highways (or State Routes) that form the bulk of the inter-community road network. State Highways are usually undivided but may occasionally be freeways; you can generally count on them being well maintained (and plowed in the winter) and that following one will get you to some form of civilization sooner rather than later. \n In most states west of the Mississippi River, the term \"freeway\" means a divided highway with full access control with maximum speed limits up to 75-80mph (120-128km/h) in Utah and western Texas, while the term \"expressway\" means a divided highway with partial access control. Expressways in western states can and do have occasional at-grade intersections with cross-traffic (that is, travelling perpendicular to mainline traffic approaching at speeds with speed limits set between 40-65mph (64-104km/h)). Only freeways in those states are guaranteed to have no cross-traffic at grade. In most states east of the Mississippi River, the term expressway always means full access control and the term freeway is either a synonym or is not used. \n  Driving laws[edit]  As with the rest of North America, Americans drive on the right in left-hand drive vehicles and pass on the left. The sole exception is the U.S. Virgin Islands, which continues to drive on the left-hand side, with mostly left-hand vehicles. White lines separate traffic moving in the same direction and yellow lines separate opposing traffic. \n Right turn on red after coming to a complete stop is legal (unless a sign prohibits it) in the majority of US states and cities. The most notable exception is New York City, where right turn on red is illegal unless a sign expressly allows it. \n Red lights and stop signs are always strictly enforced at all hours in virtually all US jurisdictions, along with traffic lights and lane lines. There is zero tolerance for many traffic manoeuvres often seen elsewhere in many countries around the world. Jumping the green, running a red, driving the wrong way on one-way streets, straddling lanes (especially in a car or truck), or swerving across the double yellow line into opposing traffic on major urban roadways to pass slower (but still moving) traffic will all result in an expensive ticket. \n Most American drivers tend to drive calmly and safely in the sprawling residential suburban neighborhoods where the majority of Americans live. However, freeways around the central areas of big cities often become crowded with a significant proportion of \"hurried\" drivers — who will exceed speed limits, make unsafe lane changes, or follow other cars at unsafe close distances (known as \"tailgating\"). Enforcement of posted speed limits is somewhat unpredictable and varies widely from state to state. Not exceeding the pace of other drivers will usually avoid a troublesome citation. Beware of small towns along otherwise high-speed rural roads (and medium-speed suburban roads); the reduced speed limits often posted for traffic going through such towns are strictly enforced. \n Another issue in many locations is drivers who linger in left lanes of multi-lane divided highways — that is, who refuse to move to the right for traffic attempting to pass. While this is seen as extremely discourteous and often dangerous, it is not illegal in most US jurisdictions unless the driver is travelling well below the speed limit. (This differs, for example, from Germany, where failing to move right to make way for passing drivers and passing on the right are very serious violations and strictly enforced.) One state that has attempted to address this issue is Georgia, which passed a law in March 2014 making it a violation to fail to move to the right for a passing vehicle, even if the driver being passed is exceeding the posted speed limit. \n Driving law is primarily a matter of state law and is enforced by state and local police. Fortunately, widespread adoption of provisions of the Uniform Vehicle Code, and federal regulation of traffic signs under the Highway Safety Act, means that most driving laws do not vary much from one state to the next. All states publish an official driver's handbook which summarizes state driving laws in plain English. These handbooks are usually available both on the Web and at many government offices. \n AAA publishes a AAA/CAA Digest of Motor Laws, which is now available online for free. The Digest contains comprehensive summaries in plain English of all major driving laws that typically vary between states. The Digest's coverage includes all US states and all Canadian provinces. \n International visitors aged 18 and older can usually drive on their foreign driver's license for up to a year, depending on state law. Licenses that are not in English must be accompanied by an International Driving Permit (IDP) or a certified translation. Persons who will be in the United States for more than a year must obtain a driver's license from the state they are residing in. Written and practical driving tests are required, but they are usually waived for holders of valid Canadian, Mexican, and some European licenses. \n Traffic signs often depend on the ability to read English words. Drivers who can read English will find most signs self-explanatory. (Progress toward adopting signs with internationally understood symbols is extremely slow; don't count on seeing any.) Distances and speeds will almost always be given in miles and miles per hour (mph), without these units specified. Some areas near the Canadian and Mexican borders may feature road signs with distances in both miles and kilometers. \n Police patrol cars vary in make, model, color, and livery from state to state and even town to town, but all are equipped with red and/or blue flashing lights and a siren. Many police vehicles in the United States are American brand (Ford, Chevrolet, etc). If you see the lights or hear the siren, pull to the right-hand shoulder of the road to let them by. If the patrol car is directly behind you, it's your car the officer is targeting; in that case, pull over as soon as it is practical for you to do so safely, even if this means driving some extra distance. It is extremely important that you pull off the road as soon as you are able. Use your turn signals or your hazard lights to show the officer you are complying. The officer will request to see your drivers license, the registration for the vehicle, and your proof of insurance coverage, and/or rental car documentation. Many traffic stops are recorded by a video camera in the officer's patrol car, as well as a lapel microphone on their person. See the section on police officers in the Stay Safe section below. \n There's a chance of coming across a police interior border checkpoint when driving on the highway. The permanent ones are in the states bordering Mexico. But there's a random chance of encountering temporary ones in any state. The purpose is to help prevent illegal immigration. As with crossing into the U.S. from neighboring countries, police will require you to show proof of identification and will check your vehicle for any possible illegal immigrant(s) or other illegals federal or state wise. \n  Car rental[edit]  Generally, you must be 25 or older to rent a car without restrictions or special charges. Rental car agencies in some states may be able to rent a vehicle to drivers as young as 21, but may impose a hefty surcharge. The states of New York and Michigan have laws forcing rental car agencies to rent to drivers as young as 18. \n Virtually every car from every rental agency in the U.S. runs on unleaded gasoline and has an automatic transmission. Renting a car usually costs anywhere from $20 and $100 per day for a basic sedan, depending on the type of car and location, with some discounts for week-long rentals. \n European car rental giant Sixt ☎ +1 888 749-8227 has been expanding into the US in recent years, and is found in a handful of states, but is absent from important states like Hawaii and Illinois. For several years, European car rental company Europcar was allied with National, but in 2013 switched its US alliance partner to Advantage Rent A Car. \n There are no large national discount car rental agencies, but in each city there is usually at least one. Some discount car rental companies which operate only in particular regions are Advantage Rent A Car [6] (now owned by Hertz and expanding across the country), E-Z Rent-A-Car [7] (+1 800 277 5171) and Fox Rent A Car [8]. The Internet or the Yellow Pages are the easiest ways to find them. Another well-known discount chain is Rent-A-Wreck [9] (+1 800 944 7501). It rents used cars at significantly lower prices. \n Most rental car agencies have downtown offices in major cities as well as offices at major airports. Not all companies allow picking up a car in one city and dropping it off in another (the ones that do almost always charge extra for the privilege); check with the rental agency when making your reservations. \n One factor that will strongly influence the price of your car rental will be location. Sometimes renting a car at an airport or near-airport location will cost three or four times as much as renting the same car from the same company at a location far from the airport (but your cost calculations must incorporate the additional time and money it will take to reach the distant off-airport location). In other areas, the airport location may be cheaper. Online travel websites such as Orbitz or Expedia can be useful for comparing prices and making reservations. \n Rental agencies accept a valid driver's license from your country, which must be presented with an International Drivers Permit if your license needs to be translated. You may wish to join some kind of auto club before starting a large American road trip, and having a cell phone is a very good idea. Most rental agencies have some kind of emergency road service program, but they can have spotty coverage for remote regions. The largest club in the United States is the American Automobile Association [10] (+1-800-391-4AAA), known as \"Triple A\". A yearly membership runs about $60. AAA members also get discounts at many hotels, motels, restaurants and attractions; which may make it worth getting a membership even if you don't drive. Note that some non-U.S. automobile clubs have affiliate relationships with AAA, allowing members of the non-U.S. club to take full advantage of AAA road service and discount programs. Among these clubs are the Canadian Automobile Association, The Automobile Association in the UK, and ADAC in Germany. \n Alternatively, Better World Club [11] (+1-866-238-1137) offers similar rates and benefits as AAA, but with often more timely service. It is a more eco-friendly choice as 1% of revenue is donated to environmental cleanup programs. . \n The prices shown on rental car Web sites vary dramatically based upon whether the renter is a US resident or not. There are several reasons for this. \n On the one hand, US residents are charged less because the rental car companies know that most Americans are covered for loss or damage to the rental car either by their credit card or the insurance policy on their primary personal vehicle at home, and most American personal auto policies extend coverage to rental cars. Without appropriate loss damage waiver cover, you could be personally liable for the entire cost of the car should it be written off in an accident, and without appropriate liability insurance, you could face serious criminal or civil liability if you are later held to be at fault by a court of law for an accident which caused serious personal injury or death. Purchasing loss damage waiver cover, and both required and supplemental liability insurance may add up to $30/day to the price of a rental, in some cases doubling the price of the rental. \n On the other hand, the rental car industry is well aware that many visitors are from countries which aren't as wealthy as the US, and that some countries also have strict driver licensing and testing schemes that sharply reduce the likelihood of licensed drivers getting into accidents abroad. Thus, they try to optimize pricing separately for such visitors. If you identify your country of origin or book through Web sites customized to your own local market, you may be given a quote which includes loss damage waiver and both required and supplemental liability insurance for considerably less. Many travel insurance policies include cover for some rental car damage - check your policy against the rental terms and conditions. \n  Fuel[edit]  Gasoline (\"gas\") is sold by the gallon, at stations that are primarily self-service (you must pump your own gas) with the exception of those in New Jersey and parts of Oregon (where self-service is illegal). The American gallon is smaller than the UK gallon, and equals 3.785 liters. The US octane scale is different from that used in Europe; a regular gallon of U.S. gasoline is rated at 87 octane, the equivalent of about 92 in Europe. In most states, gas stations offer a choice of three levels of octane: 87 (regular), 89 (midgrade or plus), and 91 (premium). Unless you are renting a luxury vehicle, your vehicle will likely require only 87 regular. \n One octane-related detail to watch for—at higher elevations in the mountain west, regular unleaded is often rated at 85 or 86 octane. This practice began when car engines had carburetors, and lower octane helped those cars run smoothly at altitude. Using 85 or 86 octane in a modern, fuel-injected vehicle rated for 87 octane or higher for prolonged periods may cause engine damage. \n Visitors from countries where self-service is illegal may feel intimidated by the idea of pumping their own gas, but should not be. US self-service gas pumps have clear directions printed on them and are easy to use. The pump will automatically stop when it senses gas backing up into the nozzle (thus indicating the tank is full). When you finish, replace the nozzle in its slot on the pump, reinsert and turn the gas cap until it begins to make clicking noises, and then close the gas cap access door. \n Nevertheless, most self-service gas stations will have staff on-hand to pump gas for you if you need assistance. Simply honk your horn quickly a couple of times, or ask for assistance inside the office or adjoining convenience store. \n Diesel is not as common, due to heavier federal taxes on it. But it is still widely used and available at most stations, especially those catering to truckers. Untaxed \"offroad diesel\", sold in rural areas for agricultural use, is dyed red and should not be used in cars, as there are heavy fines if you're caught. \n Despite increasing petroleum prices worldwide and some increases in gas taxes, the American consumer-voter's attachment to his automobile, combined with abundant domestic oil reserves and relatively low taxes on gasoline, has kept retail fuel prices much lower than in many parts of the world. Prices fluctuate by region and season. As of December 2014, current prices are averaging near $2.27/gallon (equivalent to $0.59/L) for regular and $3.16/gallon for diesel ($0.83/L). Fuel prices in the United States tend to change every season. \n Gas prices vary dramatically from state, territory, and federal district based on a number of variables, primarily state sales tax rates (which are invariably included in the advertised price) and anti-pollution requirements. The highest prices are usually found in Hawaii, Alaska, the West Coast, Illinois, and New York. The lowest prices are generally found in the south central US and also South Carolina. Prices can also vary by city, town, village, and rural area. \n The only truly nationwide gas station chains are Shell and Mobil. Other large chains have achieved almost nationwide coverage but are notably absent from at least one region, like Chevron, Texaco, Exxon, Valero, and Conoco. \n Many gas stations have adjoining \"mini-marts\" or convenience stores where snacks, soda, coffee, and cigarettes are sold, and may or may not offer public bathroom access. In some states, you can also purchase beer. Larger chain stations may also be attached to an \"express\" version of a fast food chain (McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, Subway, etc). \n  By bus[edit]   Long distance[edit]  Intercity bus travel in the United States is widespread and, while not available everywhere, there are at least three daily routes in every state. Service between nearby major cities is extremely frequent (e.g. as of July 2012 there are 82 daily buses, by seven operators, on an off-peak weekday each way between Boston and New York, an average of nearly one every 10 minutes during daytime hours). Many patrons use bus travel when other modes aren't readily available, as buses often connect many smaller towns with regional cities. The disadvantaged and elderly may use these bus lines, as automobile travel proves arduous or not affordable for some. It's commonly considered a \"lower class\" way to travel, but is generally dependable, safe, affordable. \n Greyhound Bus Lines (First Group) ☎ +1 800-229-9424 and several subsidiaries and affiliated partners (Neon (Toronto &amp; New York); Cruceros USA (US states of Arizona &amp; California and Mexican states of Baja Califronia Norte &amp; Sonora); Valley Transit (Rio Grande valley in southern Texas); Autobuses Americanos (US states of Colorado, New Mexico &amp; Texas and the Mexican states of Coahuila, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas), and Greyhound Canada) have the predominant share of American bus travel. Steep discounts are available to travelers who purchase their tickets 7-14 days in advance of their travel date. Their North American Discovery Pass allows unlimited travel for ranges of 4 to 60 days, but you might want to try riding one or two buses first before locking yourself in to an exclusively-bus American journey. Greyhound buses typically runs in 5-7 hour segments, at which time all passengers must get off the bus so it can be serviced, even if it's the middle of the night. Continuing passengers are boarded before those just getting on. There are no reservations on Greyhound buses. All seating is on a first come, first served basis, with the exception of select cities, where you can pay a $5 fee for priority seating. Greyhound buses are being refurbished with more comfortable seating, wireless Internet, and other improvements. \n Stagecoach Group owns &amp; operates Coach USA and Megabus. They offer inexpensive daily bus service departing from curbside bus stops in various parts of the country: the entire East Coast from Maine to Florida and as far west as California and Nebraska (and to Canada) from several hub cities. \n Trailways is another provider of intercity bus service. They are not a single company, but a group of individual companies franchised to form a network. Trailways used to have many more routes until most of them were bought by Greyhound in 1987. Today it is still possible to travel to many places by Trailways, but some companies are isolated from the system and you must connect through Greyhound while other Trailways companies operate mainly as a chartered bus and do not offer scheduled services. They do serve many places that Greyhound doesn't and ally with Greyhound against other competitors. \n So called Chinatown buses also provide curb-side departures for a standard walk-up cash fare often much lower than other operators' fares. These lines operate through the East Coast down with some further out destinations in the Midwest, the South, and along as along the West Coast. GoToBus.com is the largest online booking agent for these smaller \"Chinatown\" bus companies. Please note that most Internet-based and Chinatown buses only go to large cities, skipping the smaller towns that many bus travelers ride to. A number of these smaller \"Chinatown\" companies had also been shut down by the government due to safety violations. \n Hispanic bus companies tend to have the most spacious buses in the country. Connections within Texas or from Texas to the Midwest (all the way to Chicago), the Southeast, and/or Mexico are offered by: \n Service in and out of Florida to the southeast and with some continuing up along the eastern seaboard to New York &amp; Pennsylvania (I-95 corridor). They are offered by: \n In Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico and/or western Texas and the northwestern Mexican states of Baja California Norte, Chihuahua, Durando and Sonora include: \n Onward travel further south of the border can also be booked with Grupo Estrella Blanca through Greyhound as well. \n There are numerous other independent operators, many of which are also affiliated with Greyhound or Amtrak through partnership agreements while others are unaffiliated. The below are some of the other independent carriers: \n The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulates and certifies all interstate bus operators. FMCSA is notorious for being overworked and underfunded, which means they have a hard time properly regulating the numerous bus operators around the country. The newer curbside bus operators (as in the Chinatown and Internet-based buses) are more dangerous than traditional terminal-based operators like Greyhound, though buses in general are still far safer than driving a private vehicle. \n  Local travel[edit]  Otherwise see the entries for individual U.S. states and/or cities for additional independent companies and transit agencies (operated by local government (local council)) \n  By recreational vehicle (RV)[edit]  Main article: Car Camping\n Recreational vehicles – large, sometimes bus sized vehicles that include sleeping and living quarters – are a distinctly American way to cruise the country. Some RVers love the convenience of being able to drive their home anywhere they like and enjoy the camaraderie that RV campgrounds offer. Other people dislike the hassles and maintenance issues that come with RVing. And don't even think about driving an RV into a huge metropolis such as New York. Still, if you want to drive extensively within the United States and are comfortable handling a big rig, renting an RV is an option you should consider. \n  By motorcycle[edit]  The thrill and exhilaration of cross country travel are magnified when you go by motorcycle. Harley-Davidson is the preeminent American motorcycle brand and Harley operates a motorcycle rental program for those licensed and capable of handling a full weight motorcycle. In some parts of the country, you can also rent other types of motorcycles, such as sportbikes, touring bikes, and dual-sport bikes. For those inexperienced with motorcycles, Harley and other dealerships offer classes for beginners. Wearing a helmet, although not required in all states, is always a good idea. The practice of riding between lanes of slower cars, also known as \"lane-sharing\" or \"lane-splitting,\" is illegal, except in California where it is tolerated and widespread. Solo motorcyclists can legally use \"high-occupancy vehicle\" or \"carpool\" lanes during their hours of operation. \n American enthusiasm towards motorcycles has led to a motorcycling subculture. Motorcycle clubs are exclusive clubs for members dedicated to riding a particular brand of motorcycle within a highly structured club hierarchy. Riding clubs may or may not be organized around a specific brand of bikes and offer open membership to anyone interested in riding. Motorcycle rallies, such as the famous one in Sturgis, South Dakota, are huge gatherings of motorcyclists from around the country. Many motorcyclists are not affiliated with any club and opt to ride independently or with friends. In general, motorcycling is seen as a hobby, as opposed to a practical means of transportation; this means, for example, that most American motorcyclists prefer not to ride in inclement weather. However you choose to ride, and whatever brand of bike you prefer, motorcycling can be a thrilling way to see the country. \n  By thumb[edit]   Gateway Arch, St. Louis, Missouri in the Midwest \n \n\n A long history of hitchhiking comes out of the U.S., with record of automobile hitchhikers as early as 1911. Today, hitchhiking is nowhere near as common, but there are some nevertheless who still attempt short or cross-country trips. The laws related to hitchhiking in the U.S. are most covered by the Uniform Vehicle Code (UVC), adopted with changes in wording by individual states. In general, it is legal to hitchhike throughout the majority of the country, if not standing within the boundaries of a highway (usually marked by a solid white line at the shoulder of the road) and if not on an Interstate highway prohibiting pedestrians. \n In many states Interstate highways do not allow foot traffic, so hitchhikers must use the entrance ramps. In a few states it is allowed or tolerated (unless on a toll road). Oklahoma, Texas and Oregon are a few states that do allow pedestrians on the highway shoulder, although not in some metropolitan areas. Oklahoma allows foot traffic on all free interstates, but not toll roads and Texas only bans it on toll roads — and on free Interstates within the city of El Paso. Oregon only bans it in the Portland metro area. Missouri only bans it within Kansas City and St. Louis city limits. \n Hitchhiking has become much less popular due to increasing wariness of the possible dangers (fueled in part by sensational stories in the news media). International travelers to the U.S. should avoid this practice unless they have either a particularly strong sense of social adventure or extremely little money. Even many Americans themselves would only feel comfortable \"thumbing a ride\" if they had a good knowledge of the locale. \n  5-1-1[edit]  Some states offer traffic and public transport information by dialing 511 on your phone. \n  Talk[edit]   \"Two countries divided by a common language\"\n\n Users of British and Commonwealth English will find quite a few terms which differ in US English: \n Please see our English language varieties article for more words that differ. \n  \n Most Americans speak English. In many areas, (parts of the South, New England, inner cities, and in the upper Midwest), you'll find some distinctive regional accents and dialects. Nowhere should this pose any problem to a visitor, as Americans often admire foreign accents and most will approximate the standard accent to help you understand them, or try to speak your language if they can. Only 18.5% of American students study a foreign language in primary or secondary school. \n Thus, visitors are generally expected to speak and understand English. The US does not have an official language at the federal (national) level (most states have English as their official language). A growing number of popular tourist sites have signs in other languages, but only English is certain to be available at any given location. There is a wide variety of accents across the U.S., where certain words are spoken or pronounced differently. \n Due primarily to immigration from Latin America, the United States has the third-largest Spanish speaking population in the world. Spanish is a second language in some of the United States, especially California, the Southwest, Texas, Florida, and, to a lesser extent, in the metropolitan areas of the Midwest and East Coast. Many of these areas have Spanish-language radio and television stations, with local, national and Mexican programs. \n Spanish is the first language of Puerto Rico and about 13% of residents on the mainland, most of whom live in the West or South. Spanish speakers in the United States are primarily Puerto Ricans, or first- and second-generation immigrants from Latin America. As a result, the Spanish spoken is almost invariably a Latin American or Puerto Rican dialect. In some areas, a good handle on Spanish can make communication easier. Because many immigrants take service-industry jobs for substandard pay, employees at restaurants, hotels, gas stations, and other such establishments in the West and South are more likely to understand, speak, and translate Spanish. About 13% of primary and secondary students in the United States study Spanish, and may be able to understand basic phrases. \n \n\n  Map of Spanish speaking population of USA by county.\n \n\n \nFrench is the primary second language in rural areas near the border with Quebec, in some areas of Louisiana, and among West African immigrants, but is not widespread elsewhere. In southern Florida, Haitian immigrants primarily speak Haitian Creole, a separate language derived from French, as their second language, although a substantial number also speak French. \n Thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), some products now have trilingual packaging in English, Spanish, and French for sale throughout the entire trade bloc, especially household cleaning products and small electric appliances. In areas with large numbers of Spanish speakers, the major discount stores like Walmart and Target have internal directional signage in their stores in both Spanish and English. However, the vast majority of consumer products are labeled only in English, and most upscale department stores and boutiques have signage only in English, meaning that a rudimentary grasp of English is essential for shopping. \n Hawaiian is the native language of Hawaii but is rarely spoken. Japanese is widely spoken. In the various Chinatowns in major cities, Cantonese and Mandarin are common. Smaller immigrant groups also sometimes form their own pockets of shared language, including Russian, Italian, Greek, Arabic, Tagalog, Korean, Vietnamese, and others. Chicago, for instance, is the city with the second largest ethnic Polish population in the world, behind Warsaw. The Amish, who have lived in Pennsylvania and Ohio for generations, speak a dialect of German. \n Some Native Americans speak their respective native languages, especially on reservations in the West. However, despite efforts to revive them, many Native American languages are endangered, and people who speak them as their first language are few and far between. Navajo speakers in Arizona and New Mexico are an exception to this, but even a clear majority among them speak and understand English too. \n Bottom line: unless you're certain you'll be traveling in an area populated with recent immigrants, don't expect to get by in the United States without some English.\n American Sign Language, or ASL is the dominant sign language in the United States. When events are interpreted, they will be interpreted in ASL. Users of French Sign Language and other related languages may find ASL intelligible, as they share much vocabulary, but users of British Sign Language or Auslan will not. Closed-captioning on television is widespread, but far from ubiquitous. Many theaters offer FM loops or other assistive listening devices, but captioning and interpreters are rarer. \n For the blind, many signs and displays include Braille transcriptions of the printed English. Larger restaurant chains, museums, and parks may offer Braille menus and guidebooks, but you'll likely have to ask for them. \n  See[edit][add listing]   Portland Head Lighthouse, Cape Elizabeth, Maine, in New England \n \n\n The United States is extraordinarily diverse in its array of attractions. You will never run out of things to see; even if you think you've exhausted what one place has to offer, the next destination is only a road trip away. \n The Great American Road Trip (see above) is the most traditional way to see a variety of sights; just hop in the car and cruise down the Interstates, stopping at the convenient roadside hotels and restaurants as necessary, and stopping at every interesting tourist trap along the way, until you reach your destination. \n Heartbreakingly beautiful scenery, history that reads like a screenplay, entertainment options that can last you for days, and some of the world's greatest architecture—no matter what your pleasure, you can find it almost anywhere you look in the United States. \n Because the country is so big, it is impossible to truly see it all in one trip. Even the longest available coast-to-coast escorted tour packages (approximately 20 to 45 days in length) only cover about half of the Lower 48 states and do not include Alaska, Hawaii, or the inhabited territories (i.e., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam), all of which are also fine tourist destinations in their own right. Thus, as with any large country, you need to do extensive research and prioritize regions and destinations. \n  Natural scenery[edit]   Diamond Head &amp; Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Hawaii \n \n\n From the spectacular glaciers of Alaska to the steamy and lush, weathered peaks of Appalachia; from the otherworldly desertscapes of the Southwest to the vast waters of the Great Lakes and the perpetually warm jungles of the south; few other countries have as wide a variety of natural scenery as the United States does. Note though, that place names that include the word \"falls\" don't always have a waterfall. Sometimes, \"falls\" refers to \"rapids\" instead. \n America's National Parks are a great place to start. Yellowstone National Park was the first true National Park in the world, and it remains one of the most famous, but there are 57 others. The Grand Canyon is possibly the world's most spectacular gorge; Sequoia National Park and Yosemite National Park are both home to the world's largest living organisms, the Giant Sequoia; Redwood National park has the tallest, the Coast Redwood; Glacier National Park is home to majestic glacier-carved mountains; Canyonlands National Park could easily be mistaken for Mars; and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park features abundant wildlife among beautiful, verdant waterfalls and mountains. And the national parks aren't just for sightseeing, either; each has plenty of outdoors activities as well. \n Still, the National Parks are just the beginning. The National Park Service also operates National Monuments, National Memorials, National Historic Sites, National Seashores, National Heritage Areas... the list goes on (and on). And each state has its own state parks that can be just as good as the federal versions. Most all of these destinations, federal or state, have an admission fee, but it all goes toward maintenance and operations of the parks, and the rewards are well worth it. \n Those aren't your only options, though. Many of America's natural treasures can be seen without passing through admission gates. The world-famous Niagara Falls straddle the border between Canada and the U.S.; the American side lets you get right up next to the onrush and feel the power that has shaped the Niagara gorge. The \"purple majesty\" of the Rocky Mountains can be seen for hundreds of miles in any direction, while the placid coastal areas of the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic have relaxed Americans for generations. The lush, humid forests of the east, the white sand beaches, the limestone mountains of the south, the red extraterrestrial landscapes of the west...it's a country that has something for everyone. \n  Historical attractions[edit]  Americans often have a misconception of their country as having little history. The US does indeed have a tremendous wealth of historical attractions—more than enough to fill months of history-centric touring. \n The prehistory of the continent can be a little hard to uncover, as many pre-contact sites in the Eastern and Midwestern parts of the country have been covered by other structures or farmland. But particularly in the West, you will find magnificent cliff dwellings at sites such as Mesa Verde, as well as near-ubiquitous rock paintings. In the Midwest, the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site is worth a visit. The Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. is another great place to start learning about America's culture before the arrival of European colonists. \n As the first part of the country to be colonized by Europeans, the eastern states of New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the South have more than their fair share of sites from early American history. The first successful British colony on the continent was at Jamestown, Virginia, although the settlement at Plymouth, Massachusetts, may loom larger in the nation's mind. \n In the eighteenth century, major centers of commerce developed in Philadelphia and Boston, and as the colonies grew in size, wealth, and self-confidence, relations with Great Britain became strained, culminating in the Boston Tea Party and the ensuing Revolutionary War... \n  Monuments and architecture[edit]  Americans have never shied away from heroic feats of engineering, and many of them are among the country's biggest tourist attractions. \n Washington, D.C., as the nation's capital, has more monuments and statuary than you could see in a day, but do be sure to visit the Washington Monument (the world's tallest obelisk), the stately Lincoln Memorial, and the incredibly moving Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The city's architecture is also an attraction—the Capitol Building and the White House are two of the most iconic buildings in the country and often serve to represent the whole nation to the world. \n Actually, a number of American cities have world-renowned skylines, perhaps none more so than the concrete canyons of Manhattan, part of New York City. The site of the destroyed World Trade Center towers remains a gaping wound in Manhattan's vista, however America's tallest building, the new 1 World Trade Center, now stands adjacent to the site of the former towers. Also, the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building stand tall, as they have for almost a century. Chicago, where the skyscraper was invented, is home to the country's single tallest building, the (former) Sears Tower, and an awful lot of other really tall buildings. Other skylines worth seeing include San Francisco (with the Golden Gate Bridge), Seattle (including the Space Needle), Miami, and Pittsburgh. \n Some human constructions transcend skyline, though, and become iconic symbols in their own right. The Gateway Arch in St. Louis, the Statue of Liberty in Manhattan, the Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, and even the fountains of the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas all draw visitors to their respective cities. Even the incredible Mount Rushmore, located far from any major city, still attracts two million visitors each year. \n  Museums and galleries[edit]  In the US, there's a museum for practically everything. From toys to priceless artifacts, from entertainment legends to dinosaur bones—nearly every city in the country has a museum worth visiting. \n The highest concentrations of these museums are found in the largest cities, of course, but none compare to Washington, D.C., home to the Smithsonian Institution. With almost twenty independent museums, most of them located on the National Mall, the Smithsonian is the foremost curator of American history and achievement. The most popular of the Smithsonian museums are the National Air and Space Museum, the National Museum of American History, and the National Museum of Natural History, but any of the Smithsonian museums would be a great way to spend an afternoon—and they're all 100% free. \n New York City also has an outstanding array of world-class museums, including the Guggenheim Museum, the American Museum of Natural History,the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, and the Ellis Island Immigration Museum. \n You could spend weeks exploring the cultural institutions just in D.C. and the Big Apple, but here's a small fraction of the other great museums you'd be missing: \n  Itineraries[edit]  Here is a handful of itineraries spanning regions across the United States: \n  Do[edit][add listing]   Baseball in Daytona Beach, Florida \n \n\n  Buy[edit][add listing]   Money[edit]  Official currency is the United States dollar ($), divided into 100 cents (¢). Conversion rates vary daily and are available online. The dollar is colloquially known as the buck (a reference to when buck skins were used as a median of exchange in areas far from the coastal mints) so 5 bucks means $5. Foreign currencies are almost never accepted, although some major hotel chains may accept travelers' checks in other currencies. Canadian currency is sometimes accepted at larger stores within 100 miles of the border, but discounted for the exchange rate. (This is more of an issue nowadays with a weak Canadian dollar.) Watch for stores that really want Canadian shoppers and will accept at par. Often, a few Canadian coins (especially pennies) won't be noticed, and do show up in circulation with American coins as they are the same size (but different metal contents and weight). Now that the Mexican peso has stabilized, it is somewhat accepted in a limited number of locations at border towns (El Paso, San Diego, Laredo, etc), but you're better off exchanging your pesos in Mexico, and using US dollars instead, to ensure the best exchange rate. \n Common American bills are for $1, $5, $10, $20, while the $50 and $100 bills are less common, and the $2 bill is usually only available by special request at a bank. All bills are the same size. All bills are made of a paper blend of cotton and linen; no polymer bills have been released. All $1, $2, and the older $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills are greenish on one side and printed with black and green ink in the other. Newer versions of the $5 (purple), $10 (orange), $20 (green &amp; orange), $50 (pink) and $100 (blue) bills incorporate different gradations of color in the paper and additional colors of ink. As designs are updated every 5-10 years to make it more difficult to counterfeit, you will currently find up to three different designs of some bills in circulation. Almost all vending machines accept $1 bills and a few accept $5 bills; acceptance of larger bills ($50 and $100) by small restaurants and stores is less common because they may not have enough change available. No US banknotes have been demonetized in the last 80 years and older series of bills are valid. In the unlucky event that your dollars get damaged or torn, U.S. banks will replace the notes for free if enough of the security features are still legible. Note that $2 bills are uncommon and often considered a novelty or a collector's item, or sometimes even a fun gift. \n The standard coins are the penny (1¢, copper color), the chunky nickel (5¢, silver color), the tiny dime (10¢, silver color) and the quarter or quarter dollar (25¢, silver color). None of these coins display the numeral of their value, so it is important to recognize the names of each. The size doesn't necessarily correspond to their relative value: the dime is the smallest coin, followed by the penny, nickel, and quarter. However, the four standard coins have had stable designs, at least on their obverses. The same American presidents have graced the front of the penny, nickel, dime, and quarter since 1909, 1938, 1946, and 1932 respectively. They also have had the same respective diameters and thicknesses since before the 20th century, so it is possible and common to receive coins decades old in change. The Half dollar (50¢, silver) and dollar ($1, silver or gold colored) coins exist but are uncommon in general circulation. No American coins have been devalued or demonetized, although changes in design and composition have driven virtually all examples of non-current types from circulation and coin tills. \n Coin-operated machines universally accept nickels, dimes, and quarters. Pennies will not be accepted at unmanned vending machines or parking meters, but will be accepted at self-scan checkout machines at supermarkets. Most machines that accept coins will accept dollar coins, although this may not be stated on the machine since the dollar coin is not often used. Machines that accept coins will not accept half dollars, unless specifically marked that they will. Coin-operated machines may or may not accept similarly sized and valued foreign coins (i.e., Canadian coins) depending on the sensitivity and internal settings of the machine. \n  Currency exchange and banking[edit]  Currency exchange centers are rare outside the downtowns of major coastal and border cities, and international airports, however, many banks can also provide currency exchange services. Note that exchange rates are mediocre at airports and downright terrible at currency exchange centers in the suburbs. It is easiest to exchange major currencies like the euro, the UK pound, the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso, and the Canadian dollar. Visitors in possession of other currencies will find less places willing to accept them, or if at all, at less optimal rates. Major foreign exchange services at airports are provided by either Travelex or ICE Plc (International Currency Exchange)\n The Big Four U.S. retail banks are Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citibank, all of which have branches and ATMs in most major cities in the Lower 48 states. Because interstate bank branching was legalized only in 1994, many parts of the U.S. (like Hawaii, Alaska, and the territories) are poorly served by the big retail banks and are dominated by local banks. A few international banks have made inroads into the U.S. like HSBC, BBVA, and Rabobank, but because the country is so big, they are still relative newcomers and interstate banking laws are so restrictive, their branch networks are relatively limited. \n Most automated teller machines (ATMs) can handle foreign bank cards or credit cards bearing Visa/Plus or MasterCard/Cirrus logos; note, however, that many ATMs charge fees of about $3 for use with cards issued by other banks (often waived for cards issued outside of the U.S., but banks in one's home country may charge their own fees). Smaller ATMs found in restaurants etc. often charge higher fees (up to $5). Some ATMs (such as those at Sheetz gas stations and government buildings such as courthouses) have no fee. Another option is withdrawing cash (usually up to $40 over the cost of your goods) when making a debit-card purchase at a large discount store such as Walmart or Target, or at many supermarkets. Stores almost never charge a fee for this service, though the bank that issued your card may. \n Unless your debit / credit card is U.S issued, expect to incur foreign transaction fees from your bank. \n Most bank ATMs support at least one language (usually Spanish) in addition to English. ATMs operated by the Big Four banks tend to support many more languages, especially in urban areas. \n If you are from a country or territory with the US dollar as a official currency, you will not need to worry about understanding prices and currency transferring. Also if you are from Bermuda, Panama, or Bahamas, the official currency(ies) of the mentioned countries and territories have fixed exchange rates to the US Dollar. Meaning what price is said in the U.S. will be understood with your country's/territory's official currency. Example; $125 US Dollars will equal $125 Bermudian dollars, but you will still have to exchange currencies. \n  Credit and debit cards[edit]  Major credit cards Visa and MasterCard were both launched in the U.S., so it makes sense that today, Visa and MasterCard (and their debit card counterparts/affiliates) are widely used and accepted throughout all 50 states and all inhabited territories. Nearly all large retailers will accept credit cards for transactions of all sizes, even as small as one or two dollars. However, some small businesses and independently-owned stores specify a minimum amount of money (usually $2-5, but can legally charge up to $10 minimum) for credit card use, as such transactions cost them around 30 to 50 cents (this practice is also common at bars when opening a tab). Almost all sit-down restaurants, hotels, and shops will accept credit and debit cards; those that do not post a sign saying \"CASH ONLY.\" Other cards such as American Express and Discover are also accepted by most retailers, but not as widely. Many retailers have a window sticker or counter sign showing the logos of the four big U.S. credit cards: Visa, MasterCard, AmEx, and Discover. However, major retailers might accept only cash or debit cards for payment of prepaid/gift cards/transportation passes. It is also possible to find vending machines which accept credit cards. \n Historically, logos for foreign cards like JCB and China UnionPay were very hard to find outside of high-end luxury boutiques, although both JCB and China UnionPay have longstanding alliances with Discover and can be used anywhere that takes Discover cards. In 2012, many U.S. stores, including Walmart, added JCB and China UnionPay logos to attract Asian tourists. \n When making large purchases, it is typical for U.S. retailers to ask to see some form of photo identification. Shops may also ask for photo identification for foreign issued cards. In certain circumstances, credit/debit cards are the only means to perform a transaction. Hence if you do not have one, you can purchase a prepaid card or gift card with Visa/Mastercard or Amex logo for yourself in a good number of stores but you may need to provide identification before the card is activated. \n Transaction authorization is made by signing a paper sales slip or a computer pad, although many retailers will waive the signature requirement for small purchases. The US has not yet implemented the EMV \"chip-and-PIN\" credit card authorization system used overseas, due to the high cost of upgrading point-of-sale systems and an ongoing dispute among retailers, banks, and credit card firms over who should bear that expense. Between August 2011 and June 2012, the four big credit card networks initially announced target dates in spring 2013 for EMV implementation among their US retailers. The vast majority of retailers failed to meet that deadline. The latest targets for EMV implementation are in 2015 for most retailers, and 2017 for gas stations, although it is still unclear whether those deadlines can be met. \n Gas station pumps, selected public transportation vending machines, and some other types of automated vending machines often have credit/debit card readers. Many gas station pumps and some automated vending machines that accept credit cards ask for the ZIP code (i.e., postal code) of the U.S. billing address for the card, which effectively prevents them from accepting foreign cards (they are unable to detect a foreign card and switch to PIN authentication). However, inputting the digits only of a UK Post Code of the UK billing address, or the digits only of the postal code of the Canadian billing address (in both cases, ignore spaces and letters), and adding on as many zeros as necessary to make five digits works often enough to be worth trying and does no harm. Since July 2013, this trick is guaranteed to work for Canadians who use cards with the MasterCard logo at gas stations that require a ZIP code prompt. At gas stations you can use a foreign issued card by paying the station attendant inside. \n In many big tourist cities, watch out for merchants trying to convert your USD purchase to your home currency when using your foreign debit / credit card. This is known as dynamic currency conversion and the exchange rate, at the point of sale, is NEVER in your favor; regardless of what you are told by the merchant. Always opt to be charged in USD. You can also avoid this by buying a prepaid debit card as long as you ensure there is sufficient funds in the card. \n  Gift cards[edit]  Each major commercial establishment (e.g. store, restaurant, online service) with a statewide, regional, nationwide or online presence makes its own gift card available to consumers for use at any of its establishments nationwide or its online store. In spite of the word \"gift\" in gift card, you can actually purchase and use these cards for yourself; however, they are most commonly given to others as gifts. This is a more polite way to give someone money as a gift, and is a standard gift for someone whom you don't know very well. A gift card for a certain establishment can be purchased at any of the establishment's branches. Supermarkets and pharmacies also have a variety of gift cards from different stores, restaurants and other services. Once these are purchased by you or given to you by friends, you can use a particular store or restaurant's gift card at any of its branches nationwide or online store for any amount. In case funds in the gift card are insufficient, you can use other payment methods to pay for the balance (like cash, credit card, a 2nd gift card particular to the establishment). VISA, MasterCard and American Express gift cards work very similarly to their credit/debit card counterparts. The gift card also has instructions on how to check your remaining balance online. Take note that the gift cards are unlikely to be accepted in the establishment's branches outside the U.S. though when you return home you can still use any remaining amount in the gift card in the establishment's online store. Also keep in mind that some gift cards expire, which makes the money on them worthless so always double check if there is one and how long you have to use the gift card. \n  Sales tax[edit]  There is no nationwide sales tax (such as VAT or GST), the only exception being motor fuels like gasoline and diesel. As a result, state and/or local taxes (see below) on major purchases cannot be refunded by customs agents upon leaving the United States. \n However, most states have a sales tax, ranging from 2.9% to nearly 10% of the retail price; 4-6% is typical. Certain counties and even cities have their own sales taxes, which are added to the total tax. Sales tax is almost never included in posted prices (except for gasoline/diesel, and in most states, alcoholic beverages consumed on-premises), but instead will be calculated and added to the total when you pay. Most grocery items and a variety of other \"necessities\" are usually exempt, but almost any other retail transaction – including restaurant meals, excepting most items ordered for takeout – will have sales tax added to the total. The price displayed is rarely the final price you pay.\n Delaware, New Hampshire and Oregon have no sales tax. Alaska has no statewide sales tax, but allows local governments to collect sales taxes. Montana also has no state-wide sales tax, but a few local governments (mostly in tourism-dominated towns) are allowed to collect sales taxes. Minnesota, Pennsylvania and New Jersey do not collect sales tax on clothes. In Massachusetts, clothing is exempt from any sales tax if the item costs no more than $175 (and sales tax is collected only on the amount over $175); in New York, clothing is exempt from state sales tax statewide and local sales tax in some locations (most notably New York City) if the item costs less than $110. At least two states, Louisiana and Texas, will refund sales tax on purchases made by international travelers taken out of the state. \n Regional price variations, indirect hotel and business taxes, etc, will usually have more impact on a traveler's wallet than the savings of seeking out a low-sales-tax or no-sales-tax destination. Many cities also impose sales taxes, and certain cities have tax zones near airports and business districts that are designed to exploit travelers. Thus, sales taxes can vary up to 2% in a matter of a few miles. \n However, even accounting for the burden of sales taxes, US retail prices still tend to be much lower than in many other countries. With one exception, the US has not implemented any form of value-added tax, where each segment in the supply chain is required to charge tax on the value it adds towards the final product. Rather, US sales taxes are charged only by the retailer at the time of the sale of the final product to the consumer. This is one reason for why Americans find everything to be so expensive when they visit other countries. The sole exception is the state of Hawaii, which charges a general excise tax that is worse than a value-added tax; it is levied on the entire price of products at every segment of the supply chain, rather than just the value added. \n If you are coming to the U.S. from a higher-taxed jurisdiction in search of bargains on luxury goods, note that it is much more difficult to find most of the internationally renowned brands of luxury goods in the no-sales-tax states, as such brands have traditionally positioned their boutique stores in the largest and wealthiest states: California, Texas, New York, Illinois and Florida (all of which have sales taxes). Even if you can find a particular luxury brand in a no-sales-tax state, it will likely be only one of multiple brands carried by a local luxury retailer, meaning their inventory will not be able to match the depth of a boutique dedicated solely to that brand. \n  Places for shopping[edit]  Shopping malls and shopping centers. America is the birthplace of the modern enclosed \"shopping mall\" as well as the open-air \"shopping center\". Most large high-end malls are operated by nationwide mall operators like Westfield, Simon, or General Growth Properties. In addition, American suburbs have miles and miles of small strip malls, or long rows of small shops with shared parking lots, usually built along a high-capacity road. Large cities still maintain central shopping districts that can be navigated on public transport, but pedestrian-friendly shopping streets are uncommon and usually small. \n Outlet centers. The U.S. pioneered the factory outlet store, and in turn, the outlet center, a shopping mall consisting primarily of such stores. Outlet centers are found along major Interstate highways outside of most American cities. Simon Premium Outlets is the largest chain of outlet centers in the U.S. \n Major retailers. American retailers tend to have some of the longest business hours in the world, with chains like Walmart often featuring stores open 24/7 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Department stores and other large retailers are usually open from 10 AM to 9 PM most days, and during the winter holiday season, may stay open as long as 8 AM to 11 PM. The U.S. does not regulate the timing of sales promotions as in other countries. U.S. retailers often announce sales during all major holidays, and also in between for any reason or no reason at all. American retail stores are gigantic compared to retail stores in other countries, and are a shoppers' dream come true. \n Travelers should be aware that bargaining is generally not practiced at established stores, though it is welcome at other sales venues (see below). While asking for a price reduction due to an item defect is generally acceptable, retail sales personnel often do not have the authority to change prices and may see attempting to haggle as rude or or even threatening. If you want to ask for a discount, be polite and accept whatever answer you are given. If you don't, you may be asked to leave. \n Garage sales. On weekends, it is not uncommon to find families selling no longer needed household items in their driveway, garage, or yard. If you see a driveway full of stuff on a Saturday, it's likely a garage sale. Check it out; one person's trash may just be your treasure. Bargaining is expected and encouraged. \n Flea markets. Flea markets (called \"swap meets\" in Western states) have dozens if not hundreds of vendors selling all kinds of usually inexpensive merchandise. Some flea markets are highly specialized and aimed at collectors of a particular sort; others just sell all types of items. Again, bargaining is expected. \n Auctions. Americans did not invent the auction but may well have perfected it. The fast paced, sing-song cadence of a country auctioneer, selling anything from farm animals to estate furniture, is a special experience, even if you have no intention of buying. In big cities, head to the auction chambers of Christie's or Sotheby's, and watch paintings, antiques and works of art sold in a matter of minutes at prices that go into the millions. \n  Major U.S. retail chains[edit]   Department stores[edit]  According to Deloitte, the largest fashion goods retailer in both the U.S. and the entire world is Macy's, Inc., which operates just over 720 Macy's midrange department stores in 45 states, Puerto Rico, and Guam, plus 7 Macy's Backstage discount stores, 38 upscale Bloomingdale's stores, 16 Bloomingdale's Outlet stores, and 98 Bluemercury cosmetics stores. In other words, nearly every mall you visit will have a Macy's. \n Unfortunately, not all of them are all worth visiting. Most Macy's stores, especially in smaller cities and middle-class suburbs, tend to heavily feature midrange brands. Most brands featured in those stores are private brands (that is, the brand concept was created by and is exclusive to Macy's itself, and most of them are not associated with a famous fashion designer). Over time, Macy's, like other U.S. department stores, has shifted its product mix in favor of its own private brands over outside designer brands. Obviously, if it owns the brand, it captures more of the profits. Therefore, shopping at most Macy's stores makes sense only if you are actually a fan of Macy's private brands. \n However, in the largest U.S. cities, Macy's operates high-end regional flagship stores which feature many internationally renowned upscale designer brands, and some of those stores have visitor centers catering to international tourists. In general, you should save your time and money for Macy's regional flagship stores or its gigantic original flagship store in New York City. \n Nordstrom is another upscale department store that is also found in most states. Other upscale department stores that operate coast-to-coast include Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Barney's New York, but they are found only in the wealthiest cities. \n Besides Macy's, other midrange nationwide chains include Kohl's, Sears, and JCPenney. The lower end is dominated by Marshalls, TJ Maxx, and Old Navy. \n  Discount stores, supermarkets, and warehouse clubs[edit]  General discount stores like Walmart, Target, and Kmart are ubiquitous, as well as Walmart Supercenters and SuperTargets which are similar to hypermarkets overseas. (Kmart's hypermarket equivalents are called Super Kmarts, but they are extremely rare.) Many discount stores have either a small grocery section or a full supermarket; in fact, Walmart is the country's largest seller of groceries, as well as its largest retail chain. \n The two largest supermarket chains are Kroger and Albertsons, but both operate under legacy regional nameplates in many states. For example, in the nation's second largest city, Los Angeles, Kroger operates Ralphs and Food4Less, while Albertsons operates Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions, and neither operates any stores under their own names. And neither chain operates in the nation's largest city, New York City, where the supermarket business is severely fragmented among a huge number of regional chains. The dominant warehouse club chain in the U.S. is Costco, whose biggest competitor is Sam's Club (operated by Walmart). \n  Other chains[edit]  In several areas of the retail sector, ruthless consolidation has resulted in only one surviving nationwide chain, each of which competes with numerous regional chains and local stores. Examples include bookstores (Barnes &amp; Noble), toys (Toys \"R\" Us), housewares (Bed Bath &amp; Beyond), convenience stores (7-Eleven) and electronics (Best Buy). Both of the last two compete against several almost national chains that technically operate \"coast-to-coast\" but are notably absent from certain regions. For example, Circle K does not operate in the Mid-Atlantic states and New York City metro and Fry's Electronics is absent from most of the East Coast except Atlanta. \n Some areas of retail have two nationwide chains. The two big sporting goods chains are Sports Authority and Dick's Sporting Goods. The two big office stationery chains are Office Depot (which has absorbed OfficeMax), and Staples. \n In others, there are still three nationwide chains. The three big pharmacy chains are CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid—although virtually all Walmart, Target, and Kmart stores also have pharmacies, as do many supermarkets. \n Even if a discount store or supermarket is open 24/7, its pharmacy counter will almost never keep that schedule—it will usually have a morning-to-evening schedule and close overnight. This is only an issue if you need to fill a prescription or purchase a decongestant containing pseudoephedrine (in the latter case, pharmacists are required to record sales because it can be used to illegally make the highly addictive drug methamphetamine). \n Unlike most countries, many nonprescription OTC drugs (like analgesics and cold/flu remedies) are stocked on shelves in the publicly accessible section of the pharmacy, and that section normally remains often to the public even when the pharmacy counter is closed. Generally, such items can be paid for at any checkout location. \n U.S. pharmacies traditionally use the mortar-and-pestle as their symbol, not the green cross used by some European pharmacists (which in the U.S. is the symbol of medical marijuana). However, many U.S. pharmacies are now marked simply by the word \"pharmacy\" as part of their logo. U.S. pharmacies are far larger than their counterparts overseas because in the 1950s, they began selling soft drinks, packaged foods, and general merchandise to compete against the small discount stores (\"dime stores\") that were then widespread, and eventually displaced them altogether. Thus, if you don't see any supermarkets close to your hotel, try a pharmacy if you need to stock up on soft drinks and snacks. \n  Costs[edit]   Bald Eagles in Homer, Alaska \n \n\n Unless you live in Australia, Canada, Western Europe, or Japan, the United States is generally expensive, but there are ways to limit the damage. Many foreign visitors come to the United States for shopping (especially electronics, designer apparel, and accessories). While retail prices in the United States for luxury goods are lower than in many countries (as a result of low or nonexistent sales tax), and selection and quality are generally much better (due to the superior bargaining power of the gigantic U.S. retail chains), keep in mind that you could be charged taxes/tariffs on goods purchased abroad. That said, it's easy to go through the \"green lane\" at many airports and avoid paying any tax. \n Additionally, electronics may not be compatible with standards when you return, such as DVD region. That problem is easily avoided by using a \"region-free\" DVD/Blu-Ray player or by viewing the movies on a computer, where region codes are easy to evade. Your U.S.-bought item may not be eligible for warranty service in your home country. \n If you have generous friends from the U.S. who will give gift cards to you for some reason, the cards can sometimes help you defray some costs. \n A barebones budget for camping, hostels, and cooking your food could be $30-50/day, and you can double that if you stay at motels and eat at cheap cafes. Add on a rental car and hotel accommodation and you'll be looking at $150/day and up. \n There are regional variations too: large cities like New York and Los Angeles are expensive, while prices are usually lower in the suburbs and countryside. \n Many hotels and motels offer discounts for members of certain organizations which anyone can join, such as AAA (formerly the American Automobile Association, now generally referred to as \"Triple-A\"). If you're a member, or are a member of a club affiliated with AAA (such as the Canadian Automobile Association, The Automobile Association in the UK, or ADAC in Germany), it's worth asking at check-in. In addition, many hotels may offer senior discounts. The criteria for most is 62 (some set at 65) or older. Rates can be the same, greater, or less than AAA. Be prepared to show ID at check-in for age verification. \n  Tipping[edit]  Tipping in America is optional but is widely used and expected. While Americans themselves often debate correct levels and exactly who deserves to be tipped, generally accepted standard rates are: \n It is important to keep in mind that the legal minimum wage for restaurant waitstaff and other tip-earners is lower than minimum wage in many states, with the expectation that tips bring them up to a more \"normal\" wage. Thus, in restaurants (and certain other professions) a tip is not just a way to say \"thank you\" for service, but an essential part of a server's wages. In some states (including all states on the West Coast), it is required that employers to pay tipped employees full state minimum wage before tips and taxes. Often times servers in these states will be making $12-$15 per hour before tips, but it is still expected that you tip them as much as you would in any other state. \n Remember that while it is expected for you to tip normally for adequate service, you are not obliged to tip if your service was truly awful. If you receive exceptionally poor or rude service and the manager does not correct the problem when you bring it to their attention (and do bring the matter to their attention first), a deliberately small tip (one or two coins) will express your displeasure more clearly than leaving no tip at all. If you do decide not to leave a tip, don't be surprised if the restaurant's manager follows you out of the restaurant to ask you about the reasons for your dissatisfaction. Not leaving a tip is exceptionally rare, and something that will definitely be noticed and will definitely be looked down upon. \n If paying your bill by cash, leave a cash tip on the table when you leave (there is no need to hand it over personally or wait until it's collected), or if paying by credit card you can add it directly to the charge slip when you sign it. Look carefully, as the slip will generally inform you whether a 15% gratuity has already been added. \n Tipping is not expected at restaurants where patrons stand at a counter to place their order and receive their food (such as fast-food chains). Some such restaurants may have a \"tip jar\" by the cash register, which may be used wholly at the customer's discretion in appreciation of good service. Some tipping at a cafeteria or buffet is expected since the wait staff often clears the table for you and provides refills of drinks and such. 10% is generally considered appropriate in this case. \n The majority of jobs not mentioned here are not customarily tipped, and would likely refuse them. Retail employees or those in service positions which require high qualifications (such as doctors or dentists) are good examples. Never try to offer any kind of tip to a government employee of any kind, especially police officers; this could be construed as attempted bribery (a felony offense) and might cause serious legal problems. \n  Comics and cartoons[edit]  The United States is known worldwide for its comics and cartoon culture, especially in superheroes and supervillans such as Superman and Joker. The U.S. is also famous for its Comic Cons (Comic Conventions) as they are known for being huge and for the variety of products other than comics which now make up a minority of many such events. However, there do exist smaller, more localized \"comic book conventions\" that focus exclusively on comic books and their artists/writers. Visitors to the U.S. must be aware that it can be very difficult to find non-English cartoon DVDs and mangas. Although Spanish and French speakers will have less trouble as many DVDs nowadays have French and Spanish languages as optional choices as subtitles. Due to Japanese anime and manga being the second most popular animation products in the U.S.(after American animation and comics), it is possible to find imported anime and manga products in Japanese only. But they are usually found online or in special shops catering only to Japanese products. Due to the possibility of censorship, the localized products may or may not be presented exactly as they are in Japan. In some cases, the only option may be the localized and edited English language version. As with almost everywhere else in the western hemisphere, all DVDs are in formatted in NTSC. \n  Eat[edit][add listing]   Berries from Santa Monica's farmer's market\n \n\n While foreigners often conjure up images of hamburgers and hotdogs, there is no \"traditional\" American food and what is seen as traditional will vary widely depending on which region you are in. Many types of food found in the United States have foreign influence, but differ significantly from the cuisine of the country that it is marketed as. Therefore, the food that you find at a \"Chinese\" or a \"Mexican\" restaurant will often be very different from traditional Chinese or Mexican cuisine. \n The variety of restaurants throughout the U.S. is remarkable. In a major city such as New York or Chicago, it may be possible to find a restaurant from nearly every country in the world. One thing that a traveler from Europe or Latin America will notice is that many restaurants do not serve alcohol, or may only serve beer and wine. Some restaurants, especially in larger cities, implement a BYOB (Bring Your Own Booze) policy, in other words, you are invited to bring your own alcoholic beverages. Another is the sheer number and variety of fast food and chain restaurants. Most open early in the morning and stay open late at night; many are open 24 hours a day. A third remarkable fact is the size of the portions generally served by US restaurants. Although the trend has moderated in recent years, portions have grown surprisingly large over the past two or three decades. \n  Types of restaurants[edit]   In-n-Out burger\n \n\n Fast food restaurants such as McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, and Taco Bell are ubiquitous. But the variety of this type of restaurant in the US is astounding: pizza, Chinese and Mexican food, fish, chicken, barbecued meat, and ice cream only begin to touch on it. Alcoholic beverages are not served in these restaurants; \"soda\" (often called \"pop\" in the Midwest through Western New York and Western Pennsylvania, or generically \"coke\" in the South) or other soft drinks are standard. Don't be surprised when you order a soda, are handed a paper cup and expected to fill it yourself from the machine (refills are often free). Tea and coffee are also beverage options at nearly all American restaurants. You'll find that most Americans prefer to drink their tea iced. \n Americans tend to love their beverages ice cold so you can expect to see some fellow patrons filling their cups two-thirds with ice and then adding what would seem to be a tiny amount of the actual beverage, but this varies from person to person. Conversely, if the drink is filled for you at the counter, it is considered perfectly acceptable to request less ice, or even no ice depending on your preference. \n The quality of the food varies, but in general it will be cheap, reliable, and fairly tasty (in a mass-market sort of way - connoisseurs and \"foodies\" generally avoid these places like the plague), but the menu will be somewhat limited, and aside from a couple token healthy options, generally high in fat, carbs, and salt. The restaurants are usually clean and bright, and the service is limited but friendly. Tipping is not expected but you must clear your own table after your meal. Failure to do so is considered very rude, both by fellow customers and by the restaurant employees who will be assigned that task in your stead. \n Take-out food is very common in larger cities, for food that may take a little longer to prepare than a fast-food place can accommodate. Place an order by phone (or, at an increasing number of establishments, on the Web) and then go to the restaurant to pick it up and take it away. Many places will also deliver; in fact, in some cities, it will be easier to have pizza or Chinese food delivered than to find a sit-down restaurant. Pizza delivery is especially ubiquitous in the US; almost any town of 5,000 or more people will have at least one establishment offering delivery. The main national pizza chains are Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's, and Little Caesars. Most Pizza Huts are dine-in restaurants that also offer carry-out and delivery. Domino's and Papa John's are delivery and carry-out only. Most Little Caesars locations are carry-out only, though some now offer delivery as well. Especially in larger cities, local pizza places compete successfully against the big national chains, and many of them offer delivery. Be aware that tipping delivery personnel is considered customary, particularly as many of them deliver using their own vehicles at their own expense. There is no set percentage, but it is in addition to any delivery charge that the establishment may assess. \n  Chipotle has become a staple in America's fast casual scene\n \n\n Fast-Casual is a fairly recent new genre of restaurants that grew in popularity during the 2000's. They are places that are usually around $5-7 for a meal and involve a little bit of waiting as food is prepared fresh (although much less waiting than sit-down restaurants). They tend to be somewhat healthier than most typical fast food chains and offer distinct menus. Notable fast-casuals include: Chipotle, Moe's Southwest Grill, Noodles and Company, Panera Bread, Five Guys (a hamburger chain), and Freddies Burgers. \n Very large cities in America are like large cities anywhere, and one may select from inexpensive neighborhood eateries to extravagantly expensive full-service restaurants with extensive wine lists and prices to match. In most medium sized cities and suburbs, you will also find a wide variety of restaurants of all classes. In \"up-scale\" restaurants, rules for men to wear jackets and ties, while once de rigueur, are becoming more relaxed, but you should check first if there is any doubt. This usually only happens at the most expensive of restaurants. \n The diner is a typically American, popular kind of restaurant. They are usually individually run, 24-hour establishments found along the major roadways, but also in large cities and suburban areas. They offer a huge variety of large-portion meals that often include soup or salad, bread, beverage and dessert. They are usually very popular among the locals for breakfast, in the morning or after the bars. Diner chains include Denny's, Norm's, and (in the South) Waffle House, but there are many non-chain diners. Local, non-chain diners are particularly common along the east coast in New York, New Jersey, and Eastern Pennsylvania. \n No compendium of American restaurants would be complete without mentioning the truck stop. You will only encounter these places if you are taking an intercity auto or bus trip. They are located on interstate highways and they cater to truckers, usually having a separate area for diesel fuel, areas for parking \"big rigs\", and shower facilities for truckers who sleep in their cabs. These fabled restaurants serve what passes on the road for \"plain home cooking\": hot roast beef sandwiches, meatloaf, fried chicken, and of course the ubiquitous burger and fries -- expect large portion sizes!. In recent years the concept of the chain establishment has been adopted by truck stops as well, and two of the most ubiquitous of these, Flying J Travel Plazas and Petro Stopping Centers, have 24-hour restaurants at most of their installations, including \"all you can eat\" buffets. A general gauge of how good the food is at a given truck-stop is to note how many truckers have stopped there to eat. \n  Typical food truck setup\n \n\n The most recent newcomer to the American dining scene is the food truck. Food trucks are just what they sound like - trucks, buses or vans that have been converted into mobile restaurants. The quality of the food served ranges to greasy, poor-quality stuff served at construction sites to high-end operations serving gourmet, restaurant quality food (at surprisingly affordable prices) run by renowned chefs. Food trucks are common in large cities (especially on the West Coast), tend to set up shop where large groups of hungry people typically congregate (e.g. office parks and central business districts during lunch hours, and bars/clubs during evening hours. Most trucks are open for business during afternoon and evening hours Monday through Thursday, afternoon, evening and late night hours on Fridays, and late night hours on Saturdays. These trucks frequently use social media such as Twitter to announce to their followers where they'll be setting up on any given day. \n Some bars double as restaurants open late at night but may be off-limits to those under 21 or unable to show photo ID, and this may include the dining area. \n American restaurants serve soft drinks with a liberal supply of ice to keep them cold (and fill the glass). Asking for little or no ice in your drink is perfectly acceptable, and the drink will still probably be fairly cool. If you ask for water, it will usually be chilled and served with ice, unless you request otherwise. Unlike most other countries, if you ask for \"water,\" it will be still unless you specifically ask for \"carbonated\" or \"sparkling\" water. At bars and restaurants, water is served from the tap and is, therefore, almost always free of charge. Like most other beverages, water will be served with ice unless you request otherwise. In many (if not most) restaurants, soft drinks, tea, and coffee will be refilled for you at no extra charge, but you should ask if this is not explicitly stated. \n  Types of service[edit]   Breakfast pastry shop\n \n\n Many restaurants aren't open for breakfast. Those that do (mostly fast-food and diners), serve eggs, toast, pancakes, cereals, coffee, etc. Most restaurants stop serving breakfast between 10 and 11 AM, but some, especially diners, will serve breakfast all day. As an alternative to a restaurant breakfast, one can grab breakfast food such as doughnuts, muffins, fruits, coffee, and packaged drinks at almost any gas station or convenience store. Coffee shops (of which Starbucks is the most well-known) are popular for breakfast; although they offer pastries and other items, most people frequent them for a morning dose of caffeine. Some chains, like Dunkin' Donuts or Einstein Brothers Bagels, are sometimes liked more for their coffee than their actual food. \n Continental Breakfast is a term primarily used by hotels and motels to describe a cold breakfast offering of cereal, breads, muffins, fruit, etc. Milk, fruit juices, hot coffee and tea are the typical beverages. There is usually a toaster for your bread. This is a quick, cheap (usually free) way of getting morning food. \n Lunch is usually eaten around the noon hour and can be a good way to get food from a restaurant whose dinners are out of your price range. \n  Typical brunch plate\n \n\n Dinner, the main meal. Depending on culture, region, and personal preference, is usually enjoyed between 5 and 9pm. Many restaurants serve portions well in excess of what can normally be eaten in one sitting, and will be willing to box up your leftover food (typically referred to as a \"to go box\"). Do not feel the need to finish what you have been served. Making reservations in advance is a good idea if the restaurant is popular, \"up-scale\", or you are dining in a large group. \n Buffets are generally a cheap way to get a large amount of food. For a single, flat, rate, you can have as many servings of whatever foods are set out. However, since food can be sitting out in the heat for hours, the quality can suffer. Generally, buffets serve American or Chinese-American cuisine. \n Many restaurants serve Sunday brunch, served morning through early afternoon, with both breakfast and lunch items. There is often a buffet. Like most other meals, quality and price can vary by restaurant. \n  Types of food[edit]   Ribs with coleslaw, corn bread, and beans.\n \n\n While many types of food are unchanged throughout the United States, there are a few distinct regional varieties of food. The most notable is in the South, where traditional local fare includes grits (ground maize porridge), collard greens (a boiled vegetable, often flavored with ham and a dash of vinegar), sweet iced tea, barbecue (not unique to this region, but best and most common here), catfish (served deep-fried with a breadcrumb coating), cornbread, okra, and gumbo (a stew of seafood or sausage, rice, okra, and sometimes tomatoes). \n Barbecue, BBQ, or barbeque is a delicious American specialty. At its best, it's beef brisket, ribs, or pork shoulder slowly wood smoked for hours. Ribs are served as as a whole- or half-rack or cut into individual ribs, brisket is usually sliced thin, and the pork shoulder can be shredded (\"pulled pork\") or chopped (\"chopped pork\"). Sauce of varying spiciness may be served on the dish, or provided on the side. Various parts of the U.S. have unique styles of barbecue. Generally, the best barbecue is found in the South, with the most distinct styles coming from Kansas City, Texas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. However, barbecue of some variety is generally available throughout the country. Barbecue restaurants differ from many other restaurants in that the best food is often found at very casual establishments. A typical barbecue restaurant may have plastic dinnerware, picnic tables, and serve sandwiches on cheap white bread. Barbecue found on the menu at a fancy chain or non-specialty restaurant is likely to be less authentic. Ribs and chicken are always eaten with your fingers; pork and brisket are either eaten with a fork or put into a sandwich. Note that the further one gets from the South, the more likely that \"barbecue\" refers to food cooked on a grill with no smoking, such as hamburgers or hot dogs.\n With a rich tradition of immigration, America has a wide variety of ethnic foods; everything from Ethiopian cuisine to Laotian food is available in major cities with large immigrant populations. \n  Chinese dumplings\n \n\n Chinese food is widely available and adjusted to American tastes - by default, a \"Chinese\" restaurant will serve a menu only vaguely related to authentic Chinese food, usually meat in sugary sauce with rice and noodles, often in an all-you-can-eat buffet setting. Authentic Chinese food can be found in restaurants in Chinatowns in addition to communities with large Chinese populations. Japanese sushi, Vietnamese, and Thai food have also been adapted for the American market in recent years. Fusion cuisine combines Asian ingredients and techniques with more traditional American presentation. Indian food outlets are available in most major U.S. cities and towns. \n Mexican/Hispanic/Tex-Mex food is very popular, but again in a localized version. Combining in various ways beans, rice, cheese, and spiced beef or chicken with round flatbread loaves called tortillas, dishes are usually topped with spicy tomato salsa, sour cream, and an avocado-based dip called guacamole. Small authentic Mexican taquerias can be found easily in the Southwest, and increasingly in cities throughout the country. \n Italian food is perhaps the only cuisine that rivals Mexican for widespread popularity. All manners of pasta can be found here, and American-styled pizzas (typically a thick crust topped with tomato sauce and cheese, in addition to other meats and vegetables) are a popular choice for social events and casual dining. Italian restaurants can be found almost everywhere, and even non-specialty restaurants and grocery stores can provide you with basic pasta meals. \n  Gyros\n \n\n Middle Eastern and Mediterranean foods are also becoming popular in the United States. The gyro is a popular Greek sandwich which is similar to the Turkish Doner is made of sliced processed lamb on a pita bread topped with lettuce, tomatoes and a yogurt-cucumber sauce. Hummus (a ground chickpea dip/spread) and baklava pastries are frequently found in supermarkets, along with an increasingly widespread and high-quality array of \"pita\" products. \n Vegetarian food is easy to come by in big urban areas. As vegetarians are becoming more common in the U.S., so are the restaurants that cater to them. Most big cities and college towns will have vegetarian restaurants serving exclusively or primarily vegetarian dishes. In smaller towns you may need to check the menu at several restaurants before finding a vegetarian main course, or else make up a meal out of side dishes. Wait staff can be helpful answering questions about meat content, but be very clear about your personal definition of vegetarian, as dishes with fish, chicken, egg, or even small quantities of beef or pork flavoring may be considered vegetarian. This is especially common with vegetable side dishes in the South. Meat-free breakfast foods such as pancakes or eggs are readily available at diners. \n People on low-fat or low-calorie diets should be fairly well-served in the U.S., as there has been a continuing trend in calorie consciousness since the 1970s. Even fast-food restaurants have \"lite\" specials, and can provide charts of calorie and fat counts on request. \n For the backpacker or those on very restricted budgets, American supermarkets offer an almost infinite variety of pre-packaged/pre-processed foods that are either ready or almost ready for consumption, e.g. breakfast cereal, ramen noodles, canned soups, etc. \n In the largest cities, \"corner stores\" abound. These small convenience stores carry a variety snacks, drinks, and prepackaged foods. Unlike most convenience stores, their products are sold at relatively low prices (especially by urban standards) and can provide for snacks or even (nutritionally partial) meals for a budget no more than $5 a day. \n  Lobster tail\n \n\n  Seafood is abundant on the coasts, with freshwater and saltwater varieties of fish and shellfish (although finding squid, octopus, and jellyfish will require a bit of effort). The Northeast is famed for its Maine lobsters, and the Southeast has a variety of shrimp and conch. Most of the seafood in Florida is served spicy, as influenced by the Caribbean taste. Seafood dining on the west is equally abundant, and Alaskan salmon is served in high quantity through the Pacific Northwest. The state of Maryland is famous for its Chesapeake Bay blue crabs, which are usually steamed live in a pot with a spicy seasoning. There is a bit of a learning curve to eating Maryland crabs, though any server or local, for that matter, in a crabhouse will gladly give you a lesson. It is not recommended to wear a plastic bib or napkin when eating Maryland crabs or Maine lobster. You will be instantly pegged as a tourist. \n  Etiquette[edit]  It is usually inappropriate to join a table already occupied by other diners, even if it has unused seats; Americans prefer and expect this degree of privacy when they eat. Exceptions are cafeteria-style eateries with long tables, and at crowded informal eateries and cafes you may have success asking a stranger if you can share the table they're sitting at. Striking up a conversation in this situation may or may not be welcome, however. \n Table manners, while varying greatly, are typically European influenced. Slurping or making other noises while eating are considered rude, as is loud conversation (including phone calls). It is fairly common to wait until everybody at your table has been served before eating. You should lay cloth napkins across your lap; you can do the same with paper napkins, or keep them on the table. Offense isn't taken if you don't finish your meal, and most restaurants will package the remainder to take with you, or provide a box for you to do this yourself (sometimes euphemistically called a \"doggy bag\", implying that the leftovers are for your pet). If you want to do this, ask the server to get the remainder \"to go\"; this term will be almost universally understood, and will not cause any embarrassment. Some restaurants offer an \"all-you-can-eat\" buffet or other service; taking home portions from such a meal is either not allowed, or carries an additional fee. If you are eating with a group, it is very rude to leave before everyone else is ready to go, even if you came separately. Cleaning your plate is a sign that you enjoyed your meal, and doesn't imply that the host didn't serve enough or should bring more. \n Many fast food items (sandwiches, burgers, pizza, tacos, etc) are designed to be eaten by hand (so-called \"finger food\"); a few foods are almost always eaten by hand (french fries, barbecue, chicken on the bone) even at moderately nice restaurants. If unsure, eating finger food with a fork and knife probably won't offend anyone; eating fork-and-knife food by hand might, as it's considered \"uncivilized\" and rude. \n When invited to a meal in a private home it is considered polite for a guest to ask if they can bring anything for the meal, such a dessert, a side dish, or for an outdoor barbecue, something useful like ice or plastic cups or plates. The host will usually refuse except among very close friends, but it is nonetheless considered good manners to bring along a small gift for the host. A bottle of wine, box of candies or fresh cut flowers are most common. Gifts of cash, prepared ready-to-serve foods, or very personal items (e.g. toiletries) are not appropriate. \n An exception is the potluck meal, where each guest (or group/family) must bring a food dish to share with everyone; these shared dishes make up the entire meal. Usually dishes are grouped (e.g., salads, main dishes or casseroles, side dishes, desserts); you should ask the host if they want you to bring something in particular. Ideal dishes for a potluck should be served from a large pot, dish, or bowl, and would be spooned or forked on to diners' plates—hence the emphasis on salads, casseroles, and spoonable side dishes. Make sure to bring enough that if you and your family had to eat only that dish, they would be full, in order to ensure that there is enough food for everyone. \n  Smoking[edit]  Smoking policy is set at the state and local levels, so it varies widely from place to place. A majority of states and a number of cities ban smoking in restaurants and bars by law, and many other restaurants and bars do the same by their own policy. Some states (like New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, and California) have banned any smoking indoors, while some still allow designated smoking areas. Check local information, and ask before lighting up; if a sign says \"No Smoking,\" it means it. Breaking the ban may get you ejected, fined, or even arrested - and lots of dirty looks. Native American reservations are sovereign (independent) land and indoor smoking may be allowed on tribal lands even if you're in a state with an indoor smoking ban. In recent decades, smoking has acquired something of a social stigma (more so than in Europe)—even where smoking is permitted, be sure to ask your dining companions if they mind. With the increasing popularity of eCigarette devices, it is important to note that some establishments ask that you do not use them indoors (and in some locations, such as California, they are banned via the same laws that ban smoking). \n  Drink[edit][add listing]  Drinking customs in America are as varied as the backgrounds of its many people. In some rural areas, alcohol is mostly served in restaurants rather than dedicated drinking establishments, but in urban settings you will find numerous bars and nightclubs where food is either nonexistent or rudimentary. In very large cities, of course, drinking places run the gamut from tough local \"shot and a beer\" bars to upscale \"martini bars\". \n American tradition splits alcoholic drinks into hard liquor and others. Americans drink a wide array of hard liquors, partially divided by region, but for non-distilled spirits almost exclusively drink beer and wine. Other fermented fruit and grain beverages are known, and sold, but not consumed in great quantities; most fruit drinks are soft (meaning 'non-alcoholic', not 'low alcohol volume'). 'Cider' without further qualifiers is a spiced apple juice, and 'hard cider' is a relatively little-consumed alcoholic beverage in spite of the U.S. having been one of its most enthusiastic consumers a mere two centuries ago. Be prepared to specify that you mean a liquor or cocktail in shops not specifically dedicated to alcohol. \n Beer is in many ways the 'default' alcoholic beverage in the U.S., but gone are the days when it was priced cheaply and bought without high expectations for quality. In the last 25 years, America has seen a boom in craft brews, and cities like Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Diego, and Boston are becoming renowned among beer lovers. The various idioms for alcohol consumption frequently and sometimes presumptively refer to beer. While most American beer drinkers prefer light lagers – until the 1990s this was the only kind commonly sold – a wide variety of beers are now available all over the U.S. It is not too unusual to find a bar serving 100 or more different kinds of beer, both bottled and \"draft\" (served fresh in a cup), though most will have perhaps a dozen or three, with a half dozen \"on tap\" (available on \"draft\"). Microbreweries – some of which have grown to be moderately large and/or purchased by one of the major breweries – make every kind of beer in much smaller quantities with traditional methods. Most microbrews are distributed regionally; bartenders will know the local brands. Nowadays all but the most basic taverns usually have one or more local beers on tap, and these are generally more full of character than the big national brands, which have a reputation for being generic. Some brew pubs make their own beer in-house, and generally only serve the house brand. These beers are also typically considered superior to the big national brands. \n  Vineyards in Palisade, Colorado \n \n\n Wine in the U.S. is also a contrast between low-quality commercial fare versus extremely high-quality product. Unlike in Europe, American wines are labeled primarily by the grape (merlot, cabernet sauvignon, Riesling, etc.). The simple categories 'red', 'white', and 'rosé' or 'pink' are also used, but disdained as sole qualifiers by oenophiles. All but the cheapest wines are usually also labeled by region, which can be a state (\"California\"), an area of a state (\"Central Coast\"), a county or other small region (\"Willamette Valley\"), or a specific vineyard (\"Dry Creek Vineyard\"). (As a general rule, the narrower the region, the higher quality the wine is likely to be.) \n Cheap cask wines are usually sold in a box supporting a plastic bag; bottled wines are almost universally priced as semi-luxury items, with the exception of 'fortified wines', which are the stereotypical American answer for low-price-per-milliliter-alcohol 'rotgut'. \n All 50 U.S. states now support winemaking, with varying levels of success and respect. California wines are some of the best in the world, and are available on most wine lists in the country. The most prestigious American wine region is California's Napa Valley, although the state also has a number of other wine-producing areas, which may provide better value for your money because they are less famous. Wines from Oregon's Willamette Valley and the state of Washington have been improving greatly in recent years, and can be bargains since they are not yet as well known as California wines. Michigan, Colorado's Wine Country, and New York State's Finger Lakes region have recently been producing German-style whites which have won international competitions. In recent years, the Llano Estacado region of Texas has become regionally renowned for its wines. The Northern Virginia area, specifically Fauquier, Loudoun, and Prince William counties are also becoming well known for both their flavor, and organized wine tasting tours, supplemented by the scenery seen on the drives between locations. \n Sparkling wines are available by the bottle in up-scale restaurants, but are rarely served by the glass as they often are in western Europe. The best California sparkling wines have come out ahead of some famous brand French champagnes in recent expert blind tastings. They are comparatively difficult to find in 'supermarkets' and some non-alcoholic sparkling grape juices are marketed under that name. \n The wines served in most bars in America are unremarkable, but wine bars are becoming more common in urban areas. Only the most expensive restaurants have extensive wine lists, and even in more modest restaurants wine tends to be expensive, even if the wine is mediocre. Many Americans, especially in the more affluent and cosmopolitan areas of the country, consider themselves knowledgeable about wine, and if you come from a wine producing country, your country's wines may be a good topic of conversation. \n  America's native spirit — bourbon, straight up\n \n\n Hard alcohol is usually drunk with mixers, but also served \"on the rocks\" (with ice) or \"straight up\" (un-mixed, with no ice) on request. Their increasing popularity has caused a long term trend toward drinking light-colored and more \"mixable\" liquors, especially vodka, and away from the more traditional darker liquors such as whiskey and bourbon that many older drinkers favor. However this is not an exclusive trend and many Americans still enjoy whiskey and bourbon. \n It was formerly wholly inappropriate to drink hard liquor before 5PM (the end of the conventional workday), even on weekends. A relic of this custom is \"happy hour\", a period lasting anywhere from 30 minutes to three hours, usually between 5PM and 8PM, during which a significant discount is offered on selected drinks. Happy hour and closing time are the only presumptive customs in American bars, although 'ladies night', during which women receive a discount or some other financial incentive, is increasingly common. \n Although laws regulating alcohol sales, consumption, and possession vary somewhat by state and county, the drinking age is 21 throughout the U.S. except in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands(where it is 18). Enforcement of this varies, but if you're under 30 you should definitely be prepared to show photo ID when buying alcohol in a store or entering a bar (which often refuse admittance to \"minors\" under 21). In some states, people who are under 21 are not even allowed to be present in bars or liquor stores. A foreign passport or other credible ID will probably be accepted, but many waiters have never seen one, and it may not even be legally valid for buying alcohol in some places. As a driver's license is the most ubiquitous form of ID in the U.S. and have a magnetic strip for verification purposes, some supermarkets have begun requiring them to purchase alcohol. In such cases, it is the cash register not the cashier which prevents such purchases. It's worth noting that most American ID's have the date of birth laid out as month/day/year, while frequently other countries ID's use year/month/day or day/month/year which may cause further confusion. Using false identification to misrepresent your age is a criminal offense in all 50 states, and while most alcohol vendors will simply refuse to sell or take a blatantly fake ID away, a few also call the police which may result in prosecution. \n Most states (currently 45 of them) and Washington D.C. have found and use loupes in the federal law to allow underage drinking, example; in some states like Delaware and Mississippi, underage drinking is legal on private, non-alcohol premises(including private properties not open to the public). As long as he/she is accompanied by the physical presence of a parent or legal guardian who is over the age of 21 and has the approval to consume alcohol, but this varies. In states like Hawaii and Tennessee, Underage consumption of alcohol is allowed for religious purposes. Some states require that the alcohol must be provided by an official religious representative and/or limit the type of alcohol allowed. In states like Texas and Wisconsin, underage consumption of alcohol is allowed on alcohol-selling premises, such as a restaurant or bar, as long as the legal guardian gives the minor the alcohol and is in the presence of the legal guardian. This again varies. In states like Colorado and Nevada, underage consumption of alcohol is allowed for medical purposes. Again this varies. Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, New Hampshire, and West Virginia have no exceptions to underage alcohol consumption laws.\n Selling alcohol is typically prohibited after a certain hour, usually 2 AM. In some states, most stores can only sell beer and wine; hard liquor is sold at dedicated liquor stores. In Indiana, sales of any type of alcoholic beverage is banned statewide on Sunday, However, bars are still open and serve alcoholic beverages. Several \"dry counties\" – mostly in southern states – ban some or all types of alcohol in public establishments; private clubs (with nominal membership fees) are often set up to get around this. Sunday sales are restricted in some areas. Some Indian reservations(especially the Navajo Nation) doesn't allow any alcohol on their territory. \n Most towns ban drinking in public (other than in bars and restaurants of course), with varying degrees of enforcement. Even in towns which allow public drinking, a visible bottle (rather than one in a small bag, which is so commonly used for it as to be synonymous with public drinking) is either illegal or justifies police attention. All communities have some sort of ban on \"drunk and disorderly\" behavior, some quite stringent, and as a rule intoxication is an aggravating rather than exculpating factor in all but the most and least severe offenses. Drunk driving comes under fairly harsh scrutiny, with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08% considered \"Under the Influence\" and many states considering 0.05% \"Impaired\" - in Washington D.C. it's illegal to drive with any amount of alcohol in your system. If you're under 21, however, most states define a DUI from 0.00-0.02%. Drunk driving checkpoints are fairly common during major \"party\" events, and although privacy advocates have carved out exceptions, if a police officer asks a driver to submit to a blood-alcohol test or perform a test of sobriety, you generally may not refuse (and in certain states such as New York it is a crime in itself). DUI (\"driving under the influence\"), OUI (\"operating under the influence\") and DWI (\"driving while intoxicated\") are typically punished quite harshly, and as a foreign national it will typically mean the end of your time in the United States - even permanent residents have had their Green Cards revoked and were subsequently deported for DUI. In many jurisdictions catching and enforcing DUIs is the main job of patrolling police; it is watched for zealously and treated severely. It is also usually against the law to have an open container of alcohol anywhere in the car other than in the trunk. Some states have \"open bottle\" laws which can levy huge fines for an open container in a vehicle, sometimes several hundred dollars per container. \n If you're going out to drink with others; always assign at least one person as the designated driver of an automobile. Likewise, you can also arrange a taxi to take you back to your residence. Either way, it is way better than getting a ride in the back of a police car with a DUI on your record. \n  Nightlife[edit]   The bright lights of Sin City, Las Vegas, Nevada \n \n\n Nightclubs in America run the usual gamut of various music scenes, from discos with top-40 dance tunes to obscure clubs serving tiny slices of obscure musical genres. Country music dance clubs, or honky tonks, are laid fairly thick in the South and West, especially in rural areas and away from the coasts, but one or two can be found in almost any city. Many nightclubs in America have a large area or \"dance floor\" where people often congregate and dance to the music played by the DJ, although in some areas of the deep south, people also dance to music played by live bands as well. A lot of nightclubs also have multi colored ceiling mounted music lights to brighten up the dance atmosphere. Mostly, a lot of couples and groups go to nightclubs, though singles also go there as well. However, if you go as a single person to a nightclub, remember that, in the United States of America, it is etiquette for the ladies to ask the guys to dance with them. \n Until 1977, the only U.S. state with legalized gambling was Nevada. The state has allowed games of chance since the 1930s, creating such resort cities as Las Vegas and Reno in the process. Dubbed \"Sin City,\" Las Vegas in particular has evolved into an end-destination adult playground, offering many other after-hours activities such as amusement parks, night clubs, strip clubs, shows, bars and four star restaurants. Gambling has since spread outside of Nevada to a plethora of U.S. cities like Atlantic City, New Jersey and Biloxi, Mississippi, as well as to riverboats, offshore cruises and Indian reservations throughout the continental United States. Some states have tolerated card rooms for many years, which have since rebranded themselves as \"casinos\" (notwithstanding their lack of slot machines) to compete for business against true casinos in New Jersey, Nevada, and Indian reservations. \n State lotteries and \"scratch games\" are another, popular form of legalized gambling. However, online gaming and wagering on sports across state lines both remain illegal throughout the U.S. \n  Sleep[edit][add listing]   Classic 1950s motel in Seligman, Arizona, along Route 66 \n \n\n Virtually all hotels at check-in will ask for the name of the guest who made the reservation, then demand from that person some kind of photo identification (a passport or driver's license is normally sufficient) and a credit card to cover incidental charges. If you do not have a valid credit card, some hotels will demand a cash deposit instead. Upon check-in, a hotel front desk clerk will almost always issue you a keycard with a magnetic stripe for access to your room, although an increasing number have switched to RFID keycards, which are tapped instead of swiped. \n Business hotels are increasingly available across the country. Generally they are more expensive than motels, but not as expensive as full-scale hotels, with prices around $70 to $170. While the hotels may appear to be the size of a motel, they may offer amenities typically associated with larger hotels. Examples include Marriott International's Courtyard by Marriott and Fairfield Inn; Hilton's Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn; Holiday Inn's Holiday Inn Express; Starwood's Aloft and Four Points by Sheraton, and Hyatt Place. \n Another option are extended-stay hotels directed at business travelers or families on long-term stays (that are often relocating due to corporate decisions). These hotels often feature full kitchens in most rooms, afternoon social events (generally by a pool), and serve continental breakfast. Such \"suite\" hotels are roughly equivalent to the serviced apartments seen in other countries, though the term \"serviced apartments\" is not generally used in American English. Examples include Marriott’s ExecuStay, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites and SpringHill Suites; Extended StayAmerica; Homestead Studio Suites; Homewood Suites by Hilton; and Hyatt House. \n Hotels are available in most cities and usually offer more services and amenities than motels. Rooms usually run about $80-$300 per night, but very large, glamorous, and expensive hotels can be found in most major cities, offering luxury suites larger than some houses. Check-out and check-in times almost always fall in the range of 11am-noon and 2pm-4pm respectively. Examples of major hotel chains include Marriott, Renaissance by Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, DoubleTree by Hilton, Sheraton, Radisson, and Wyndham. Examples of upscale hotels include St. Regis, Fairmont, Waldorf Astoria, Crowne Plaza, InterContinental and Ritz Carlton. \n Note that many US cities now have \"edge cities\" in their suburbs which feature high-quality upscale hotels aimed at affluent business travelers. These hotels often feature all the amenities of their downtown/CBD cousins (and more), but at less exorbitant prices. \n In many rural areas, especially on the coasts and in New England, bed and breakfast (B&amp;B) lodging can be found. Usually in converted houses or buildings with less than a dozen units, B&amp;Bs feature a more home-like lodging experience, with complimentary breakfast served (of varying quality and complexity). Bed and breakfasts range from about $50 to $200 per night, with some places being much steeper. They can be a nice break from the impersonal chain hotels and motels. Unlike Europe, most American bed and breakfasts are unmarked; one must make a reservation beforehand and receive directions there. \n The two best-known hotel guides covering the US are the AAA (formerly American Automobile Association; typically pronounced \"Triple-A\") TourBooks, available to members and affiliated auto clubs worldwide at local AAA offices; and the Mobil Travel Guide, available at bookstores. There are several websites booking hotels online; be aware that many of these sites add a small commission to the room rate, so it may be cheaper to book directly through the hotel. On the other hand, some hotels charge more for \"drop-in\" business than reserved rooms or rooms acquired through agents and brokers, so it's worth checking both. \n For more long-term stays there are room rental options posted online such as in Craigslist which can be an afford solution for a cheap bed to crash with a bundled, flat priced rent.     WARNING: Craigslist rentals are not well monitored and have a higher risk of being dangerous or fraudulent.       \n Some unusual lodging options are available in specific areas or by prior arrangement. For example, you might enjoy staying on a houseboat in Lake Tahoe or the Erie Canal. Or stay in a treehouse in Oregon. More conventional lodging can be found at college or university dormitories, a few of which rent out rooms to travelers during the summertime. Finally, in many tourist areas, as well as big cities, one can rent a furnished house by the day. \n  Learn[edit]  Short courses may be undertaken on a tourist visa. Community colleges typically offer college-credit courses on an open-admissions basis; anyone with a high school degree or its equivalent and the required tuition payment can generally enroll. In large cities, open universities may offer short non-credit courses on all sorts of practical topics, from ballroom dance to buying real estate. They are a good place to learn a new skill and meet people. \n Studying full-time in the United States is an excellent opportunity for young adults seeking an advanced education, a chance to see a foreign country, and a better understanding of the U.S. and its people. It can be done independently by applying directly to a college for admission, or through the \"study abroad\" or \"foreign exchange\" department of a college in your own country, usually for a single term or one year. (Either approach requires, at minimum, an F or J student visa.) The latter is usually easiest; the two institutions will handle much of the arrangements, and you don't have to make a commitment to four years living in a strange country. Be forewarned, however: many state universities and private colleges are located in small towns, hundreds of miles from any big urban centers. They go out of their way to recruit lucrative international students unfamiliar with U.S. geography. Don't expect to spend your weekends in New York or Los Angeles if your college is in North Dakota unless it is part of the academic activities in your school/course. Furthermore, U.S. higher education institutions are distributed along a wide spectrum in terms of prestige, quality, and of course, cost. Outside of an elite group of about 20 to 40 internationally renowned universities, most U.S. colleges and universities aren't that well-known outside of their home state, let alone their home city. \n The common requirements to study at a higher education level will include your admissions essay (also known as the statement of purpose or personal statement), transcript of records, recommendation/reference letters, language tests (TOEFL is most widely accepted but it can be waived if your previous school primarily used English as a medium of instruction), standardized achievement tests (SAT or ACT for undergraduate, GMAT for graduate business schools, GRE for most other graduate programs), degree certificates. As the TOEFL, SAT, GMAT or GRE are administered by the New Jersey-based ETS, you can sit the exam in your home country well beforehand and arrange for your scores to be directly sent to the school you are applying to. You may need to present these documents including your acceptance letter when applying for a student visa. \n The types of schools vary dramatically. (In conversation, Americans tend to use the terms \"school\" and \"college\" inclusively: any college or university might be referred to as \"school\", and a university might be called \"college\".) State university systems are partially subsidized by state governments, and may have many campuses spread around the state, with hundreds of thousands of students. Private colleges are generally smaller (hundreds or a few thousand students), with a larger percentage of their students living on campus; some are affiliated with churches and may be more religious in character. Community colleges are well subsidized, and very inexpensive, but are poorly known, with varying quality. Other kinds of colleges focus on teaching specific job skills, education for working adults, and providing inexpensive college-level education to local residents. Although nearly all colleges are open to students regardless of race, gender, religion, etc. many were originally established for a particular group (e.g. African-Americans, women, members of a particular religion) and may still attract primarily students from that group. Several private colleges remain female-only, there are a few male-only private colleges, and private religious colleges may expect students to practice the school's faith. \n Colleges are funded by \"tuition\" charged to the student, which is often quite expensive, very commonly reaching into the tens of thousands of dollars per year. The most selective colleges (and hence, often the most desirable) run up to $40,000-50,000 per year, including both tuition and \"room &amp; board\" in that price. Most US citizens and eligible non-citizens receive substantial financial assistance from the federal government in the form of grants and low-interest loans, which are not available to most non-residents. Often financial aid for foreign students is provided by their home country. They may be eligible for privately-funded \"scholarships\" intended to provide educational opportunities for various kinds of students. Some U.S. banks offer loans to foreign students, which usually require a citizen to guarantee that they'll be repaid. Contact the Financial Aid Office of any college you are interested in attending for more information about the sources of aid available. \n Almost all US colleges and universities operate web sites (in the .edu domain) with information for prospective students and other visitors. \n  Work[edit]  Work in America is best arranged long before you enter the United States. Young people who are full time students of certain nationalities can apply for a J1 \"Exchange Visitor\" visa which permits paid work as au pairs or summer work for up to 4 months in virtually any type of job. The United States Department of State has full information on applying for this type of visa including the precise categories that qualify. \n The H-1B visa allows a limited number of skilled and certain unskilled employees to temporarily work in the United States. It usually requires a bachelor's degree and is based on a petition filed by an American employer. The job you wish to apply for should be related to your degree. The most common careers of hard-to-get H-1B visa holders are nurses, math teachers, and computer science professionals. The H1-B cap was filled the day applications started this year, although proposed immigration changes would increase the cap. On the other hand, there is the more permanent employment-based immigrant visa which has similar requirements to the H-1B visa. An employment-based green card is significantly harder to obtain than an H1B, because the employer needs to first go through a tedious labor certification process, and assuming USCIS approves the petition, lengthy backlogs may occur (depending on nationality). \n Paid work is generally not allowed on a B1/B2 visitor visa. Working unlawfully in the United States runs the very real risk of arrest, deportation, and ineligibility to re-enter the country for at least some time. Illegal immigrants also run the risk of working in dangerous conditions without much relief from the law. Note that \"paid work\" includes receiving any sort of compensation or thing of value in exchange for your labor including \"volunteering\" in exchange for lodging. \n If you are seeking to adjust visa status or to enter the U.S. on a working visa you should first check the official government websites of the US Department of State, which issues visas abroad, and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services which administers immigration programs within the United States. Unfortunately, con artists both in the US and overseas often prey on people's desire to travel or work here. Keep in mind that while visa applications do not usually require an attorney or other intermediary, be wary of and verify any \"advice\" offered by third parties, especially non-lawyers. If in doubt about properly applying for such visas, it is best to get a licensed immigration attorney. \n Keep in mind that anyone entering under the Visa Waiver Program cannot adjust their status for any reason. \n  Minimum Wage[edit]  Federal Minimum Wage is currently at $7.25 an hour. However, most states, the Federal District of Columbia, and all territories have their own set minimum wage. These are almost all higher than this federal minimum and wage floors can also be set even at county or municipal level (city, town or village). For example; minimum wage in the State of California is currently $10.50 an hour, but the City of San Francisco is currently $14.00 an hour, the highest in the U.S., and Seattle is scheduled to eclipse the country by 2022, gradually increasing to $15.00 an hour. While in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), the lowest in the nation because federal labor laws don't apply to the N.M.I. Minimum wage for tips is $2.13 an hour, again, this varies by state, territory, and municipality. Georgia and Wyoming have a minimum wage for at home workers is $5.15 an hour and some states such as Oklahoma allows a $2 minimum wage for certain workers under small businesses with less than 10 employees and $150,0000 or less in profits. But most are lower than federal minimum wage and others are at the same rate as the minimum wage set by the State, Federal District, or municipality.Note:Minimum wage doesn't often include health insurance coverage. And be aware of the property of which you are working on as it could be a Federal enclave, and a state's minimum wage law will not apply to the Federal enclave. Also note that overtime pay which is extra applies to most workers although it also has many exemptions so do your research. \n  Corruption[edit]  Bribery and other corrupt practices are illegal and most Americans will at best pass on your offer and at worst report it to the police and be offended. \n  Stay Safe[edit]  American movies, television shows, and music videos often give foreigners the impression that the US is filled with extremely high levels of violent crime. While there are some locations in the United States with high crime rates, most violent crime is heavily concentrated in certain inner city neighborhoods (most of which are specifically identified in the relevant city-specific articles in this travel guide), or poor outlying areas. Few visitors to the US experience any sort of crime. If you experience anything unsafe, you may call the emergency number 911. \n Much crime is gang- or drug-related in inner city regions or poor areas located along the US-Mexican border. It mostly occurs in areas that are of little interest to visitors, however, it can and does also occur in high tourist areas of certain cities. You can all but ensure that you won't experience crime by taking common-sense precautions and staying alert to your surroundings. Locations frequented by tourists and visitors (National Mall in Washington DC, and Manhattan in NYC) often have a police presence and are quite safe for all but the most minor petty crimes (eg: pickpocketing). \n Like other regions of the world, many American urban areas have populations of homeless people, some of whom are drug-addicted and/or mentally ill. In certain cities, aggressive panhandling is a concern. If you feel you are being harassed, say NO firmly and walk away and/or call the police. \n Note that security has increased along the US–Mexico border due to increased illegal immigration and drug-related crime. Only cross the country's borders at official ports of entry. \n  Police[edit]  Despite the sometimes negative coverage that law enforcement receives in the U.S. media, you will find that the vast majority of American law enforcement personnel are very professional, and take their responsibility to serve and protect the public very seriously. There is no reason to hesitate to engage law enforcement if needed during your travel in the U.S. \n If stopped by the police while driving, the driver is expected to stay in the car and wait for the police officer to come to the driver or passenger window. Turn on your interior car lights if it is dark, and keep your hands on the wheel so they remain visible. Do not attempt to exit the vehicle unless told to do so. It is expected for the driver to roll down the window the officer is at. When stopped you should stay calm, be polite and cooperative, and avoid making sudden movements. If you need to reach for your purse or wallet to present your identification, state what you are doing and wait for permission to do so. Often police will ask you to keep your hands out of your pockets and in view while speaking to them. This is in no way meant to be offensive but is for their peace of mind and your safety. American police are always armed on duty and will respond with force if they believe you present an immediate threat to them or to the public. Do not act aggressively or angrily, as that can and will make a police officer suspicious at worst, or at best will make the officer disinclined towards leniency. Contrary to many sensationalized media reports, very few officers have racial prejudices, at least that they allow to impact their work, but you do not want to be on the wrong side of one that does, as officers that abuse their power very often see little to no punishment for their actions so long as they can make a case that you were deemed to be a threat, which is very easy for them to do under the present American justice system. Patrol stops typically result in a written citation for a driving offense, or sometimes a simple verbal warning if the offense was minor, as long as you remain appropriately cooperative. If they ask to search your vehicle, you may have the right to refuse it. Be aware that the odor of illegal substances is considered probable cause for a search under the laws of most U.S. states. Always be polite and calm, and if you believe you are being treated unfairly, ask the officer if you can speak with a supervisor. \n If you are being detained, unlike in many other nations, in the U.S. an individual arrested or detained for an alleged crime is entitled to the services of an attorney, even if you are unable to afford one, in which case one will be appointed for you. All States directly employ licensed attorneys as 'public defenders' precisely for this purpose. Additionally, law enforcement in most cases may not detain a person for more than 24 hours without formally charging (arraigning) that person with a crime. This is true even if you are not a citizen or legal resident of the U.S. \n Do not offer bribes to a police officer in any way or under any circumstances. While bribery may be expected in other countries, the opposite is true in most parts of the US; bribery is actually a crime for which one can and will be arrested and detained. Foreigners are seldom given the benefit of the doubt if they are from a country where bribery is common. Even a vague gesture that could be interpreted as an attempt at bribery will offend the officer. If you need to pay a fine, the officer can direct you to the appropriate police station, courthouse, or government office. Most minor traffic infractions can be paid by mail. Don't even think about paying a fine directly to the officer who cited you, since that will probably be interpreted as a bribe. An exception to this rule is found in Montana, where fines can be paid to the officer by cash, check, or even a credit or debit card. There are a few places though where police corruption tends to be more common of an issue, such as Chicago or Detroit. If you do pay a bribe in one of those cities, be aware it may be a sting operation, as those cities are aware about the high amounts of dishonesty and are trying to lower it every chance they get. \n  Disabled[edit]  People with disabilities are treated with respect and kindness in the US. Asking someone what their disability is, how they got it, etc is considered rude. Only close friends should really ask. Shaming or mocking those with disabilities is not acceptable. Service dogs are often used for those not only with physical disabilities, but also invisible mental or social disabilities. Petting these dogs, distracting or taking photos of them without permission is frowned upon. You are expected to ignore these dogs unless told otherwise. If you must, ask the person questions without distracting the animal. They are working dogs, not necessarily pets. \n  Texting and driving[edit]  Distracted driving is a major problem in the United States, but despite the high dangers, Texting and driving is not considered illegal under federal law. But each state, territory, and Washington D.C. has laws on distracted driving. In some states, if you kill someone while texting and driving, you can get charged, and punished for murder. According to the Governors Highway Safety Administration, no state, territory, nor Washington D.C. except Illinois bans all uses of cellphone while driving. So when driving or crossing the street, it's best to be aware of distracted driving. \n  911 Emergency services[edit]  During any emergency, dialing 911 (pronounced \"nine-one-one\") on any telephone will connect you to a dispatcher for the emergency services in the area (police, fire, ambulance, etc). Calls to 911 are free from pay phones and any mobile phone capable of connecting to any local carrier. Give the facts, the dispatchers will send help. With a landline, the 911 operator can almost certainly trace your line instantly and pinpoint the exact structure you are calling from. When it comes to mobile phones, virtually all mobile phones have incorporated Enhanced 911 (or E-911) that will send a GPS location during the call that the operator can direct units to that location even if the caller is incapacitated. There may be cases where you may be connected to the regional office for the state police or highway patrol, which will then have to transfer you to the appropriate local agency once they talk to you and determine what you need. There are also cases where the complete opposite will occur where you will be transferred from a local office to a regional office if the location is under a different jurisdiction (ex. a state highway). Regardless, it is important to always give your location and a reference when calling 911, as well as answer to the best of your ability all questions that you are asked. \n If you are staying in one area, it may be helpful to have the phone numbers for the local emergency services so as to get through directly to the local dispatch. Moreover, in most locations, 911 calls are recorded and are open public records, while the conversation with the local emergency dispatchers cannot be accessed by the public. Remember that if you dial emergency dispatchers directly instead of through 911, the operator may not be able to trace your location. \n If you speak a language other than English or Spanish, it is not likely that the dispatcher you reach will be able to understand. Stay on the line and the dispatcher will open up a conference call with a translator who can help. Language barriers are not a reason to forgo calling 911 in the United States. In any case, your location can be determined and some type of help, often a police officer, will be sent to you to determine the problem. \n All US carriers automatically redirect 112 calls (the standard emergency number for GSM devices) to 911 and all 911 calls will go through even if it must connect to a different carrier or your service has been suspended. \n As with most countries, misuse of the emergency services number will result in, at the very least, a call back from authorities; if particularly egregious, you will be heavily fined or even arrested. With that being said, if you end up pocket dialing 911, which has become more common, let the dispatcher know that you are not dealing with an emergency instead of hanging up so that someone is not sent to deal with the situation. Dispatchers are aware that these mistakes happen. \n  Border Patrol[edit]  You may encounter the United States Border Patrol if you're transiting through or visiting cities geographically close to Canada (such as Detroit) or Mexico (San Diego) as well as in Southern coastal areas (Florida Keys). Border Patrol has the authority to verify immigration status and enforce immigration laws in places designated as \"border zones\" — generally within 40 miles of Canada and 75-100 miles of Mexico (although the law allows for 100 miles from any border, including international bodies of water like the seas and Great Lakes; this includes the entirety of some states and the majority of population centers). Border patrol is visible near Canada, though less so than on the southern border, (with guards primarily checking domestic long distance buses, Amtrak trains and their associated terminals, and rarely air travelers on arrival or departure). On the border with Mexico and in Southern coastal areas, systematic vehicle checkpoints or being pulled over by Border Patrol for a document check is much more common. \n Foreign nationals are legally required to have a passport, visa, and I-94(W) entry record (or Green Card) in their possession at all times. Consequences for not having them during a document check may be severe; you may be delayed or detained until your status can be verified. Long-term visa holders and permanent residents have been fined, or in extreme cases had their visas canceled for being found without their documents. If your documents are in order, you generally won't be questioned. Even US citizens are increasingly being advised to carry proof of citizenship, or at the very least identification of some kind, in areas under Border Patrol jurisdiction. \n Border Patrol does not have much of a presence outside the border zones; its inland counterpart, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, generally doesn't target tourists unless it suspects them of trying to work during their tourist visits. In most states, police and other local authorities cannot question you about your immigration status or ask to see passports or visas unless you're arrested and charged with a crime, and then only for the purpose of connecting you with a representative from your country's embassy or diplomatic mission. \n  Natural disasters[edit]  The U.S. is a huge country with varied geography, and parts of it are occasionally affected by natural disasters: hurricanes in June through November in the Gulf and Atlantic coastal states, including Florida, extreme heat throughout the country, blizzards and extreme cold in the far north, large and violent tornadoes mostly in the Great Plains, the Mid-West, and the South, floods in areas all over the United States, wildfires in the late summer and early fall in the west, dust storms in any arid areas, and tsunamis, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions in the west, as well as large thunderstorms throughout the country. See the regions in question for more details. \n Because tornadoes are so common between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains, this area has earned itself the colloquial name Tornado Alley. The west of the country sits along the pacific ring of fire, and as a result, is an area very prone to tectonic and geothermal disasters. \n  Gay and lesbian[edit]  Homosexuality is legal between consenting adults in all states as of 2003, and same-sex marriage was legalized in all states in 2015. Some states and cities have anti-discrimination codes, including public accommodations in hotels, restaurants and transportation and some states don't have it. Some Americans take a live-and-let-live approach to sexuality, but there are many significant exceptions. In a lot of regions of the US it is emphatically discouraged to open about one's sexual orientation and you will receive unwanted attention, remarks, threats, violent attacks, be physically attacked with police unsympathetic to your need for help or complicit, and be refused service. A significant amount of this occurs in Texas, Wyoming, the Midwest and the South. Attitudes toward homosexuality vary widely in regions with a reputation for tolerance. Tolerance is in some major cities throughout the country specifically around the Pacific Coast, some parts of the Northeast and Hawaii. Gay-friendly destinations include New York's Chelsea, Rochester in Western New York State, Cape Cod in Massachusetts, Chicago's Boystown, Seattle's Capitol Hill, San Francisco's Castro Street, Washington's Dupont Circle, Miami Beach's South Beach, Atlanta's Midtown and Los Angeles' West Hollywood. Massachusetts is sometimes tolerant depending on whether or not you are in a strongly religious area, which many areas of Massachusetts are. An increasing number of resort areas are known as gay-friendly, including Fire Island, Key West, Asheville, Provincetown, Ogunquit, Rehoboth Beach, Saugatuck, and parts of Asbury Park. In a few smaller cities, there are neighborhoods where gay people tend to congregate and have resource centers for LGBT people. Some gay-friendly businesses like to advertise themselves as such with a rainbow flag or a small pink triangle or three-vertical-striped sticker in the window. Men planning to engage in any sex, should be aware the heightened risk of HIV and other infections in the United States. A gay American man is 44 times more likely to contract HIV than a heterosexual one, and 46 times more likely to contract syphilis. This risk grows greatly among men likely to engage in one-night stands and other higher-risk behavior. In a nation where 0.5% of the population are HIV-positive, unprotected sex is a very real risk. Precautions, including safer sex, are strongly advised during your stay. Most cities have affordable or free testing and treatment centers for STIs at least for gay men, though hours may be limited and waits may be long. Lesbians and trans face the same risk. The life-long repercussions of HIV or other STIs aren't covered by healthcare providers and seeking health care elsewhere can be very pricey. \n  Illicit drugs[edit]  Street drugs, including but not limited to cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamines, are illegal under federal law throughout the US. \n Marijuana use is more widely accepted than other drugs. Although a few states have passed laws legalizing the medical and recreational use of marijuana, this will not protect any foreign citizen caught in possession. Outside of drug-using circles, most Americans frown upon illicit drug use regardless of quantity. This is especially true in more conservative jurisdictions. And travelers would be wise to avoid using such substances in the United States, even in the jurisdictions that allow it. Penalties can be very severe, and can include mandatory minimum jail terms for possession of personal quantities in some states. Also, ANY drug possession near a school, however slight the quantity, will land you a heavy jail term. Attempting to bring any quantity into the US posses a serious risk of being arrested for \"trafficking\". \n  Legal marijuana[edit]  Notable exceptions to the precautions above are the states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) and several recognized Indian Reservations, which have all recently legalized recreational use of marijuana. According to these new local laws, you can possess up to 1 ounce (8 ounces in Oregon, 2.5 ounces in the city of Portland, Maine, 2.5 ounces in Michigan and 2 ounces in Washington D.C.) of marijuana from a licensed seller and use it personally if you are over 21 years old. Indian Reservations have recently been allowed by the Federal government to regulate cannabis on their recognized reservation, so laws within the reservation vary widely, and can be different from state laws. Example; while cannabis is legal in the state of Washington, the Yakima Nation (an Indian reservation in Washington State) declares cannabis illegal on their land. So by default, both federal and laws of the Indian Reservation apply. However, use on public streets or inside public buildings is illegal, so if you do use it, use it in private. Law enforcement usually ignores marijuana use on private property (i.e., inside someone's home), but caution should be exercised as police can arrest you for marijuana use in states where it is not legal, and drug crimes can carry surprisingly stiff sentences and will result in deportation for foreigners. \n The federal government of the United States still considers marijuana illegal, so the use is still illegal in territory under direct federal government jurisdiction within states where marijuana use has legalized such as the Lewis-McChord Military Reservation in Washington state, and all National Parks, National Forests, and other public lands under federal jurisdition. Likewise, mailing of marijuana from Washington state to Colorado through the US Postal Service or bringing in some 'BC Bud' from British Columbia to Washington state is still illegal. The future of these laws is uncertain, but for now, they stand (with the exceptions in recognized Indian Reservations and federal territory). \n Marijuana possession and use is still illegal everywhere else, so do NOT under any circumstances bring marijuana into any U.S. jurisdiction where it is illegal, nor across adjacent international borders. This includes any Indian Reservation that deems it illegal on their land as you will risk facing criminal charges if you are caught with it. Depending on which country of your residence or you're traveling to after leaving the U.S., you may face criminal charges in your home country (or a third country) if found in possession of cannabis (or even in very small amounts) on arrival from the U.S. or having it in your urine or through other means of testing for drug use from a person's body, even if it was completely consumed in the U.S. prior to departure. The US reports crimes to other countries even ones who enforce the death penalty for drug offences so keep that in mind. \n Do not bring cannabis or any other federally illegal drug onto any Federal enclave, as federal drug laws are heavily enforced. \n  Racism[edit]  Most travelers to the US will not encounter overt racism, but latent racism still exists. Certain towns and cities have \"no-go\" areas for certain ethnicities, where hostility can be felt, although tourists are unlikely to travel to such localities and even unlikelier to face actual harm. There is an extremely small chance of running into someone who is a member of a supremacist group such as, the Ku Klux Klan or other \"Neo-Nazi\" or various other hate groups. Symbols like swastikas and other Nazi imagery are legal in the US, and may be found in tattoo art among members. However, they usually cover these up in public to avoid drawing hostility from others. For the most part, racist hate groups tend to prefer to be reclusive due to the mainstream unpopularity of their views. Most such groups choose to inhabit remote, rural, isolated areas (some of which may be crudely constructed compounds) that are difficult for outsiders to come upon incidentally. Occasionally, they may appear in public just to exercise their \"free speech rights\", even if they don't intend to commit any violent or obviously illegal acts. \n  Islam[edit]  Islam is generally less prevalent in the United States than in many other Western countries This fact, along with well-publicized terrorist attacks performed by such extremist groups as ISIS and al-Qaeda, means some Americans harbor resentment towards Muslims and Islam, particularly in rural and suburban areas. However, this is not necessarily a majority view, especially in larger cities. Additionally, Muslims are generally not discriminated against on a personal level, and hate crimes are very rare. However, Muslims should use special caution and consideration when traveling in public at night, while wearing traditional or religious apparel, or while in areas outside of large cities. \n  Judaism[edit]  Although the USA has always been a safe and welcoming place for Jewish residents and visitors and anti-Semitic hate crimes are extremely rare, anti-Semitism has been on the increase over the past two decades and observant Jews should exercise special caution and consideration when traveling in public while wearing traditional or religious apparel, particularly in inner-city urban areas, on university campuses, and areas where extreme left or right-wing views are common. There have been several high-profile attacks on Jews, including recent synagogue shootings in Pittsburgh and San Diego. If you ever feel like you're in danger call 911 immediately. \n  Curfew[edit]  Some cities don't allow minors below a certain age to wander alone after a certain hour at night, unless accompanied by a legal guardian. Similar rules may apply to driving. \n  Animals[edit]  It is illegal to hunt, kill, or keep any of a bald eagle's feathers. Keeping its feathers will result in a $100,000 fine for each feather you possess. As well as a year in prison, repeated offenses will change your sentence. However, Indian reservations are somewhat excluded from the possession of bald eagle feathers. But you must have a certification of tribal membership and the appropriate registration license to possess one. If not, federal law applies. The U.S. has one of the highest populations of venomous snakes (32), and a high number of potentially dangerous animals compared to many other countries. Please exhibit caution in any wilder areas of the country (even suburban areas.). Animal fighting and abuse is illegal. \n  Prostitution[edit]  Prostitution is not prohibited by Federal law. States, Territories, and the Federal District are allowed to make their own laws. Even so, prostitution remains illegal in all areas except at licensed brothels in rural Nevada counties. Prostitution remains illegal in Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada, and street-walking prostitutes are always illegal. Elsewhere in the US, tolerance and enforcement of prostitution laws vary considerably, but be aware that police routinely engage in \"sting\" operations in which an officer may pose as a prostitute to catch and arrest persons offering to pay for sex. This is not considered entrapment by US laws since the arrested person was consciously intending to commit an illegal act. \n  Firearms[edit]  Legal ownership of firearms is supported by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution, most (but not all) of the fifty states have similar wording in their state constitutions. Because of this, the U.S. has become a major destination for \"Gun tourism\", and currently the largest destination. \n Many Americans (but certainly not all) own a firearm, and firearm ownership is legal in all jurisdictions with varying degrees of restriction by State, Territory, and Federal District. Legally carried firearms can range from hunting rifles and shotguns to revolvers and semi-automatic handguns. \n Non-immigrant aliens that are in the country for fewer than 180 days cannot possess a firearm or ammunition, unless they came here specifically for hunting or sporting purposes, or they have a valid hunting license from the state they are visiting. Passport + Visa + State Issued Hunting License = firearm possession / use. Entry in a recognized shooting competition can substitute for the hunting license. Anything else is strictly illegal. \n The vast majority of Americans are non-violent except in self defense; they are responsible with their firearms and use/carry them appropriately and within the limits of the law. All States have laws regarding self defense which allow a person to use force, up to and including deadly force, in defense of themselves or others when in reasonable fear of serious bodily injury or death. This right to self-defense, including armed force, extends to protection of one's home, and, in some states, to other types of personal property. \n Your chances of a firearm-related injury in the U.S.A. are very low, but please keep the following in mind: \n If you come from a country where firearm ownership is heavily restricted, discouraged or prohibited, there is a possibility that your American host will offer to take you shooting. On a shooting trip, your host will most likely explain basic firearm safety and quiz you on it before allowing you to handle their guns. They may also watch you closely and point out any accidental safety violations. This is all done out of gun safety concerns, and should never be interpreted as impertinent or disrespectful. \n  Self-Defense[edit]  Laws about self defense vary between states and depending on the situation can allow for very loose or very strict definitions of what calls for it. California or New York are examples of states where it requires more immediate danger to be allowed. Attitudes taken in the South, Texas, and Rocky Mountains (United States of America), even tresspasers are seen as dangerous on private property and may be shot if seen as a threat. All States do allow for deadly force from citizens and police officers if they are in fear of their life. Read up on the policies before coming to know what the laws your State have on defending yourself. \n  Mass Shootings[edit]  Incidents of mass shootings happen, but account for a small percentage of homicide deaths in the country. The likelihood of you being a victim of such an incident is low. However, the international human rights organization. Amnesty International issued a travel warning to potential travelers to the United States to \"exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the country due to rampant gun violence, which has become so prevalent in the United States that it amounts to a human rights crisis\" within the country. \n  Stay healthy[edit]   Personal hygiene[edit]  The average American takes a bath or shower at least once per day, and expects others to do the same. Excessive body odor is frowned upon, as is excessive use of perfumes and colognes. \n American men either shave their faces daily, or if they grow beards and/or mustaches, keep them neatly trimmed. American women shave their legs if walking around in shorts or high-cut skirts that expose bare skin. Most also shave their underarms and some shave their arms. \n Bad breath (halitosis) is also frowned upon. Americans are taught from a young age to brush and floss their teeth twice daily. \n  Disease[edit]   \n NOTE: The CDC has identified the territories of American Samoa, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, as well as parts of Miami in the state of Florida and Houston and South Texas as an affected area of the Zika outbreak. Pregnant women are advised to be cautious as the virus can lead to birth defects. Adults affected by the virus experience fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes) typically lasting a week. You can learn more by visiting the official CDC website. \n \n \n Being a highly industrialized nation, the United States is largely free from most serious communicable diseases found in many developing nations; however, the HIV rate is higher than in Canada and Western Europe, with about a 0.5% infection rate in the overall population. This is due to Americans being more likely to have multiple partners at younger ages (down to 12 years of age,) than residents of Canada or Western Europe. \n Two diseases that, while rare, are worth becoming educated about are rabies and Lyme disease. Rabies is more prevalent in eastern regions of the country and may be contracted from animal bites; if you are bitten by any mammal see a doctor quickly—do not wait for symptoms. Lyme disease is spread via the deer tick, which are prevalent in the woodlands and open fields of many rural areas. When venturing into the outdoors, it is a good idea to apply an insect repellent onto exposed skin surfaces that is effective against deer ticks. \n Other diseases that are endemic within the United States, but are of far less concern, include Hantaviral Pulmonary Syndrome (found in western regions), Dengue fever (in areas from the southern Mid-West down to the Gulf and Hawaii,) Chikungunya (almost all regions,) Bubonic Plague (Pacific Northwest,) Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (mostly in the Rocky Mountain region), West Nile Virus (all regions)and Eastern/Western Equine Encephalitis (particularly in the mid-west region). \n All of the above listed diseases are extraordinarily rare and the medical system of the United States is very much capable of handling any of these when necessary. \n For the latest in traveler's health information pertaining to the United States, including advisories and recommendations, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website.\n  Health care[edit]  Health care in America is arguably the best but among the most expensive in the world. The vast majority of working Americans have health insurance for themselves and their family, for those who don't the Affordable Care Act (commonly called \"Obamacare\" by Americans) enacted by President Barack Obama in 2010 helped to alleviate the problem. Americans generally use private health insurance, paid either by their employer or out of their own pocket; some risk paying high hospital bills themselves, or depend on government subsidized health plans. If you are at least 65, then your medical coverage is covered through the national Medicare system. As a traveler you should have travel insurance or you will potentially face very high costs if you need medical care. \n Most metropolitan areas will have a mix of public and private hospitals, and in turn, US private hospitals can be either non-profit or for-profit. Public hospitals located in wealthy suburbs can be as good as private ones, but in poorer inner-city areas, public hospitals are usually overcrowded and run-down and should be avoided by tourists. However, many public hospitals are also the Level I regional trauma centers for their respective metro areas (i.e., they guarantee 24-hour on-site availability of all major types of medical specialists), which means that you will be taken there if critically injured. \n In a life-threatening emergency, call 911 to summon an ambulance to take you to the nearest hospital emergency room (\"ER\"), or in less urgent situations get to the hospital yourself and register at the ER's front desk. Emergency rooms will treat patients without regard to their ability to pay, but you will still be presented with a bill for all care. Note: if you use an ambulance to get to a hospital you will have to pay extra for that. Do not use ERs for non-emergency walk-in care. Not only can this be 3-4 times more expensive than other options, but you will often wait many hours (or days) before being treated, as the staff will give priority to patients with urgent needs. In most areas, the charge for an emergency room visit starts around $500, in addition to any specific services or medications you may require. Most urban areas have minor emergency centers (also called \"urgent care\", etc.) for medical situations where a fully equipped emergency room would be excessive, such as superficial lacerations. However, their hours may be limited, and few are open overnight. \n Walk-in clinics are another place for travelers to find routine medical care, letting patients see a doctor or nurse-practitioner without an appointment (but often with a bit of a wait). They are typically very up-front about fees, and always accept credit cards. To find one, check the yellow pages under \"Clinics\", or call a major hospital and ask. Make sure to tell the clerk you will be paying \"out of pocket\"; if they assume an insurance company will be paying for it, they may order tests that are not medically essential and in some cases bill for services that aren't actually provided. \n Dentists are readily available throughout the United States (again, see the yellow pages). Dental offices are accustomed to explaining fees over the phone, and most will accept credit cards. Be prepared to pay for all services up front as this is a common requirement for most dental practices. \n Please note the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly referred to by Americans as Obamacare (named after the U.S. President Barack Obama who started the idea) is a law that requires everyone to have affordable health insurance to avoid paying a hefty price on their medical bills. It took effect March 1, 2014. It is however, not applicable to U.S. visitors so if you get sick you have to pay full price for medical bills. \n Most counties and cities have a government-supported clinic offering free or low-cost testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases; call the Health Department for the county you are in for more details. Many county clinics offer primary health care services as well, however these services are geared towards low-income residents and not foreign travelers. \n  Restrooms/Toilets[edit]  The full-time restroom attendants often seen in certain European countries are extremely rare in the US. Some facilities may be pristine, such as in upscale shopping malls, fine restaurants, or commercial office buildings. Others will be shockingly unkempt, such as at many gas stations and bars. Public universities and big box retail stores will have a medium level of cleanliness. Nearly all public buildings are required to have restrooms accessible to the disabled. Many restrooms increasingly offer baby changing stations in both the men's and women's restrooms (especially in shopping centers and restaurants). A few places offer a separate, third \"family\" restroom which is single-occupancy but spacious. For little children who need to be monitored or assisted, it's generally acceptable for them to use the restroom of the parent they're with (little girls can go with dad to the men's room, and vice versa). The other way around (dad going to the ladies' room) is usually not okay. North Carolina had a law that transgender people use the bathrooms that match their biological sex, but it was repealed in March of 2017, a year after having been passed. \n  Water[edit]  Tap water is generally chlorinated and may also include fluorine. Nevertheless, some Americans use filter pitchers (common brands for both include Brita and Pur). Although tap water is not dangerous, some Americans prefer to filter (and sometimes boil) tap water before drinking. It has more to do with taste than actual safety. \n Ice in restaurants is typically made with ice machines. Water is always served for free in restaurants. \n Truly isolated rural areas or sources in condemned buildings may be suspect water sources-use your best judgement-but this is exceptionally rare. \n While tap water in most urban and suburban areas is safe to drink, many Americans are more comfortable drinking either filtered or bottled water. This should not be seen as a sign that the water is unsafe, rather that some prefer to always have portable bottled water on hand. You can carry a reusable water bottle (heavy plastic or metal) and refill with water from public drinking fountains, some of which are even now filtered for taste, or have a vertical spout to make dispensing water directly into a bottle easier. \n These considerations, of course, bar natural disasters or other disturbances to the water supply system. Again, use your best judgement. After an earthquake or a tornado or the like you can check with the local authority, and they will have maps zoned out where unsafe water may be found. Many cities water municipal properties with 'greywater' (reclaimed or otherwise not-processed) water, and there will be signs stating that the water is unsafe to drink from the sprayers. This should not be a huge problem, as parks tend to have drinking water fountains if you find yourself in a desperate situation. \n In hot states such as Arizona and New Mexico, all businesses must provide tap water upon request. \n  Cope[edit]   News[edit]  News media in the U.S. is almost entirely privately-owned and profit-driven, and so conforms itself to its consumers and advertisers. The result is a wide range of information and opinion, some of it focused entirely on political ideology or special interests, with others attempting to be broad and impartial to appeal to a wide audience. As a very general rule (there are always exceptions) radio news has right-wing opinions, while print and cable news has a left-wing inclination. Other publications or channels will offer a range of right, center, and left opinions, but this is relatively uncommon. \n  Newspapers[edit]  The five most important newspapers are as follows: \n Most good newsstands (especially at major airports) always carry the NYT, the WSJ, and USA Today, as well as one or more local newspapers. In addition, they may also carry either the LA Times or the Washington Post (depending on whether they sit west or east of the Mississippi River). Local newspapers can generally be found at sidewalk vending machines in the cities they cover, together with USA Today. Starbucks Coffee shops and other coffee houses often also carry newspapers. \n  Cable News Channels[edit]   Dress[edit]  Today, dress in the US tends to be fairly casual. For everyday clothes, jeans and T-shirts are generally acceptable, as are shorts when the weather is suitable. Sneakers (athletic shoes) are common; flip-flops, tank tops, and sandals are also popular in warm weather. \n At the workplace, business casual (slacks, understated collared shirts without a tie, and non-athletic shoes) is now the default at many companies; more traditional industries (e.g. finance, legal, and insurance) still require suits and ties, while others (e.g. computer software) are even more casual, allowing jeans and even shorts. \n When dressing up for nice restaurants or upscale entertainment, a pair of nice slacks, a collared shirt, and dress shoes will work almost everywhere. Ties for men are rarely necessary, but jackets are occasionally required for very upscale restaurants in big cities. \n At the beach or pool, men prefer loose bathing trunks or boardshorts, and women wear bikinis or one-piece swimsuits. Nude bathing is allowed at certain private beaches or resorts; female toplessness is legal in most states. Many establishments, such as water parks, will enforce rules on improper swimwear; for example, insufficient covering of the intimate parts or offensive language. Staff members may ask you to either change into swimwear more appropriate or be escorted out of the park (typically without a refund). \n Generally, Americans accept religious attire such as hijab, yarmulke, and burqa without comment. However, do be aware that in places of heightened security such as banks, municipal buildings, and so on, wearing clothing which covers the face may be regarded as suspicious behavior. If you do this, use additional caution and calmly explain if confronted. \n  Respect[edit]    Burning Man, Nevada \n \n\n The number one rule of respect among Americans is that it must be earned by your actions and integrity. Being honest, polite, and open-minded will win you much more respect than your age, wealth, or level of education. \n  Communication Style[edit]  Americans in general are passionate, curious conversationalists that tend to be very open, even about issues that would normally be seen as shockingly private in many parts of the world. \n Americans are indirect in a way that seems superficial or rude in some parts of the world, especially where direct communication is the norm, and it can be difficult to know what to expect from them and what they're actually saying. Do not be perplexed by this as this is simply a part of culture. \n  Social Etiquette[edit]  Most Americans place a high value on personal hygiene. Adults are expected to wear deodorant and to brush their teeth. \n  Things to avoid[edit]   Politics:[edit]   Symbols:[edit]   Military:[edit]   Religion:[edit]   Race:[edit]   Contact[edit]   By phone[edit]  U.S. telephone numbers are governed by the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) and are invariably written in one of these formats: \n The numbers YYY-ZZZZ make up the local part of the telephone number (specifically, the telephone exchange number and line number). You must dial all seven digits even if the YYY portion is the same as the line you are calling from. The numbers XXX denote the area code. Densely populated areas often have several area codes (e.g. the six area codes within the borders of New York City), while some sparsely-populated states will have one or two codes for the entire state (e.g. Montana). \n Ordinarily, if the number you are dialing is within the same area code as the one for the line you are dialing from, dial YYY-ZZZZ; otherwise, dial 1-XXX-YYY-ZZZZ. However, many metropolitan areas, and even some entire states (such as Maryland and West Virginia) have implemented 10-digit dialing, where all local calls must be dialed as XXX-YYY-ZZZZ. (In such areas, you must still dial \"1\" to distinguish long-distance calls.) Mobile phones are much simpler and can be dialed with all 10 digits regardless of whether the call is local or long distance. \n You may occasionally see phone numbers for business which spell out words, such as \"1-800-FLOWERS\". Almost all phones have letters written on each number (\"2\" is \"ABC\", \"3\" is \"DEF\", etc.) which you use to dial the number; for example, \"FLOWERS\" becomes \"356-9377\". This is a legacy of the old alphabet letter codes which were previously used for telephone exchanges. In the case of mobile phones, most feature phones (i.e., not smartphones) have the letters printed along with the numbers. As for smartphones, most touchscreen phones have virtual phone keypads that display the corresponding letters along with the numbers. Smartphones without touchscreens, such as some older BlackBerry devices, often allow you to enter letters as part of a phone number. In either case, entering \"1-800-FLOWERS\" and pressing the send button should connect you to that business. \n Long-distance calls are calls to lines outside the \"local calling area\" of the line from which you are dialing. The long-distance prefix (in some countries called the \"trunk\" prefix) in the U.S. is \"1\", so a long-distance call should be dialed 1-XXX-YYY-ZZZZ. As with local calls, dialing incorrectly will result in an automated message informing you how to properly dial the number. Mobile phones typically do not require you to dial \"1\" for long-distance. \n Canada and certain Caribbean islands also participate in the NANP. This means they can be dialed using \"1\" as if they were in the U.S., although the call will be billed at international rates. As a general rule, calls to Canada are more expensive than U.S. domestic calls, but cheaper than calls to other countries. Calls to other locations require using the international access code (\"011\") followed by the country code of the destination number. For example, a call from the United States to the British Museum in London would be dialed as 011-44-20-7323-8000. \n At some locations with internal phone systems (e.g. businesses and hotels), you will need to dial an access code (usually \"9\" or \"8\") to reach an outside line before dialing the number as usual. \n Numbers with the area code 800, 888, 877, 866, or 855 are toll free within the U.S, meaning that the cost of the call is paid by the recipient. Outside the country, dial 880, 881, 882, and 883 respectively, but these aren't toll free. The area code 900 is used for services with additional charges applied to the call (e.g. \"adult entertainment\"). This is also true of \"local\" seven-digit phone numbers starting with 976. \n Most visitor areas and some restaurants and bars have directories with two listings of telephone numbers (often split into two books): the white pages, for an alphabetical listing; and the yellow pages, an advertising-filled listing of business and service establishments by category (e.g. \"Taxicabs\"). Directory information can also be obtained by dialing 411 (for local numbers) or 1-area code-555-1212 (for other areas). If 411 doesn't work locally, try 555-1212 or 1-555-1212. Directory information is normally an extra cost call. As an alternative, directory information is available for free via 1-800-Free411, which is ad-supported. Information directories are also available online at each regional telephone company's web site (most often AT&amp;T, Verizon, or CenturyLink; also Frontier in West Virginia and FairPoint in northern New England), as well as www.free411.com. Although each claims to have all the local phone numbers of the others, using the site of the region you are searching for yields the best results (i.e. AT&amp;T for most of California, Verizon for the Northeast, etc.) Many residential land-line phones and all mobile phones are unlisted. \n Historically, pay phones were ubiquitous on sidewalks all over the United States, and commonplace in other places such as gas stations. After 2000, cell phone usage soared and pay phone usage collapsed, so the regional landline telecom monopolies exited the pay phone business. The small companies that took over the legacy pay phones have ripped out most of them and increased prices on the ones that remain. Today, prices are typically 50 cents for the first three minutes, and a quarter for each additional minute. You will probably have to enter a store or restaurant to find one, though some are against the outer wall of such businesses, usually in front, or near bus stops. Most pay phones are coin operated (quarters, dimes and nickels) and do not accept paper bills. An online directory of pay phones can be found at Pay Phone Directory [30]. Dialing 9-1-1 to report an emergency is still a free call on pay phones, it's just a matter of locating one to use. \n Long-distance telephone calling cards are available at most convenience stores. Most calling cards have specific destinations in mind (domestic calls, calls to particular countries), so make sure you get the right card. Some cards may be refilled by phoning a number and giving your Visa/MasterCard number, but often operators refuse foreign cards for this purpose. Moreover, calls may cost more if a payphone or toll-free number is used or if a mobile number is dialed or if more calls are made (rather than few but longer calls). \n Another option is using a virtual number service.[31] That way you can avoid paying for roaming. \n  Mobile phones[edit]  American mobile phone services (known as cell phones regardless of the technology used) are not very compatible with those offered abroad. While GSM has been gaining in popularity, the US uses the unusual 1900 and 850MHz frequencies; check with your operator or mobile phone dealer to see if your phone is a tri-band or quad-band model that will work here. Roaming fees for foreign mobiles are high and text messages may not always work due to compatibility issues between networks. \n Depending on the length of your trip and the amount of calling you plan on doing, it may be less expensive to obtain an American mobile phone. If you are arriving and departing from the same city, consider that most larger airports will have a boutique that rents mobile phones (rates start around $3/day). Alternatively, prepaid phones and top-up cards can be purchased at mobile phone boutiques and at many discount, electronics, office supply and convenience stores. A very basic mobile handset and credit for an hour or two's worth of calls can be had for under $40, though be aware that international calling will, if it is in fact available, use up those credits much more quickly than a domestic call. It is possible to purchase a prepaid SIM card for an unlocked mobile, although these are not nearly as common in the United States as in other countries so you will probably have to purchase it from a GSM provider's boutique. The four major national carriers are AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile, which operate boutiques in most, if not all, metropolitan areas and offer pre-paid service. Historically, the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile networks have used GSM, while Verizon and Sprint have used the different CDMA standard (whose phones did not use SIM cards). Verizon, however, is discontinuing their CDMA network and allowing GSM only devices to use their network. Today, all four carriers are quickly migrating to the newer LTE standard (which uses SIM cards), and most Verizon and Sprint phones support LTE, CDMA, and GSM. Other providers of mobile phone service include TracFone, Boost Mobile, Simple Mobile, and various regional operators. To work out whether a regional operator might work better (as their deals are more flexible over their local areas of service) OpenSignal provide independent US coverage maps. \n Unlike in many countries, there is no surcharge for dialing a mobile phone (calls to mobile phones are charged the same as calls to land lines outside your geographic area), but on the other hand mobile phone users are charged for incoming and outgoing calls and SMS (you won't be able to contact someone who does not have sufficient balance to receive phone calls). Numbers that are toll-free from land lines, however, are not free when dialed from a mobile phone. Packages as low as $25/month are available to allow you to make hundreds of minutes worth of calls. Take note that a failed attempt at making a call (or a \"missed call\") will be deducted from your balance since you are charged from the moment you dial. \n The US has moved away from contracts and it is more common to pay your phone through an installment plan or lease the device. Most postpaid plans offer unlimited calling, SMS, and data, but limit the speed of certain content or add extra features if you pay more. With the removal of contracts, the phone can be purchased either upfront, through an interest-free installment plan for a 24 month period, or leased with certain conditions. Instead of paying a fee to leave, the remaining balance on the phone is charged. \n Conversely, if you are only going to be in the US for a short period (eg a week or less), some carriers (most notably T-Mobile) offer a plan that allows unlimited calling, texting, and data for $2-3 per day. This will not include international calling, however. \n  By mail[edit]   Overview[edit]   A USPS Self-Service Kiosk at a post office.\n \n\n Each post office has different hours, but most are open 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Saturday. In high crime areas, post offices are completely closed to the public when not open. In low crime areas, the lobby is divided into two areas. The retail counter area is closed after hours, but the rest of the lobby can be open 24/7 (or may only be open longer hours like 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and normally includes access to Post Office Boxes as well as at least one Self-Service Kiosk (SSK). The SSK is an easy-to-use self-service touchscreen kiosk that accepts credit cards. It can weigh packages and print out a variety of different types of postage and labels. \n  Addressing[edit]  In general, the addressee's section of the piece of mail should appear as follows: \n (name of recipient) \n (street address, which contains the house number and street name) \n (apartment, suite or room number if any)\n (city or town), (two digit state abbreviation) (ZIP code)\n\n For example:\n John &amp; Jane Doe \n 555 Main St\n Apt #1\n Houston, TX 77002-0001\n\n To send items to any destination within the U.S. by post, the most important item in the addressee's section of the mailpiece is the ZIP code (postal code). \n The importance of the ZIP code arises from the Postal Service's highly automated process for handling mail. USPS personnel dump all newly received mailpieces into a scanning machine that runs optical character recognition on the destination address and then sprays or prints a Intelligent Mail Barcode corresponding to the ZIP+4 code. The Intelligent Mail Barcode is then scanned by high-speed automatic sorting machines at each step in the system, in order to route the mailpiece into the bag or tray of the letter carrier whose route includes that ZIP+4 code. Thus, if the ZIP+4 code and Intelligent Mail Barcode are incorrect, the error will not be detected until the mailpiece gets to the wrong letter carrier. The USPS requires a particular combination of house number and street name to be unique within the same city, but does not require a street name to be unique across an entire metropolitan area. Since there are often many cities in a single metropolitan area that have streets with the same name, writing the correct ZIP code is essential to prompt delivery of your mailpiece. \n When you do not know of or are unsure of the correct ZIP code, visit USPS.com, the website of the USPS. It enables users to look up ZIP codes by city and by street address. Entering a full street address may return a ZIP code (first 5 digits) and ZIP+4 (next 4 digits) to a total of 9 digits. The ZIP (first 5 digits) usually encompasses a greater area such as a section of a city, an entire town or across an expansive (rural) area encompassing several small towns. University campuses, large hospitals, governmental agencies, military bases, sections of the U.S. military or a single large building may have their own unique ZIP code and any mail sent to that particular ZIP code goes to that institution's internal mail room for onward delivery. Depending upon the complexity of a particular place, the unique ZIP+4 code (next for 4 digits) may correspond to anything from a segment along a letter carrier's route to the entire route (which may cover an entire small town); a group of apartments, offices or storefronts in a single address; an office within a specific building (which is often the case in big cities); or a department, office, mail stop or a building on an university campus or some large entity with its own unique zip code. \n The \"+4\" portion of the ZIP code is optional. For nearly all addresses, as long as the written address in its entirety corresponds to an actual and unique address, the OCR machine will be able to link it to that address, quickly identify the correct \"+4\" portion, and print the correct Intelligent Mail Barcode. But the ZIP code (the first 5 digits) is always necessary. In some areas, the same ZIP code may be used for multiple towns (for example, 19401 applies to Norristown and East Norriton, Pennsylvania), but a street name may occur multiple times in the ZIP code (there are two Montgomery Avenues in 19401, one in Norristown, the other in East Norriton), so be sure to use the correct town and use the ZIP+4, if possible. \n  Pricing[edit]  First class (airmail) postcards and letters (if not oversized, or over one ounce/28.5 grams) are $1.15 internationally including to Canada and Mexico. It is no longer necessary to mark \"AIR MAIL\" on items going overseas as everything is now sent abroad on airplane by default. All addresses with a USPS ZIP code are considered \"domestic\", including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Palau, U.S. military bases abroad (identified with an 'APO' or 'FPO' address)[33], U.S. Navy ships at sea (usually 'FPO' addresses) [34] and U.S. diplomatic missions abroad ('DPO' addresses). Domestic postcards are sent for $0.35 (Jan. 2018) while a letter in an envelope weighing within 1 oz is mailed for $0.50 (Jan. 2018). If you put a solid object like a coin or a key in an envelope, you'll pay a surcharge. [35]\n \"Forever\" stamps are always valid for the first ounce for all first-class domestic mail items, with no surcharge after a price increase. (For all other kinds of price increases and historically for first-class domestic mail price increases, the USPS sells one and two-cent stamps which must be added to cover the difference between the face value of stamps sold before an increase and the current rate.) However, Forever stamps are not valid for international use. \n If for whatever reason you have stamps that don't add up to the correct exact amount, you can try overpaying by adding one more stamp. The USPS stamp canceling machines are intelligent enough to recognize that fact and allow the mail piece through. \n Due to sagging demand, the USPS has taken away the vending machines through which one could formerly purchase a variety of pre-printed stamp booklets in post office lobbies. The SSKs as initially deployed could regularly dispense at least one type of pre-printed stamp booklet year-round, but that feature has been withdrawn as well. The USPS will still make stamp booklets available sometimes through the SSKs, but only on an intermittent and seasonal basis. \n Therefore, at this time, the only always-available method for buying postage at a post office when the retail counter is closed is to use the SSK in the lobby to print bar-coded postage labels. However, besides post office retail counters, stamp booklets are also available from many retailers, including pharmacies, supermarkets, and certain banks. \n  Receiving mail via General Delivery[edit]  You can receive mail sent both domestically and from abroad by having it addressed to you as \"General Delivery.\" In other countries, this is often called Poste Restante. There is no charge for this service. You just go to the main post office, wait in line, and they will give you your mail after showing ID such as a passport. \n John Doe \n General Delivery \nSeattle, Washington 98101-9999 \n U.S.A. \n\n The last four digits of the ZIP (postal) Code for General Delivery is always '9999'. If the city is large enough to have multiple post offices, only one (usually in the center of downtown) will have the General Delivery service. This means, for example, if you're staying in the Green Lake district of Seattle (a few miles north of downtown), you cannot receive your mail at the Green Lake Post Office, and must travel downtown to get it. On the other hand, if you're completely outside of the city of Seattle, and in a smaller town with only one post office, you can have it sent there. \n The two largest private courier services, UPS and FedEx, also have a \"Hold for Pickup\" option. Both can hold a package at the nearest depot, while FedEx can also hold packages at FedEx Office locations. \n  By Internet[edit]  Most Americans have Internet access, mostly in their homes and offices. Internet cafes, therefore, are not common outside of major metropolitan, tourist and resort areas. However, you almost always have several options for Internet access, except perhaps in the most remote, rural areas. \n If you bring your own computer or tablet: \n  \n NOTE: An increasingly common method of identity theft is thieves turning on their computer or cell phone's \"mobile hotspot\" function in a public area with the expectation that someone will connect to it. This scheme sets up a WiFi network—without a password and sometimes with a deceiving name— using their laptop/phone as a router to their laptop/phone's Internet connection, allowing them to record all information that passes through the connection or even (if they have expert computer skills) gain access to your computer's hard drive. Your best bet is to go into the business to find out what their WiFi network is named and always select \"public network\" if your computer prompts you while connecting (this prevents others on the network from 'seeing' your device and preventing any other device on the network from accessing your device). Make sure your computer has good antivirus protection and a good third-party (not just Windows) firewall as a safety precaution against unauthorized access to your device. Always keep in mind that a public network may have a filter to prevent access to certain sites and some (like libraries) may even monitor your Internet usage. \n \n \n\n  \n NOTE: Some public Internet terminals track users' activities and nearly all of them are connected to a filtered Internet connection. A filtered Internet connection will restrict you from accessing certain sites, such as those with adult content or with security issues. It is best to only use a public computer for basic tasks, such as e-mail and social networking. To ensure your security, do not perform any sensitive tasks, such as online banking, on a public computer unless absolutely necessary. If you are in doubt, bring your own laptop and use a WiFi hotspot instead, as these are generally slightly more secure. \n  \n \n\n If you don't have your own computer: \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  This country guide is usable.

For other uses, see Usa (disambiguation).\n The United States of America is a vast country in North America. It borders on Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, and has a land area of about 9.6 million km2 (about half the size of Russia and about the same size as China). It also has the world's third-largest population, with more than 320 million people. It includes densely populated cities with sprawling suburbs and vast uninhabited areas of natural beauty. Representing the world's single largest economy with its history of mass immigration dating from the 17th century, it is a \"melting pot\" of cultures from around the world. \n Regarded as the most powerful and influential country in the world, it plays a dominant role in the world's cultural landscape, and is famous for its wide array of popular tourist destinations, ranging from the skyscrapers of Manhattan and Chicago, to the natural wonders of Yellowstone and Alaska, to the canyonlands of the Southwest, to the warm, sunny beaches of Florida, Hawaii and Southern California. \n  Regions[edit]  The United States comprises 50 states and the nation's capital city of Washington, D.C., which for the purposes of Wikivoyage are grouped into the following regions: \n   Map of the United States\n \n\n   New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont)\nHome to gabled churches, rustic antiques, and steeped in American history, New England offers beaches, spectacular seafood, rugged mountains, frequent winter snows, and some of the nation's oldest cities, in a territory small enough to tour (hastily) in a week.      Mid-Atlantic (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.)\nRanging from New York to Washington, D.C., the Mid-Atlantic is home to some of the nation's most densely populated cities, historic sites, rolling mountains and seaside resorts.      South (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia)\nThe South is celebrated for its hospitality, down-home cooking, and its blues, jazz, rock 'n' roll, bluegrass and country music traditions. This lush, largely subtropical region includes cool, verdant mountains, plantations, and vast cypress swamps.      Florida\nNorthern Florida is similar to the rest of the South, but this is not so in the resorts of Orlando, retirement communities, tropical Caribbean-influenced Miami, the Everglades, and 1,200 mi (1,900 km) of sandy beaches.      Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin)\nA region of simple and hospitable people, farmland, forests, picturesque towns, industrial cities and the Great Lakes — the largest system of freshwater lakes in the world, which forms the North Coast of the U.S.      Texas\nThe second biggest state is like a separate country (and indeed once was), with strong cultural influences from its Spanish and Mexican past. The terrain is quite varied, with swamplands in the southeast, flat land and cotton farms in the South Plains, sandy beaches in South Texas and mountains and deserts in far West Texas.      Great Plains (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma)\nA former Wild West frontier land often described as \"flatter than a pancake,\" this region used to consist of endless grasslands. Much of it is now one huge farm after another, with occasional towns, but the remaining prairies are still vast and somewhat desolate.      Rocky Mountains (Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming)\nThe spectacular snow-covered Rockies offer hiking, rafting, excellent skiing, deserts, and some large cities.      Southwest (Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah)\nHeavily influenced by Spanish, Mexican and Native American cultures, this area is home to some of the nation's most spectacular natural attractions and flourishing artistic communities. Although mostly empty, the region's deserts contain some big cities.      California\nLike the Southwest, California is heavily influenced by its former Spanish and Mexican rulers, and also by Asian culture and cuisine. California offers world-famous cities, deserts, rainforests, snowy mountains, and beautiful beaches.      Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon)\nThe pleasantly mild Pacific Northwest offers outdoor pursuits and cosmopolitan cities. The terrain features spectacular rainforests, scenic mountains and volcanoes, beautiful coastlines and sage-covered steppes and deserts.      Alaska\nOne fifth as large as the rest of the United States, Alaska reaches well into the Arctic, and features mountainous wilderness, including North America's tallest mountain, Denali, and Native Alaskan culture unseen elsewhere in the United States.      Hawaii\nA volcanic archipelago in the tropical Pacific, 2,300 mi (3,700 km) southwest of California (the nearest state), laid-back Hawaii is a vacation paradise.   \n The U.S. also administers a collection of non-state territories around the world, principally in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Oceania (Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and various uninhabited islands and island groups). As these are quite different from the 50 states from a traveler's point of view, they are covered in separate articles. \n  Cities[edit]   White House south façade, Washington, D.C.\n \n\n The United States has over 10,000 cities, towns, and villages. The following is a list of nine of the most notable. Other cities can be found in their corresponding regions. \n  Other destinations[edit]   The Grand Canyon in Arizona \n \n\n These are some of the largest and most famous destinations outside of major cities. \n  Understand[edit]     Capital Washington, D.C.

It is large, complex, and diverse, with distinct regional identities. Due to the distances involved, travelling between regions can be time-consuming and expensive. \n  Geography[edit]    Appalachians in Georgia \n \n\n The contiguous United States or \"Lower 48\" refers to the territory excluding Alaska and Hawaii. Much of the population lives on the Atlantic, Pacific or Gulf of Mexico coasts or along the Great Lakes. Its only land borders — both quite long — are shared with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The continental United States are the 48 contiguous states, D.C. and Alaska, but exclude Hawaii. \n   Grand Tetons, Rocky Mountains, Wyoming \n \n\n The country has three major mountain ranges. The Appalachians extend from Canada to Alabama, a few hundred miles west of the Atlantic Ocean. They are the oldest of the three ranges and offer spectacular sightseeing and excellent camping spots. The Rockies are, on average, the highest in North America, extending from Alaska to New Mexico, with many areas designated as national parks that offer hiking, camping, skiing, and sightseeing opportunities. The combined Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges are the youngest. The Sierras extend across the \"backbone\" of California, with sites such as Lake Tahoe and Yosemite National Park, then give way to the even younger volcanic Cascade range, with some of the highest points in the country. \n In the center of the country is the Great Plains, which includes the entirety of Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and portions of the surrounding states. This region is characterized by long stretches of flat land, and areas of gentle rolling hills. It consists largely of farmland and prairie. \n The Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast of Texas, to the south of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida's Panhandle, and constitutes the West Coast of Florida. \n The Great Lakes define much of the border between the eastern United States and Canada. More fresh water inland seas than lakes, they were formed by the pressure of retreating glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age. The five lakes span hundreds of miles, bordering the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, and their shores vary from pristine wilderness areas to industrial \"rust belt\" cities. \n  Climate[edit]  Although much of the U.S. has a temperate climate, there is also a wide variety from Arctic tundra in Alaska to the tropical weather in Hawaii and South Florida. The Great Plains are dry, flat and grassy, turning into desert in the far West and Mediterranean along the California coast. \n In the winter, major cities in the North and Midwest can see as much as 2 feet (61 cm) of snowfall in one day, with cold temperatures. Summers are humid, but mild. Temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C) sometimes invade the Midwest and Great Plains. Some areas in the northern plains can experience cold temperatures of −30 °F (−34 °C) during the winter. Temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) sometimes reach as far south as Oklahoma. \n The climate of the South also varies. In the summer, it is hot and humid, but from October through April the weather can range from 60 °F (16 °C) to short cold spells of 20 °F (−7 °C) or so. \n The Great Plains and Midwestern states also experience tornadoes from the late spring to early fall, earlier in the south and later in the north. States along the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico may experience hurricanes between June and November. These intense and dangerous storms frequently miss the U.S. mainland, but evacuations are often ordered and should be heeded. \n The Rockies are cold and snowy. Some parts of the Rockies see over 500 inches (1,300 cm) of snow in a season. Even during the summer, temperatures are cool in the mountains, and snow can fall nearly year-round. It is dangerous to go up in the mountains unprepared in the winter and the roads through them can get very icy. \n The deserts of the Southwest are hot and dry during the summer, with temperatures often exceeding 100 °F (38 °C). Thunderstorms can be expected in the southwest frequently from July through September. Winters are mild, and snow is unusual. Average annual precipitation is low, usually less than 10 in (250 mm). \n Cool and damp weather is common much of the year in the coastal northwest (Oregon and Washington west of the Cascade Range, and the northern part of California west of the Coast Ranges/Cascades). Summers (July through September) are usually quite dry with low humidity, though, making it the ideal climate for outdoor activities. Rain is most frequent in winter, snow is rare, especially along the coast, and extreme temperatures are uncommon. Rain falls almost exclusively from late fall through early spring along the coast. East of the Cascades, the northwest is considerably drier. Much of the inland northwest is either semi-arid or desert, especially in Oregon. \n Northeastern and Upper Southern cities are known for summers with temperatures reaching into the 90s °F (32 °C) or more, with extremely high humidity, usually over 80%. This can be a drastic change from the Southwest. High humidity means that the temperature can feel hotter than actual readings. The Northeast also experiences snow, and at least once every few years there will be a dumping of the white stuff in enormous quantities. \n  History[edit]  United States historical travel topics:\nIndigenous nations → Pre-Civil War → Civil War → Old West → Industrialization → Postwar  Native Americans, or American Indians, arrived 13,500 to 16,000 years ago from migrating northeast Asian peoples crossing the Bering Strait into Alaska, and represented a wide variety of sophisticated societies that existed before the first arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century. The Mississippian cultures built huge settlements across the Southeast, and the Anasazi built elaborate cliff-side towns in the Southwest. These societies were decimated by Old-World diseases such as smallpox and were pushed west by warfare and encroaching European settlers. Their diminished numbers led to further marginalization, although today their cultures endure and continue to contribute to the American experience. \n European colonization began in the 16th and 17th centuries. England, Spain, and France gained large holdings; the Netherlands, Sweden, and Russia also established outposts. The first English colonies, founded in Jamestown, Virginia (1607) and Plymouth, Massachusetts (1620), formed the kernel of what is now known as the United States. \n In the North, Massachusetts was settled by religious immigrants — Puritans — who later spread and founded most of the other New England colonies, creating a highly religious and idealistic region. Other religious groups also founded colonies, including the Quakers in Pennsylvania and Roman Catholics in Maryland. The Middle Colonies of New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania became the North's cosmopolitan center. \n Longer growing seasons in the Southern colonies, which remained dominated by Virginia, gave them richer agricultural prospects, especially for cotton and tobacco. As in Latin America and the Caribbean, indentured servants, convicts and later African slaves were imported and forced to cultivate large plantations. Slavery was practiced in both North and South, but its greater importance to the South's economy eventually caused tremendous upheaval. \n  Independence Hall in Philadelphia was where the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were drafted\n \n\n By the early 18th century, Great Britain had colonized the Atlantic coast from Georgia north into what is now Canada. The last major British migration to the territory that would become the United States took place in middle decades of that century when the Appalachia region was settled. In 1763, British dominance in North America was established after the global Seven Years' War. In part to finance the North American campaigns of the war, known as the French and Indian War, Britain imposed unpopular taxes and regulations on its colonists. This precipitated revolution in 1775 and on 4 July 1776, colonists from 13 colonies declared independence. The Revolutionary War lasted until 1783, when the new United States of America gained sovereignty over all British land between the Atlantic and the Mississippi River. Those still loyal to the British mostly fled north to what is today Canada, which continued to remain under British rule. \n Wrangling over the formation of a national government lasted until 1787 when a constitution was agreed upon. Its Enlightenment-era ideas about individual liberty have since inspired the founding decrees of many states. George Washington, the general-in-chief of the revolutionary army, was elected the first president. By the turn of the 19th century, the newly-built Washington, D.C. was established as the national capital. \n New states were created as white settlers moved west beyond the Appalachian Mountains. The Native American populations were displaced and further harrowed by war and disease. The 1803 Louisiana Purchase of French lands to the west of the Mississippi (charted by the Lewis and Clark expedition) effectively doubled the size of the nation, and provided \"Indian Territory\" in what is now Oklahoma for the many Native American tribes from the east that were forcibly relocated during the Trail of Tears of the 1830s. \n Further disagreements with British commerce policies arising from the Napoleonic Wars and Royal Navy impressment led to the War of 1812. There were over two years of dramatic action on land and sea that included an attempted invasion of Canada and the burning of the White House and public buildings in Washington, D.C. The final stalemate saw virtually no changes of territory, but the war galvanized separate American and Canadian identities. The national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", was conceived during this war. Western Native American tribes that had sided with the British suffered greatly as their territory was given to white settlers. \n After the war, industry and infrastructure were expanded greatly, particularly in the Northeast; see American Industry Tour. Roads and canals came first and helped people spread inland. In 1825, the Erie Canal connected the Atlantic to the Great Lakes. By the late 1860s, railroads and telegraph lines connected the east and west coasts via the industrial hub of Chicago in the Midwest. In the early 19th century, a series of religious revivals, the Second Great Awakening, led to various reform movements that strove for goals such as temperance, the abolition of slavery, and women's suffrage. \n  The 1836 Battle of the Alamo (San Antonio, Texas) was a crucial moment of the Texas Revolution.\n \n\n U.S. expansion south and west chipped away at Spanish and Mexican territory. Spain sold Florida in 1813 after American military intervention, and an 1836 rebellion by American settlers in Mexican Texas founded an independent republic which was absorbed into the Union ten years later. This sparked the Mexican–American War in which Mexico lost what is now California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, and the contiguous United States essentially assumed its modern outline. Native Americans were relegated to reservations and continued to be purged by treaty, military force, and disease from settlers on the Oregon Trail and other westward routes. (See also \"Old West\".) \n Federal governance was light and the states were highly autonomous. By the 1850s, there was irreconcilable disparity between the industrialized and more urban Northern states, which had all outlawed slavery within three decades of the revolution, and the plantation-dependent rural South. Many in the North wanted to impose a national ban on the expansion of slavery, while the Southern states sought to expand slavery into new territories. Abolitionists operated an Underground Railroad leading fugitive slaves in the northern states to freedom in Canada. In 1861, eleven Southern states, fearful of marginalization and the avowedly anti-slavery President Abraham Lincoln, broke from the Union and formed an independent Confederate States of America. The ensuing American Civil War remains the bloodiest conflict on American soil and killed hundreds of thousands of people. In 1865, Union forces prevailed, firmly cementing the federal government's authority over the states. Slavery was abolished nationwide and the Confederate states were re-admitted into the Union during a period of Reconstruction. The former slaves and their descendants were to remain an economic and social underclass, particularly in the South. \n Russia sold its tenuously held Alaskan territory in 1867, and independent Hawaii was annexed in 1898. The United States' decisive victory over Spain in the 1898 Spanish–American War gained it colonial territories: Cuba (granted independence a few years later), the Philippines (granted independence shortly after World War II), Puerto Rico and Guam (which remain American dependencies). The boundaries of the United States took the form we know today in 1959, when the territories of Alaska and Hawaii were granted statehood. \n In the late 19th and into the 20th century, Southern and Eastern Europeans, Russian Jews and Irish bolstered the continuing industrialization of the eastern cities by providing cheap labor. Many Southern African-Americans fled rural poverty and racism for industrial jobs in the North. Other immigrants, including many Scandinavians and Germans, moved to newly opened territories in the West and Midwest, where land was given to anyone who would develop it. \n The United States' entrance into World War I in 1917 marked the start of an era in which it would become a world power. However, soon after the victory the U.S. eschewed international involvement and refused to join the nascent League of Nations, effectively crippling the organization. Real wealth grew rapidly and in the Roaring 20s stock speculation created an immense financial \"bubble\". It burst in 1929, leading to the global economic havoc of the Great Depression. The resulting privation fostered a culture of sacrifice and hard work that would serve the country well in the coming conflict. It also ushered in President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His \"New Deal\" was a series of government programs that constructed thousands of buildings and bridges across the country while creating the basis of the American welfare state. \n  The USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor \n \n\n In 1941 Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, a Hawaiian naval base, plunging the United States into World War II on the side of the Allied Powers - see World War II in Europe and the Pacific War. The U.S. developed atomic bombs and dropped them twice on Japan in 1945, abruptly ending the war. By the end of the war, the United States had firmly established itself as the world's dominant economic power, responsible for nearly half of global industrial production. During the ensuing Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union jostled for power while courting their own mutually assured destruction with nuclear weapons. Although war between the two superpowers never occurred, both sides were indirectly involved in covert operations and military endeavors through various proxy states that continue to (often negatively) affect the view people have of the United States and its role in global politics. \n For the century after the Civil War, black people, though ostensibly equal citizens under the post–Civil War amendments to the U.S. Constitution, suffered through strong social, economic, and political discrimination and state-sanctioned segregation, especially in the South. A movement fighting for full civil rights for black Americans gained strength following World War II, when returning black veterans who fought against racism abroad came home to find they were still heavily discriminated against. The civil rights movement vehemently, but largely peacefully, vied for equal rights. With Martin Luther King, Jr., a charismatic preacher, as its most visible leader, the movement came to a head in 1963 when 200,000–300,000 people flooded the capital to listen to him. The landmark Civil Rights Act that was passed in 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, although such discrimination does still exist, mostly in less blatant forms. It would not be until the election of Barack Obama 44 years later in 2008 that the country would have its first African-American president. A revived women's movement in the 1960s also led to wide-ranging changes in American society. \n Postwar America was characterized by affluence and industrialization. People left agriculture and moved to the cities to become part of an increasingly technology-based economy. American car culture emerged in the 1950s and was supported by the construction of a comprehensive Interstate Highway System. These trends also led to the rise of suburbia and a decline in public transportation and rail travel, making touring the United States without a car particularly difficult to this day. They also resulted in white flight to the suburbs in many American cities, leaving many black people behind in blighted inner city neighborhoods. The American consumer culture, Hollywood movies and many forms of popular music established the United States as a cultural superpower in the world. The U.S. grew into one of the world's major centers of higher education, and is now home to many of the world's most prestigious universities, attracting more international students than any other country. \n Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States has emerged as the world's sole superpower, and while its hegemony is increasingly being challenged by a resurgent China and Russia, it continues to play the dominant military, economic, political, and cultural role in world affairs. Hopes that after the fall of America's chief rival, expensive and sometimes disastrous wars (such as the Vietnam War) were a thing of the past sadly haven't proven true. Recent administrations have all had to deal in one form or other with what they call the threat of \"rogue states\", terrorism, and a rapidly changing global political landscape. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, are still very much an open wound and influence the political debate to this day, with heightened security measures at airports being just one way in which terrorism (or the fear of it) has affected travelers. Economically, the \"Great Recession\", triggered in 2007 by the collapse of the housing market bubble, came to an end in 2009, but the average American continues to feel the negative effects several years on. \n  Government and politics[edit]  The United States is a federal republic. Its major constituents are the 50 states and the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.); it also has various island territories in the Caribbean and Pacific that are strongly—but often not fully—integrated into the union. \n The federal government derives its power from the U.S. Constitution, which is the oldest written constitution in continuous use. Within the overarching federal laws, each state maintains its own constitution, government and laws, and so retains considerable autonomy within the federation. State laws can vary in their details but are, for the most part, fairly uniform from state to state. \n The President is elected every four years and is the head of the federal government and head of state. He and his administration form the executive branch. The bicameral Congress (comprising the lower House of Representatives and the upper Senate) is also popularly elected, and constitutes the legislative branch. The Supreme Court tops the judicial branch. State governments are organized similarly, with governors, legislatures, and judiciaries. \n Two major political parties have dominated at state and federal levels since the end of the Civil War: the Republican Party (often referred to as the GOP, short for \"Grand Old Party\") and the Democratic Party. Since the 1960s the Republican Party has become generally the more right-wing or \"conservative\" party whereas the Democratic Party is usually the more left-wing or \"liberal\" of the two parties. While smaller political parties exist, the winner-take-all electoral system means that they rarely succeed at any level. Although in much of the world red and blue indicate left- and right-leaning parties respectively, they are reversed in the U.S so that Republicans are red and Democrats are blue. \n  Culture[edit]   The South's famous Bourbon Street, New Orleans, Louisiana \n \n\n The United States is made up of many diverse ethnic groups and the culture varies greatly across the vast area of the country and even within cities – a city like New York will have dozens, if not hundreds, of different ethnicities represented within a neighborhood. Despite this difference, there exists a strong sense of national identity and certain predominant cultural traits. Generally, Americans tend to believe strongly in personal freedom and responsibility, and that an individual determines his or her own success or failure, but there are many exceptions. You will find Mississippi in the South to be very different culturally from Massachusetts in the North. \n Religion is very important in the United States with 80% of people identifying with having a religious affiliation. Current estimates are that 49% of Americans belong to a Christian Protestant church and another 23% are Roman Catholic. 5% of Americans belong to non-Christian religions such as Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism. Many businesses and institutions are closed on Sundays, and a number of areas in the South and Midwest forbid certain activities to take place on Sundays, while some Jewish businesses close on Friday nights and Saturdays for the Sabbath. \n Although officially a secular state, the United States is in practice more religious than other Western countries such as Australia, Canada and most European countries. However, this trend varies greatly by region, with the West Coast and Northeast being largely secular and the American South being heavily Evangelical Christian. Differences in religiosity often correlate with politics, so the Northeast, West Coast, Hawaii and Chicago metropolitan area are generally progressive and Democratic; most of the South and heavily Mormon states like Utah, Idaho and Wyoming are very conservative and Republican; and much of the rest of the country (e.g., several Midwestern, Southwestern/Rocky Mountain, and Southern coastal states) is nearly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. However, even this can be misleading, as many conservative states have college towns and major cities that are very liberal, while liberal states often have rural areas that are very conservative. A trend of the last few decades is one of increasing geographic political polarization. Most Americans now live in counties where their political inclination has a majority of 20% or greater and cities are - on the whole - becoming more and more liberal while rural areas are becoming more and more conservative with the middle ground disappearing. \n  Holidays[edit]   Always gotta be different\n Whereas most countries celebrate Labor Day on May 1 to commemorate the Haymarket affair of 1886, the U.S. chose to celebrate it in September, due to fear that a May celebration would encourage similar Haymarket-style protests and energize the radical left. \n November 11, which is Remembrance Day in Europe and Canada, has been expanded to celebrate all veterans of the U.S. armed forces; Memorial Day serves the purpose of recognizing war dead. \n  There are no nationwide, mandatory public holidays. Federal holidays are the most centrally coordinated holidays, but they are only mandatory for the federal government and banks. All federal government offices, post offices and banks close on federal holidays, but private businesses may freely choose whether or not to observe them. \n Nearly all states and localities observe the federal holidays; most also observe an additional handful of their own. If a federal holiday falls on a weekend, the observance will be shifted to the nearest weekday (either Friday or Monday), with closures similar to Presidents Day in February. The festivities and major retail closings will occur on the annual date, even if it's the weekend. \n The time between Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday in November) and January 1 has such a high concentration of major holidays that it is often simply called \"the holiday season.\" School and work vacations are commonly taken during this period, with people visiting family and friends. Airports, Interstates, bus stations, and train stations will be very crowded near the major holidays. If you must travel, allow extra time to check in and clear security. This is also a major gift-giving season: most shopping malls and department stores will be crowded, especially on the day after Thanksgiving, the week before Christmas, and the day after Christmas. \n As in most other countries where alcohol is legal, be careful on the roads at and around major holidays, such as New Year's, Memorial Day, or Independence Day, as there are higher concentrations of drunk drivers on the roads then. \n In the list below, federal holidays are listed in bold italics. In addition to federal holidays, the following list includes holidays that may inconvenience travelers, and nationwide celebrations of other events that may be of interest to travellers: \n  4th of July fireworks in Washington D.C.\n \n\n All U.S. embassies are closed on the federal holidays in addition to the holidays of the host country. \n  Units of measure[edit]  See also: Metric and Imperial equivalents The United States is the only industrialized country that eschews the metric system. Instead it uses \"customary units\" (feet, miles, gallons, pounds, etc.), which are largely derived from the English units of the 18th century, and are sometimes different from the imperial units that occasionally linger in Britain. Road distances are given in miles and speed limits in miles per hour (1 mile is 1.61 km, or 1 km is 0.62 miles). One of the more confusing things is that an \"ounce\" can be either a measure of weight or (as a \"fluid ounce\") a measure of volume. The U.S. fluid ounce is also slightly larger than its imperial counterpart, while U.S. gallons, quarts and pints are smaller than their counterparts. Gasoline and other liquids are usually sold per gallon, quart, or fluid ounce (a U.S. gallon is 3.78 liters, so a U.S. quart [a quarter gallon] is slightly less than a liter). Beverages such as soda are sometimes sold by the liter and other times sold by the fluid ounce, with just under 34 ounces to a liter. Temperatures are usually reported in Fahrenheit only; 32° is actually freezing, not warm! Most cars' speedometers show both miles and kilometers per hour (good for trips to Canada and Mexico), and almost all packaged foods and other products are labeled in both systems. Outside of science, medicine and the military, there is little day-to-day exposure to the metric system, so Americans will assume you understand the U.S. customary measures. \n There is no formal regulation of clothes or shoe sizes, and the only thing you can count on is that sizes tend to be consistent within the same brand. For shoe sizes some trial and error will be needed for each model. \n  Time zones[edit]   Time zones of the U.S. as of 2007; nowadays, some Indiana counties have moved to Eastern time\n \n\n Taking into consideration even the small territories in the Pacific Ocean (some of which cannot be easily accessed) the U.S. spans eleven time zones. Just four time zones are used in the contiguous 48 states, with an additional two covering Alaska and Hawaii. Time zone borders do not always correspond to state borders. \n Most parts of the U.S. observe Daylight Saving Time; Hawaii and Arizona (except the Navajo Nation) do not. \n  Talk[edit]   \"Two countries divided by a common language\"\n Speakers of British English will find many terms which differ in American English. Here are a few: \n See the article English language varieties for more words that differ across both versions. \n  Almost all Americans speak English. Most Americans speak in accents that are recognizably similar to one another and to one traditionally associated with the Midwest, which was popularized in the 20th century by American radio, TV and movies. Although many Americans can discern differences between quite a few accents, the ones most likely to be heard as distinctive by foreign visitors include those commonly spoken in the South and Texas, the Boston area, the New York City area, the upper Midwest and Hawaii. \n American English differs somewhat from the English spoken in other parts of the English speaking world. These differences are mostly minor, and primarily around minor spelling and pronunciation differences. One important difference, though, is that dates are always written MM/DD/YYYY or MM/DD. See the article on English language varieties for a detailed discussion. \n Many African-Americans and some other Americans also speak African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), which has somewhat different grammar and vocabulary from styles of American English usually regarded as standard. Nearly all African-Americans can switch back and forth between AAVE and standard American English effortlessly. Generally, if you are not African-American, you should not try to speak AAVE, even if it's spoken to you; it would be considered odd and possibly offensive. Spanglish — an admixture of Spanish and English — is similarly commonplace in many areas with large Hispanic populations, and code-switching between Spanglish and standard American English is similarly commonplace. \n Visitors are generally expected to speak and understand English. While many Americans study a foreign language in school (overwhelmingly Spanish followed by French), few progress past the basics. Popular tourist sites often have signs and information available in other languages. Americans have a long history of immigration and are very accommodating towards foreign accents, and will sometimes take the effort to help you by speaking in a more standard accent. \n Spanish is the first language of Puerto Rico and a large minority of residents on the mainland (with the fifth-largest Spanish speaking population in the world). Spanish speakers in the United States are often Puerto Ricans or first- and second-generation immigrants from Latin America. As a result, the Spanish spoken is almost invariably a Latin American dialect. Spanish is the primary second language in many parts of the United States such as California, the Southwest, Texas, Florida, and the metropolitan areas of Chicago and New York City. Many of these areas have Spanish-language radio and television stations, with local, national and Mexican programs. Most publications from the federal government, and those of some state and municipal governments are available in Spanish. Many establishments and government offices in major commercial and tourist areas have Spanish-speaking staff on duty, and it is possible with some difficulty to get by in the major cities and main tourist attractions speaking only Spanish. \n You may encounter other languages in some regions, like Hawaiian, French, American Indian languages, Yiddish, and Pennsylvania Dutch. These are covered in regional articles. \n American Sign Language (ASL) is the dominant sign language in the United States. When events are interpreted, they will be interpreted in ASL. Users of French Sign Language and other related languages may find ASL intelligible, as they share much vocabulary, but users of Japanese Sign Language, British Sign Language, or Auslan will not. Closed-captioning on television is widespread, but far from ubiquitous. Many theaters offer FM loops or other assistive listening devices, but captioning and interpreters are rarer. \n For the blind, many signs and displays include Braille transcriptions of the printed English. Larger restaurant chains, museums, and parks may offer Braille menus and guidebooks, but you'll likely have to ask for them. \n  Get in[edit]  The United States has exceptionally onerous and complicated visa requirements. Read up carefully before your visit, especially if you need to apply for a visa, and consult the Bureau of Consular Affairs. Travellers have been refused entry for many reasons, often trivial. Since 2019, visitors to the US have also been required to fully document mobile phone numbers, e-mail addresses and on-line identities they've used in the past five years, during the application process. \n    Visa restrictions:An executive order has been signed banning immigration clearance and the issuance of visas for citizens of Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, North Korea and Venezuela. Depending on the country, there might be exemptions for people in specific visa classes, though you should still expect extra scrutiny from immigration even if one of the exemptions applies to you. See Avoiding travel through the United States if you would like to look for alternative routes to non-U.S. destinations. If you are from one of the affected countries and in the U.S. on a long-term visa (e.g. work, student or immigrant visa), you are strongly advised to avoid leaving the U.S. for now, as the details of the order have changed repeatedly and you could be prevented from returning to the U.S. after your trip.\n  \n  Planning and pre-arrival documentation[edit]   Visa-free entry[edit]   Welcome!\n \n\n Citizens of the 38 countries within the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), as well as Canadians and Bermudians do not require visas for entry into the United States. Canadians and Bermudians are normally allowed to visit for up to six months. Permanent residents of Canada are not eligible for visa-free entry, unless they are also citizens of a country that participates in the Visa Waiver Program, or one of the separate provisions for a few other countries. \n The Visa Waiver Program permits visa-free stays of up to 90 days; it applies to citizens of Andorra, Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brunei, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan (must include ID card number), and the United Kingdom (must have right of abode in the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man). \n Citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau may enter, reside, study, and work in the U.S. indefinitely with only a valid passport. \n Citizens of the Bahamas may apply for visa-free entry only at the U.S. Customs pre-clearance facilities in the Bahamas, but a valid police certificate that was issued within the last six months is required for those over the age of 14. Attempting to enter through any other port of entry requires a valid visa. \n Citizens of the Turks and Caicos Islands may enter the U.S. without a visa only if they are travelling on a direct flight from there, but a valid police certificate issued within the last six months is required for those over the age of 14. Attempting to enter from any other country requires a valid visa. \n Cayman Islands citizens, if they intend to travel directly to the U.S. from there, may obtain a single-entry visa waiver for about $25 prior to departure. A valid police certificate that was issued within the last three months is required for those over the age of 13. Attempting to enter from any other country will require you to have a valid visa. \n A criminal record will likely revoke any right to visa-free travel to the U.S. Although there are exceptions e.g. traffic violations, civil infractions (such as littering, noise violations, disorderly conduct), purely political offenses (e.g. non-violent protest in countries where it is not allowed), and offenses committed before the age of 16. Anyone with a criminal record, including Canadians and Bermudians, should seek advice from a U.S. embassy on whether they need to obtain a visa. \n  Visa Waiver Program requirements[edit]     Visa restrictions:Under new rules passed in 2015, travellers who have visited Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen on or after March 1, 2011, are not eligible to enter under the VWP. They remain eligible to apply for a regular tourism or business visa – at the expense of more cost and hassle than with the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Similarly, dual citizens who hold the citizenship of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria in addition to a nationality otherwise eligible for a visa waiver cannot enter under the VWP.\n  \n The program is open only to travellers who are in the United States for tourism or business purposes. You cannot be coming to the U.S. for formal education, to get a job, or to conduct journalism; if you are, you must get an appropriate visa in advance no matter how short your trip to the U.S. may be. \n The 90-day limit is not extendable. A short trip to Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean will not allow a fresh 90 days upon return to the U.S. An extended absence to the neighboring countries may reset the limit, particularly if your first trip to the U.S. was short. Take care if transiting through the U.S. on a trip around North America that exceeds 90 days. \n Having a criminal record, having been refused entry, or having been denied a U.S. visa will make you ineligible to enter on the VWP; you will have to apply for a U.S. visa instead. \n Entry under the VWP by air or sea requires the completion of an online form and a payment of $14, preferably 72 hours before arrival. The form is called the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). ESTA approval covers multiple trips and is valid for two years (unless your passport expires earlier). This requirement is waived if entering by land. \n All passports must be biometric. If your passport is an older one that was issued before biometric passports were available, you will need to obtain a new passport to travel to the U.S. on the VWP. \n Entry under the VWP by air or sea requires travel with a signatory carrier. Any commercial scheduled services to the U.S. will be fine, but if you are on a chartered flight or vessel you should check the status of the carrier, as you may require a visa. Flying your own personal aircraft, or sailing your own personal yacht to the U.S. will require you to obtain a tourist visa in advance. \n Travellers entering by air or sea should also have a return or onward ticket out of the United States. This requirement is not necessary for residents of Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, or the Caribbean. \n Entry under the VWP does not allow you to change your immigration status, and if you are denied entry, the decision can't be appealed and you will immediately be placed on the first flight out. \n  Obtaining a visa[edit]   U.S. Visa/Residence Status Overview\n \n\n  For the rest of the world, the visa application fee is a non-refundable $160 (as of October 2018) for visas that are not issued on the basis of a petition and $190 for those that are; this fee is waived under very limited circumstances, namely for people requesting certain exchange visitor visas. \n Depending on your nationality and the category of visa you are requesting, you may need to pay an additional fee (ranging from $7–200) only if the visa is issued. This is called a reciprocity fee and is charged by the U.S. to match the fees charged by other countries on U.S. citizens. \n Additionally, Chinese (PRC) citizens (that is, anyone travelling to the US on a PRC passport) must enroll in the Electronic Visa Update System (EVUS) for travel into the United States on any 10-year B-type visa. The enrollment is valid for two years (or until passport/visa expiry, whichever comes first) before it needs to be updated again. \n The Immigration and Nationality Act states that all persons requesting entry into the U.S. as non-immigrants are presumed to be immigrants until they overcome that presumption by showing evidence of \"binding ties\" to their home country, and sufficient proof that the visit will be temporary. Applicants also need to demonstrate that they are genuinely entitled to the visa they are applying for. Face-to-face interviews at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate are required for almost all nationalities, and waits for interview slots and visa processing can add up to several months. \n Embassies are closed on U.S. holidays and on holidays of the host country, so you need to know both holidays when setting dates to apply for a visa. You should start planning your trip far in advance, as the application process is known to take up to six months. \n Do not assume anything. Check on documentation requirements with the U.S. State Department or with the nearest U.S. consulate. \n Your visa is generally not tied to your permitted length of stay; for example, a 10-year visa does not allow a stay of 10 years. On the other hand, you can enter the country on the last day of validity of your visa and still be allowed to stay, for example, up to 180 days as a tourist. \n  Statue of Liberty, New York City \n \n\n  Travel to U.S. possessions[edit]  America's overseas possessions have slightly different rules. See each destination's article for details. \n In brief, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands all have the same entry requirements as the 50 states. However, Guam and the Northern Marianas apply the visa waiver program to a few additional countries, while the U.S. Virgin Islands also allows visa-free entry to citizens of the British Virgin Islands. \n American Samoa lies outside the federal immigration jurisdiction and has separate entry requirements. \n  Arriving in the United States[edit]   Immigration[edit]  See also: Global Entry, NEXUS On arrival, you will be questioned briefly at immigration to determine if your purpose of entry matches your visa class. If you are unable to convince immigration officers that you intend to abide by the terms of your visa, you will be refused entry and deported. \n Once they decide to let you in, you are fingerprinted and a digital photograph is taken. Entry will be denied if either of these procedures is refused. \n At selected airports, Canadian and VWP nationals may be able to use automated passport control (APC) kiosks to record their passport and biometric details. Household members traveling together can do this at once. VWP nationals need to have ESTA clearance, and have entered the U.S. at least once since 2008. If successful, the traveller gets a receipt and goes to the designated CBP desk to continue the inspection process. Canadians and other selected nationals may be eligible to participate in various trusted traveler programs such as Global Entry and NEXUS, which allow pre-approved passengers to use a designated kiosk for the inspection process. Unlike APC, these programs require prior application, background checks, an interview, and an application fee, but allows the passenger to bypass intense questioning and skip the lines at immigration for up to 5 years. \n Because marijuana is illegal under federal law, if you have consumed marijuana or invested in the marijuana industry, you can be banned from entering the United States. This is true even if marijuana is legal in your country and even if it's also legal in the state you're trying to enter. Border officials don't usually ask about marijuana, but if they see a reason to ask, they might. Even a single copy of \"High Times\" magazine or anything similar is enough to draw suspicion. If you admit to having used marijuana (or any other drug illegal under U.S. federal law) or invested in the industry, or if you are caught lying about it, you can be turned back and banned for life from entering the country. To appeal the ban, you have to apply for a $585 waiver. \n  Customs[edit]  Each household (i.e. family members living and traveling together) needs to complete one customs declaration form. Travellers eligible for APC, as well as Global Entry and NEXUS members, can do this electronically using the respective kiosks and need not fill up the paper form. Those eligible for Mobile Passport Control (U.S. citizens and some Canadian citizens) also do not need to fill out the form, provided they have completed the app's questions and have a QR code ready to go. Detailed and up-to-date information on prohibited and restricted items can be found at the relevant government website. \n Do not attempt to import items originating from countries against which the U.S. has imposed economic sanctions (Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan); they will be confiscated by customs if discovered. An exception to this rule is cigars and alcoholic beverages (mainly rum) originating from Cuba. With the ongoing thaw in U.S.–Cuban relations, the U.S. has lifted sanctions against importation of these items for personal use (limits are the same as for tobacco and alcohol originating elsewhere). \n The United States has very strict biosecurity laws, and imposes restrictions on the types of food that may be brought into the country. In general, fresh food may not be brought into the country, though some types of processed, commercially packaged food may be allowed, depending on the country of origin. Check with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for more details. All food and plant items being brought into the country must declared and inspected by customs, even if permitted. Failure to declare agricultural products can result in a fine, or in serious cases even prosecution. \n Besides your personal effects, which will go home with you, you are allowed to import individual gifts with a value of $100 or less per item. If you're 21 years of age or older, you may also import limited quantities of tobacco and alcohol products duty-free: \n If you are over the alcohol exemption by a small amount (e.g. a six pack of beer or a second bottle of wine) most customs officers will let this slide for wine and beer if you've made a full and accurate declaration. Anything more than this, or any hard spirits over the limit will likely result in duty and tax being assessed, the amount of which depends in part on the state you're entering to and the country the goods are from. (Duty from Canada, for example, is minimal owing in part to NAFTA.) Customs officers do not show this leniency with tobacco products; expect to pay if you are even one cigarette over! \n A reasonable quantity of perfume or cologne can also be imported provided the brand is not under a \"Trademark Restriction in the United States\". There is no restriction on the amount of money you can bring into or out of the U.S. However, if you are travelling with $10,000 or more (or its equivalent in foreign currency) per household, you must declare it on your customs form and you will be given a special form to fill out; not declaring exposes you to a fine and possible seizure of that cash. Checks, bonds and other financial instruments must also be declared. ATM/Debit cards linked to non-U.S. bank accounts carrying the said amount do not need to be declared (although your bank may impose some withdrawal restrictions and fees to access this money in the U.S.). \n The U.S. possessions of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands are outside the federal customs jurisdiction and each have their own separate requirements. Travel between these regions and the rest of the U.S. requires a customs check. There are some differences (mostly larger) in duty exemptions for U.S. citizens returning from these destinations. \n  Leaving the United States[edit]     Thinking of Overstaying?: Overstaying the period granted at passport control or violating your terms of entry (e.g. work on a B1/B2 status) will automatically invalidate your visa. It will also make it extremely difficult to re-enter the United States and may also bar you from re-entry for at least three years, if not permanently. If you overstayed on the Visa Waiver Program, you will need a visa for all future visits. If you overstay for compelling reasons such as medical emergencies and flight delays or cancellations, you will need to keep immigration officials informed of your situation in order to avoid any of the above sanctions. \n  \n Unlike most countries, the U.S. has no formal passport control upon exit, especially for those travelling by air or sea. As such, your airline or shipping company will document your departure and report it to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The CBP then updates your immigration record. Aliens who arrived in the U.S. by air or sea after mid-2013, and depart by air or sea do not need to do anything further. \n If you fall into one of the following categories, you may need to take further action to actively prove that you left the U.S. on time: \n  last arrived in the U.S. before mid-2013 through any means (when the paper I-94 card was still physically issued to foreigners): turn over the I-94 card to the airline staff at check-in, or to the Canadian or Mexican immigration officer if departing by land\n arrived in the U.S. via land or private vehicles (paper I-94 cards are still issued here): turnover the I-94 card to the airline staff at check-in, or to the Canadian or Mexican immigration officer if departing by land\n left the U.S. via land or private vehicles: save any evidence that you were outside the U.S. before your authorised stay expired\n  In any case, on future visits, consider bringing the necessary documents to prove you left legally. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has information about what to do if your slip is not collected. \n If you take a side trip to Canada or Mexico by land and return within 30 days or the allowed time of your stay (whichever is shorter), you may re-enter the U.S. provided that you do not yet return any issued I-94 card before you proceed to Canada or Mexico. This can also be done even if you entered the U.S. on a single-entry visa, or the visa you entered the U.S. with has expired. However, you will only be admitted for the remainder of your original allowed time; the deadline to leave the U.S. won't be extended by just leaving for somewhere else in North America. If you return the I-94 while on the side trip, you will have to apply all over again to enter the U.S. (which means a new visa for single-entry visa holders) and be subject to the usual questioning. \n Try to avoid re-entering the U.S. a few days, weeks or months after one visit. Even if you don't overstay, planning several U.S. visits spaced shortly after each other may be interpreted by immigration officers as \"immigrant intent\" and cause you grief. \n  By plane[edit]     Enhanced Security Measures: Under new rules implemented on October 26, 2017, passengers on flights to the United States are subject to more rigorous checks and security measures prior to boarding. Depending on the airline and point of departure, this may include a comprehensive bag search, as well as rigorous questioning by security personnel for all passengers prior to being allowed to board the aircraft. Be sure to arrive at the check-in counter at least 3 hours before your scheduled departure time, and also arrive at the boarding gate early so you have enough time to complete all security procedures.  \n   Seattle skyline\n \n\n Most visitors from outside Canada and Mexico arrive in the United States by plane. While many medium sized inland cities have an international airport, there are limited flights to most of these and most travelers find themselves entering the U.S. at one of the major entry points along the coasts. The international airports in Atlanta (ATL IATA), New York City (EWR IATA &amp; JFK IATA; for all airports, NYC IATA), Los Angeles (LAX IATA), Chicago (ORD IATA; for all airports, CHI IATA), San Francisco (SFO IATA), Seattle (SEA IATA), Miami (MIA IATA) and Houston (IAH IATA) are the main points of entry to the United States by plane. \n  Diamond Head &amp; Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Hawaii \n \n\n In general, major cities on the east coast have the best connections to Europe, Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East, while major cities on the west coast have the best connections to East Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Most sizeable cities would be served by at least one flight to a major Canadian city, while New York City, Miami, Los Angeles and Houston generally provide the best connections to Latin America. Direct air travel to/from Cuba was restored from Miami after a 55-year embargo was relaxed in 2014, but some Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) restrictions continue to apply; see the Americans in Cuba article. \n Unlike most other countries, the U.S. has never had a flag carrier. The \"big three\" legacy carriers, United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, are among the largest airlines in the world, and operate flights from various cities around the globe into their respective hubs. Other smaller U.S.-based airlines also fly internationally, though options are usually limited to destinations within the Americas. Most major European and East Asian airlines also fly from their respective countries into several of the major hubs, with British Airways in particular having one of the most comprehensive networks into U.S. cities from their hub in LondonHeathrow. \n The U.S. requires full entry formalities even for international transit. If you normally need a visa to visit the U.S. and can't avoid a transit, you will need at least a C-1 transit visa. If you are transferring to a domestic flight, you will need to go through customs and immigration at your first U.S. stop; make sure you allow ample time to make any transfers. \n Most airports have near the exit a wall of \"courtesy phones\" with the description and the prices of motels in the area. You can call these motels free of charge and ask for a room and a pick up shuttle will come to fetch you at the airport. It is very convenient and mostly free of charge (but you are supposed to tip the driver). \n  Airport security[edit]   TSA approved lock with symbol\n \n\n Security at U.S. airports is onerous, especially during busy holiday periods, and security procedures for commercial flights from the U.S. continue to evolve. Allow plenty of time (at least 15 minutes, sometimes more than 1 hour) and pack as lightly as possible. Security is handled by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), although details can vary slightly at each airport. Adults must show approved picture ID (a passport is sufficient). \n When connecting from an international flight, all passengers must go through security screening to continue on the onward flight, after clearing immigration and customs inspections. That means all liquids and prohibited items (per TSA rules) that were purchased in a Duty Free shop or allowed through as carry on from a foreign airport must re-packed into checked luggage after coming out of the customs area and before re-checking luggage. In most airports there is a check-in desk outside or conveyor belt outside of customs for transiting passengers to re-check their luggage. Items cannot be re-packed or re-arranged before customs inspections in the luggage reclaim area. \n There are limitations on liquids (including gels, aerosols, creams, and pastes) in carry-on baggage. Ensure that any liquids are held in containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces (100 mL). The containers must all be placed within a single zippered plastic bag that is 1 quart (946 mL) or less in size. Only one such bag, with however much liquid, is allowed per passenger. Medications (including saline solution for contact lenses) and infant and child nourishment are exempt but subject to additional testing; notify TSA agents if you are carrying these items, store them separately from your other liquids, and if possible clearly label them in advance. \n If you wish to lock your checked baggage, the TSA requires you to use special locks that have the Travel Sentry TSA lock system. These locks can be opened by TSA officials using a master key should they wish to inspect the contents of your bag. If your lock is not one of the TSA-approved locks, the TSA will break it open and you will not be entitled to any compensation for the damage. \n  Pre-clearance[edit]  From Canada Passengers whose journeys begin in major Canadian airports and involve either U.S. or Canadian carriers will usually be able to clear U.S. entry formalities (passport control and customs) at their Canadian port of exit. These flights are treated the same as U.S. domestic flights, and most Canadian carriers are located in U.S. domestic terminals or concourses in most airports. Some airports (such as LaGuardia Airport in New York City) that don't have customs and immigration facilities receive pre-cleared flights from Canada. \n Travellers on U.S.–Canadian flights operated by foreign carriers like Philippine Airlines and Cathay Pacific, and those from minor Canadian airports that do not have preclearance facilities, will still encounter traditional entry formalities upon arrival at their first U.S. stop; a Canadian transit visa may be required even if passengers are confined to a holding area for the entire transit time. \n Some airports in Canada, including Vancouver International Airport, Terminal 1 of Toronto-Pearson Airport, and Montréal-Trudeau Airport generally do not require passengers in transit from abroad to pass through Canadian Customs and Immigration controls before going through U.S. preclearance formalities. However, even if you pass through these airports, make sure that your papers are in order to allow you to enter Canada: if you cannot travel to the U.S. on the same day you go through preclearance, if you are not cleared for entry to the United States, or if you and/or your luggage is not checked through by your airline to at least your first destination in the United States, you must report to Canada Customs; a Canadian transit or temporary resident visa may be required. This arrangement does not apply in the reverse direction, meaning that you must pass through Canadian customs and immigration on your flight out. \n From other countries Preclearance facilities are available at Queen Beatrix International Airport in Aruba, Grand Bahama and Lynden Pindling International Airports in the Bahamas, Bermuda International Airport, Dublin and Shannon International Airports in Ireland, and Abu Dhabi International Airport in the United Arab Emirates. \n Passengers on British Airways flights from London to New York City transiting via either Dublin or Shannon, Ireland can take advantage of U.S. passport control and customs preclearance at Dublin or Shannon. \n  By car[edit]     Visa restrictions:All persons wishing to enter the United States by land must possess a valid passport; NEXUS, FAST, Global Entry, SENTRI, or passport card; Laser Visa; or an \"enhanced driver's license\" (issued by certain U.S. states and Canadian provinces)\n  \n The U.S.–Canada and U.S.–Mexico borders are two of the most frequently crossed borders with millions of crossings daily. Average wait times are up to 30 minutes, but some of the busiest crossings encounter considerable delays—approaching 1–2 hours at peak times (weekends, holidays). Current wait times (updated hourly) are available on the U.S. customs service website. The U.S.–Mexico border is lucrative for drug trafficking, so vehicles crossing may be X-rayed or searched by a drug-sniffing dog. If there is suspicion, your vehicle may be searched. Since this is an all-too-common event, expect no patience from border agents. \n Foreigners entering by land are required to pay a $6 fee when crossing the border. No fee is payable if you made a side trip to Canada or Mexico and are simply re-entering the U.S. \n  By bus[edit]  Greyhound offers inexpensive cross-border service from Canada and Mexico. Some routes, such as Toronto to Buffalo, have hourly service. Megabus U.S. also runs daily trips from Toronto (also a hub for Megabus Canada) to New York City via Buffalo for as low as $1. \n One of the routes of the city bus system of Windsor, Ontario (the Tunnel Bus) takes passengers to Detroit -- pedestrians or bicycles are not allowed on the bridge, in the tunnel, or on the ferry. \n Bus passengers often experience greater scrutiny from U.S. customs officials than car or train passengers. \n   Ellis Island, the main historic terminus for immigrants coming from Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and parts of South America.\n \n\n  By boat[edit]  Entry by sea is not very common today. The most common entry points for private boats are Los Angeles, or Florida and other Eastern coastal states. Some passenger ferries from Canada exist, mostly between British Columbia and Washington State or Alaska. \n Cunard offers transatlantic ship travel between the United Kingdom and New York City. \n The ferries between British Columbia and Washington state are treated as land border crossings rather than sea entry points. This means that while ESTA is not required for VWP visitors, visitors entering the U.S. this way will be required to pay the $6 entry fee levied at land border crossings. \n  By train[edit]  Amtrak offers international service from the Canadian cities of Vancouver (Amtrak Cascades has two trips per day to Seattle), Toronto (Maple Leaf once daily to New York City via Niagara Falls), and Montreal (Adirondack once daily to New York City via Albany). \n On international trains from Montreal and Toronto, immigration formalities are conducted at the border; this takes significantly more time than it would on a bus, which means the bus is often less expensive and faster than the train. \n Travellers from Vancouver clear U.S. immigration and customs at Pacific Central Station before they get on the train itself, just as they do for air travel. Be sure to allow enough time for inspections.\n From Mexico the nearest Amtrak stations are in San Diego, Yuma, Del Rio and El Paso. Amtrak trains do not cross the border into Mexico so passengers continue to the border by local public transportation or by taxi from the Amtrak station. There are no passenger trains to the border from anywhere in Mexico. \n  By foot[edit]  There are many border crossings in urban areas which can be crossed by pedestrians. Crossings such as those in or near Niagara Falls, Detroit, Tijuana, Nogales, and El Paso are popular for persons wishing to spend a day on the other side of the border. In some cases, this may be ideal for day-trippers, as crossing by car can be a much longer wait. \n  Get around[edit]   The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California\n \n\n The size of the U.S. and the distance separating major cities make air the dominant mode of travel for short-term travellers. If you have time, travel by car, bus, or rail can be interesting. \n Some states offer traffic and public transport information by dialing 511 on your phone. \n Quarantine restrictions are in place when traveling between the continental U.S. and Hawaii. \n  By plane[edit]  See also: Flying in the United States The quickest and often the most convenient method of long-distance intercity travel in the U.S. is by plane. Coast-to-coast travel takes about 6 hours from east to west, and 5 hours from west to east (varying due to winds), compared to the days necessary for land transportation. Most large cities in the U.S. are served by one or two airports; many smaller towns also have some passenger air service, although you may need to detour through a major hub airport to get there. Depending on where you are starting, it may be cheaper to drive to a nearby large city and fly or, conversely, to fly to a large city near your destination and rent a car. \n The largest airlines are the three remaining mainline legacy carriers (American Airlines, Delta, and United) and two of the country's low-cost carriers, Southwest and JetBlue. Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are legacy regional carriers, while smaller airlines Spirit, Frontier, Allegiant and Sun Country are trying to make inroads. There are also smaller regional airlines that are subsidiaries of the mainline carriers and can be booked through their parents. \n Major carriers compete for business on major routes, and travellers willing to book two or more weeks in advance can get bargains. However most smaller destinations are served by only one or two regional carriers, and prices there can be expensive. The difference in fees and service between low-cost and mainline carriers is, however, virtually nonexistent these days. Low-cost carriers occasionally offer more amenities than mainline carriers, such as inflight entertainment for even a short-haul flight, or free checked baggage in the price of their tickets. Southwest Airlines, for instance, allows passengers to check in up to two pieces of bags in their base price. \n  Security[edit]  See § Security under § Get in - By plane  By private plane[edit]  See also: General aviation The cost of chartering the smallest private jet begins at around $4000 per flight hour, with the cost substantially higher for larger, longer-range aircraft, and cheaper for smaller propeller planes. While private flying is by no means inexpensive, a family of four or more can often fly together at a cost similar to or even favorable to buying first-class commercial airline tickets, especially to smaller airports where scheduled commercial flights are at their most expensive, and private flying is at its cheapest. Though you may find it cheaper than flying a family of four first-class internationally, it is rarely the case, except when traveling from Western Europe. General aviation is the most practical way to reach the outer boroughs of Alaska. \n Air charter refers to hiring a private plane for a one-time journey. Jet Cards are pre-paid cards entitling the owner to a specific number of flight hours on a specified aircraft. As all expenses are pre-paid on the card, you need not concern yourself with deadhead time, return flights, landing fees, etc. \n Many small-town airports on America's borders welcome individually-owned small aircraft. Give them an hour or two advance notice so that they can fetch border officials to meet the tiny private plane from exotic and foreign Brockville, and you've provided just the excuse they needed to add \"International Airport\" to their names. \n  By train[edit]  See also: Rail travel in the United States  Westbound Southwest Chief in Colorado\n \n\n Due to the popularity of flying and cars, the passenger rail network in the United States is a shadow of what it was a century ago. While the United States still has the world's longest rail network, it is primarily used for freight transport these days. Except for certain corridors (mostly in the Northeast where a second cousin of high speed rail is available), passenger trains in the United States can be surprisingly scarce, slow, unreliable, and expensive. The national rail system, Amtrak☏+1-800-USA-RAIL (872-7245), provides service to many cities, offering exceptional sightseeing opportunities, but not particularly efficient inter-city travel, and is often more expensive than a flight. In more urban locations, Amtrak can be very efficient and comfortable, but in rural areas delays are common. Plan ahead to ensure train travel between your destinations is available and/or convenient. They have promotional discounts of 15% for students and seniors, and a 30-day U.S. Rail Pass for international travellers only. If you plan to buy a regular ticket within a week of travelling, it pays to check the website for sometimes significant \"weekly specials\". There is no dedicated high-speed rail network in the United States, and driving yourself will often be quicker than taking the train when travelling long distances. \n Amtrak offers many amenities and services that are lacking from other modes of transport. Amtrak's routes traverse some of America's most beautiful areas. Travellers with limited time may not find travel by train to be convenient, simply because the country is big, and that \"bigness\" is particularly evident in many of the scenic areas. For those with ample time, though, train travel offers an unparalleled view of the U.S.. Some of the most scenic routes include the California Zephyr that runs between Emeryville in the Bay Area of California to Chicago and the Empire Builder that goes from Chicago to Seattle or Portland. Both offer a lounge car with floor-to-ceiling windows and double decker cars. \n During usual American vacation times, some long-distance trains (outside the Northeast) can sell out weeks or even months in advance. Booking early also results in generally lower fares for all trains. Same-day reservations are usually easy, and depending on the rules of the fare you purchased, you can change travel plans on the day itself without fees. \n Separate from Amtrak, many major cities offer very reliable commuter trains that carry passengers to and from the suburbs or other relatively close-by areas. Some commuter train stations have park and ride facilities where you can park your car to use the commuter train to get to a city's downtown core where traffic and parking problems complicate car use. Parking rates at the stations vary (some facilities may be operated by third parties). Some commuter train systems and services do not operate on weekends and holidays, and even those that do often have greatly reduced frequencies, so it's best to check the system's website to plan ahead. Buy tickets before you board the train as you will either face a substantially more expensive fare or a hefty fine. \n  By boat[edit]  America has the largest system of inland waterways of any country in the world. It is entirely possible to navigate around within the United States by boat. Your choices of watercraft range from self-propelled canoes and kayaks to elaborate houseboats and riverboat cruises. \n Rivers and canals were key to developing the country, and traversing by boat gives you a unique perspective on the nation and some one of a kind scenery. Some examples of waterways open to recreational boating and/or scheduled cruises are: \n Each year, many beginning boaters successfully navigate these waterways. Any kind of boating requires some preparation and planning. In general, the Coast Guard, Canal and Seaway authorities go out of their way to help recreational boaters. They will also at times give instructions which you are expected to obey immediately. For example, small craft may be asked to give way to larger craft on canals, and weather conditions may require you to stop or change your route. \n Regular ferries exist to a variety of destinations on the coast. In the northwest of the country, you can travel with the ferries of the Alaska Marine Highway System from Bellingham (Washington) all the way along Alaska's southern coast to Dutch Harbor-Unalaska. As a bonus you get to enjoy beautiful mountain and archipelago scenery. Moreover, much of off-the-beaten-path-Alaska is just accessible by boat. There is no commercial passenger service between the continental U.S. and Hawaii. \n  By car[edit]  See also: Driving in the United States  The \"High Five\" five-Level interchange in Dallas \n \n\n America's love affair with the automobile is legendary, so travelling the United States without a car can be difficult. Most American cities have developed with automobiles in mind, so renting or bringing your own car is usually a very good idea. There are only a few major cities where using public transportation is preferable to driving: New York City, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, and Washington. Other very large cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Miami have limited public transport options, and the options only get worse in smaller cities. Taxis and ride-hailing services are often available, but they can get expensive and taxis (especially) can be hard to find outside of airports. While most Americans are happy to give driving directions, don't be surprised if many aren't familiar with the local public transport options available. \n Traffic signs do not conform to international standards but, if you understand English, they should be self-explanatory. \n The national road system consists of \n Be careful with road signs, as any of these can morph into state routes, interstates, or highways with little warning other than size and signs. \n All of them are generally well maintained by the respective states, but while the main Interstate system generally links only the major towns of every state (hence the name: Interstate), the U.S. highway and state routes can lead you to many interesting off-the-beaten-path sights, if you don't mind stopping at traffic lights and dealing with pedestrians. Most sections of the roads are free to use, but there are some which levy fees. \n  Great American Road Trip[edit]    Route 66, a highway connecting Los Angeles with Chicago. Essentially the main route for the Great American Road trip. It also invokes nostalgia in the southwestern states.\n \n\n A romantic appeal is attached to the idea of long-distance car travel; many Americans will tell you that you can't see the \"real\" America except by car. Given the scarcity of public transportation in most American cities, the loss of time travelling between cities by car rather than flying can be made up by the convenience of driving around within cities once you arrive. In addition, many of the country's major natural attractions, such as the Grand Canyon, are almost impossible to get to without an automobile or on a bus tour. If you have the time, a classic American road trip with a rented car is very easy to achieve. (You may have to shop around a bit for a one-way rental. Pay attention to how many miles they allow you to put on the vehicle, since you probably want to make detours for sightseeing.) Because of the distances, this kind of travel can mean many long days behind the wheel, so pay attention to the comfort of the car you use. A \"coast-to-coast\" trip with more than one driver and few stops will take at least 5 days (41⁄2 if you have strong bladders). \n  Driving laws[edit]  Driving law is primarily a matter of state law and is enforced by state and local police. While there are some minor variations state-to-state, the rules of the road are fairly consistent across the country. All states publish an official driver's handbook which summarizes state driving laws in plain English, with some states providing a Spanish version as well. These handbooks are usually available both on the Web and at many government offices. AAA publishes a AAA/CAA Digest of Motor Laws, which is now available online for free that covers especially a few difference of traffic rules applied by all U.S. states and Canadian provinces. \n Foreign visitors age 18 and older can usually drive on their foreign driver's license for up to a year, depending on state law. Licenses that are not in English must be accompanied by an International Driving Permit (IDP) or a certified translation. Persons who stay in the United States for more than a year must obtain a driver's license from the state they are residing in, though exceptions might apply depending on the state they are in (e.g. some states waive this requirement for those on student visas). Written and practical driving tests are usually required, but they are sometimes waived for holders of some Canadian and European licenses. \n Americans drive on the right in left-hand drive vehicles, the same as Canada and Mexico. \n  A 5-light signal (left) indicating that both straight and left-turning traffic has the right of way. If just the green circle was displayed, without a green left arrow, left-turning traffic would have to yield to oncoming traffic.\n \n\n Most American drivers tend to drive calmly and safely in residential neighborhoods. However, downtown surface streets and big-city expressways often become crowded with a lot of \"hurried\" drivers, who will exceed speed limits, make unsafe lane changes, or follow other cars at unsafe close distances (\"tailgating\"). Speed limits are variable depending on the area in which you are driving; enforcement is unpredictable and varies widely from state to state. Keeping pace with other drivers will usually avoid trouble. Beware of small towns along otherwise high-speed rural roads (and medium-speed suburban roads); the lower speed limits within these towns are strictly enforced. \n  By bus[edit]  See also: Long-distance bus travel in the United States Intercity bus travel is widespread, but not available everywhere. Service between nearby major cities is extremely frequent, and often connect many smaller towns with regional cities. It's commonly considered a \"lower class\" way to travel, but is generally dependable, safe and affordable. However, bus stations in some cities are located in rough neighborhoods (e.g. Los Angeles). \n Greyhound Bus Lines (☏+1-800-231-2222) and several affiliated lines such as Bolt Bus have the predominant share of American bus travel in 45 states. Discounts are available to travellers who purchase their tickets 7–14 days in advance of their travel date. Greyhound buses typically run in 5-7 hour segments, at which time all passengers must get off the bus so it can be serviced, even if it's the middle of the night. Continuing passengers are boarded before those just getting on. Seating is on a first-come, first-served basis, except in some cities, where you can pay a $5 fee for priority seating. \n Megabus, Greyhound's biggest competitor, operates mainly in 30 states in the Midwestern and the eastern half of the country between the hub cities of Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, New Orleans, New York, Washington DC and several other cities surrounding and between the hubs. It also offers connections to Montreal and Toronto in Canada. It also has a couple of routes in the west, which are not connected to the other ones in the Midwest and the East Coast. \n Chinatown buses are small independent companies that provide curb-side departures for a cheap standard cash fare. These lines operate mainly in the northeast between Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Washington DC, and Baltimore. Some continue further out to destinations in the Midwest and the South from the northeast. Others operate between California, Nevada and Arizona. See the relevant city guides and GoToBus.com for more information. \n Hispanic bus companies tend to have the most spacious buses in the country. Many are affiliate brands or subsidiaries of Mexican bus companies offering cross-border services beyond the border areas to as a far north as Chicago, to as far east as Atlanta and as far south as Mexico City. Connections from Texas hubs to the Midwest including Chicago, the Southeast and Mexico are offered by Tornado Bus, El Expreso, Omnibus Mexicanos and Turimex Internacional. Service in and out of Florida is offered by the Chilean JetSet, Argentinian RedCoach, and Cuban-American La Cubana. In California and the Southwest operators include FuturaNet, Tufesa, InterCalifornias and El Paso-Los Angeles Limousines, which may have tickets starting from $1. \n Various smaller companies offer bus services throughout the country. A number of them are grouped under the Trailways brand, which you'll often find sharing space with Greyhound. \n All but the smallest cities and metro areas have some sort of local bus service, but it will often be limited compared to cities of a similar size in other countries. In general in the U.S., local buses don't stop at every stop. In some cities they'll stop if they see someone waiting at the bus stop, but in others you may have to give a little wave to let them know you want to get on. If you're on the bus and want to get off at the next stop, there's usually a button for you to push or a string to pull to signal the driver. \n  By recreational vehicle (RV)[edit]  Main article: Car camping Recreational vehicles – large, sometimes bus-sized vehicles that include sleeping and living quarters – are a distinctly American way to cruise the country. Some RVers love the convenience of being able to drive their home anywhere they like and enjoy the camaraderie that RV campgrounds offer. Other people dislike the hassles and maintenance issues that come with RVing. And don't even think about driving an RV into a huge metropolis such as New York. Still, if you want to drive extensively within the United States and are comfortable handling a big rig, renting an RV is an option you should consider. \n  By motorcycle[edit]  The thrill and exhilaration of cross country travel are magnified when you go by motorcycle. Harley-Davidson is the preeminent American motorcycle brand and Harley operates a motorcycle rental program for those licensed and capable of handling a full weight motorcycle. In some parts of the country, you can also rent other types of motorcycles, such as sportbikes, touring bikes, and dual-sport bikes. For those inexperienced with motorcycles, Harley and other dealerships offer classes for beginners. Wearing a helmet, although not required in all states, is always a good idea. The practice of riding between lanes of slower cars, also known as \"lane-sharing\" or \"lane-splitting,\" is illegal, except in California where it is tolerated and widespread. Solo motorcyclists can legally use \"high-occupancy vehicle\" or \"carpool\" lanes during their hours of operation. \n American enthusiasm towards motorcycles has led to a motorcycling subculture. Motorcycle clubs are exclusive clubs for members dedicated to riding a particular brand of motorcycle within a highly structured club hierarchy. Riding clubs may or may not be organized around a specific brand of bikes and offer open membership to anyone interested in riding. Motorcycle rallies, such as the famous one in Sturgis, South Dakota, are huge gatherings of motorcyclists from around the country. Many motorcyclists are not affiliated with any club and opt to ride independently or with friends. In general, motorcycling is seen as a hobby, as opposed to a practical means of transportation; this means, for example, that most American motorcyclists prefer not to ride in inclement weather. However you choose to ride, and whatever brand of bike you prefer, motorcycling can be a thrilling way to see the country. \n  By thumb[edit]   Gateway Arch, St. Louis, Missouri in the Midwest\n \n\n A long history of hitchhiking comes out of the U.S., with record of automobile hitchhikers as early as 1911. The specifics of the law vary from state to state, but in general, hitchhiking itself is legal throughout the majority of the country, though generally not on Interstate highways (where pedestrians are normally prohibited) or while standing within traffic lanes (usually marked by a solid white line at the shoulder of the road). If you plan to hitchhike, best practice is to thumb rides at entrance ramps, or (better yet) highway rest areas. \n However, due to increasing wariness of the possible dangers (fueled in part by sensational stories in the news media), hitchhiking in the U.S. is much less common than it used to be. International travelers to the U.S. should avoid this practice unless they have either a particularly strong sense of social adventure or extremely little money. Even many Americans themselves would only feel comfortable \"thumbing a ride\" if they had a good knowledge of the locale, and American drivers also practice caution for the same reasons. \n Craigslist has a rideshare section that sometimes proves useful for arranging rides in advance. If you are open with your destination it's almost always possible to find a ride going somewhere in the country, with payment often being sharing the fuel costs. \n  See[edit]   Portland Head Lighthouse, Portland, Maine, in New England \n \n\n The United States is extraordinarily diverse in its array of attractions. You will never run out of things to see; even if you think you've exhausted what one place has to offer, the next destination is only a road trip away. \n The Great American Road Trip (see above) is the most traditional way to see a variety of sights; just hop in the car and cruise down the Interstates, stopping at the convenient roadside hotels and restaurants as necessary, and stopping at every interesting tourist trap along the way, until you reach your destination. \n Indescribably beautiful scenery, history that reads like a screenplay, entertainment options that can last you for days, and some of the world's greatest architecture—no matter what your pleasure, you can find it almost anywhere you look in the United States. \n  Natural scenery[edit]   Jordan Pond in Acadia National Park, Maine \n \n\n From the spectacular glaciers of Alaska to the wooded, weathered peaks of Appalachia; from the otherworldly desertscapes of the Southwest to the vast waters of the Great Lakes; few other countries have as wide a variety of natural scenery as the United States does. \n America's National Parks are a great place to start, and to see North American wildlife. Yellowstone National Park was the first true national park in the world, and it remains one of the most famous, but there are 60 others. The Grand Canyon is possibly the world's most spectacular gorge; Sequoia National Park and Yosemite National Park are both home to the world's tallest living organisms; Glacier National Park is a great place to see huge sheets of ice; Canyonlands National Park could easily be mistaken for Mars; and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park features abundant wildlife among beautifully forested mountains. And the national parks aren't just for sightseeing, either; each has plenty of outdoors activities as well. \n   Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Carlsbad, New Mexico, in the Southwest.\n \n\n Still, the National Parks are just the beginning. The National Park Service also operates National Monuments, National Memorials, National Historic Sites, National Seashores, National Heritage Areas... the list goes on and on. And each state has its own state parks that can be just as good as the federal versions. Most all of these destinations, federal or state, have an admission fee, but it all goes toward maintenance and operations of the parks, and the rewards are well worth it. \n Those aren't your only options, though. Many of America's natural treasures can be seen without passing through admission gates. The world-famous Niagara Falls straddle the border between Canada and the U.S.; the American side lets you get right up next to the onrush and feel the power that has shaped the Niagara gorge. The \"purple majesty\" of the Rocky Mountains can be seen for hundreds of miles in any direction, while the placid coastal areas of the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic have relaxed Americans for generations. And, although they are very different from each other, Hawaii and Alaska are perhaps the two most scenic states; they don't just have attractions—they are attractions. \n  Historical attractions[edit]    Taos Pueblo, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and one of the largest pre-Columbian settlements in the southwest.\n \n\n The U.S. has a tremendous wealth of historical attractions—more than enough to fill months of history-centric touring. \n The prehistory of the continent can indeed be a little hard to uncover, as most of the Native American tribes did not build permanent settlements. But particularly in the West, you will find magnificent cliff dwellings at sites such as Mesa Verde and Bandelier, as well as near-ubiquitous rock paintings (Petroglyph National Park has some of the best rock art in the country, and it is located only 17 km outside of Albuquerque). The Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. is another great place to start learning about America's culture before the arrival of Europeans colonists. \n The first successful British colony on the continent was at Jamestown, Virginia, although the settlement at Plymouth, Massachusetts, may loom larger in the nation's mind. The eastern states of New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the South have more than their fair share of sites from early American history as they make up what are known as the 13 Original Colonies. \n In the 18th century, major centers of commerce developed in Philadelphia and Boston, and as the colonies grew in size, wealth, and self-confidence, relations with Great Britain became strained, culminating in the Boston Tea Party and the ensuing Revolutionary War. \n There are a large number of historic sites related to the American Civil War, the most destructive conflict on American soil. \n  Monuments and architecture[edit]  Americans have never shied away from heroic feats of engineering, and many of them are among the country's biggest tourist attractions. \n Washington, D.C., as the nation's capital, has more monuments and statuary than you could see in a day, but do be sure to visit the Washington Monument (the world's tallest obelisk), the stately Lincoln Memorial, and the incredibly moving Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The city's architecture is also an attraction—the Capitol Building and the White House are two of the most iconic buildings in the country and often serve to represent the whole nation to the world. \n A number of American cities have world-renowned skylines, perhaps none more so than the concrete canyons of Manhattan, part of New York City. There, a new World Trade Center tower has risen on a site adjacent to the fallen twin towers, and the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building still stand tall, as they have for almost a century. Chicago, where the skyscraper was invented, can no longer claim the tallest building in the country, but it still has an awful lot of really tall buildings. Other skylines worth seeing include San Francisco (with the Golden Gate Bridge), Seattle (including the Space Needle), Miami, and Pittsburgh. \n  Abraham Lincoln's tomb, in Springfield, Illinois.\n \n\n Some human constructions transcend skyline, though, and become iconic symbols in their own right. The Gateway Arch in St. Louis, the Statue of Liberty in Manhattan, the Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, and even the fountains of the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas all draw visitors to their respective cities. Even the incredible Mount Rushmore, located far from any major city, still attracts two million visitors each year. \n  Museums and galleries[edit]  In the U.S., there's a museum for practically everything. From toys to priceless artifacts, from entertainment legends to dinosaur bones—nearly every city in the country has a museum worth visiting. \n The highest concentrations of these museums are found in the largest cities, of course, but none compare to Washington, D.C., home to the Smithsonian Institution. With almost twenty independent museums, most of them located on the National Mall, the Smithsonian is the foremost curator of American history and achievement. The most popular of the Smithsonian museums are the National Air and Space Museum, the National Museum of American History, and the National Museum of Natural History, but any of the Smithsonian museums would be a great way to spend an afternoon—and they're all 100% free. \n New York City also has an outstanding array of world-class museums, including the Guggenheim Museum, the American Museum of Natural History,the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, and the Ellis Island Immigration Museum. \n You could spend weeks exploring the cultural institutions just in D.C. and the Big Apple, but there are also many other cities with world class museums such as Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Boston. Many universities also operate small museums that have interesting exhibits and are often free to enter, while those interested in specific sports or topics will often be able to find museums even in some small towns that suit their tastes. \n  Itineraries[edit]  Here is a handful of itineraries spanning regions across the United States: \n  Do[edit]   Arts and music[edit]  Mid-size to large cities often draw big ticket concerts, especially in large outdoor amphitheaters. Small towns sometimes host concerts in parks with local or older bands. Other options include music festivals such has San Diego's Street Scene or South by Southwest in Austin. Classical music concerts are held year round and performed by semi-professional and professional symphonies. Many cities and regions have unique sounds. Country music is popular throughout the U.S. but is particularly concentrated in the South and rural West. Nashville is known as \"Music City\" because of the large number of country artists who live in the city. It's home to the Grand Ole Opry, one of the most famous music venues in the country. Many of the most popular mainstream bands are based in Los Angeles due to the large entertainment presence and concentration of record companies. \n America is considered to be the spiritual home of musical theater, and many of the world's most famous musicals have had a run on Broadway in New York City at one time or another. No trip to New York would be complete without catching at least one musical on Broadway. The United States is also home to one of the world's premier opera companies, the Metropolitan Opera in New York, and to other well-regarded opera companies like the San Francisco Opera and the Lyric Opera of Chicago. \n A quintessential American experience is the marching band festival. You can find these events almost every weekend between September and Thanksgiving throughout the country and again from March to June in California. Check local event listings and papers to find specifics. Also notable is the Bands of America Grand National Championship held every autumn in Indianapolis. To see the best of the best, get tickets to the \"finals\" performance, where the ten best bands of the festival compete for the championship. Both \"street\" or parade marching bands as well as \"field\" or show bands are found at almost every high school and university in America. \n  Sports[edit]   Baseball in Daytona Beach, Florida \n \n\n The United States has a professional league for virtually every sport, including pillow fighting. America's passion for sports is rivaled hardly anywhere in the world, with the leagues with the world's highest attendance both per game (NFL) and total (MLB) and other leagues that are the best and most popular in their respective sport. Watching a game is a good way to meet and interact with the locals. A few of the most popular sports are: \n  \"Hockey\" vs \"Ice hockey\"\n In most English-speaking countries, \"hockey\" is used for a game played on grass and \"ice hockey\" for the one on ice. In North American usage, however, the former is called \"field hockey\", while \"hockey\" alone almost always means \"ice hockey\" (or, rarely, roller hockey). \n  One unique feature of the American sports landscape is the extent to which sports are associated with educational institutions. In many regions, college sports (local or university teams), especially in football and men's basketball, enjoy followings that rival or surpass those of major professional teams. (In fact, 8 of the 10 largest stadiums in the world — all seating more than 100,000 spectators — are for U.S. college football teams, and the country's four largest basketball arenas house college teams.) The NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) has over 1,000 member schools, including almost all of the country's best-known colleges and universities. The college football season runs from roughly September 1 through mid-December, with postseason bowl games running into early January. The college basketball regular season begins in mid-November and ends in late February or early March, followed by post-season tournaments that run through early April. The NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, \"March Madness\", is especially widely followed even by casual sports fans. Rowing enthusiasts may wish to watch the Harvard–Yale Regatta, a 4-mile-long (6.4 km) race held in Connecticut every year between the men's coxed eight rowing teams. \n Many communities also take great pride in their high school sports teams, and especially in smaller locales, those teams are a major part of local culture. From August to May, a high school game can be a great (and cheap) way to meet locals and discover the area in a way many visitors never experience. The most popular sports are usually football and boys' basketball (and to a lesser extent girls' basketball), plus hockey in New England and the upper Midwest. In some areas, a particular high school sport enjoys an elevated cultural position. Examples include football in Texas, basketball in Indiana, hockey in Minnesota, and wrestling in Iowa. \n The United States is home to many of the world's most famous golf courses. The most famous is the Augusta National Golf Club, which is the home of the Masters, one of the world's most prestigious professional golf tournaments, and also one of the four majors in men's golf. The U.S. is also home to 2 of the other 3 majors in men's golf, namely the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship, which rotate between different golf courses in the U.S. every year. Golf is popular both as a participation and spectator sport, and the U.S. supports several major professional tours. See also Golf#United States of America. \n The United States hosts many tennis tournaments in the ATP and WTA tours, with the US Open being the most prestigious among them. It is regarded as one of the four Grand Slams. The US Open is held every year from late August to Early September at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City. \n The rodeo celebrates the traditions of the Old West, especially in Texas and the Great Plains. A subset of rodeo, bull riding, enjoys a moderate degree of popularity as a standalone event, with the main circuit being Professional Bull Riders. \n  Festivals and fairs[edit]   The Iowa State Fair, one of the most well-known state fairs. Common sights at state fairs include food stalls, amusement rides, and local booths selling goods.\n \n\n Many towns and/or counties throw fairs to commemorate the establishment of a town or the county with rides, games, and other attractions. Almost every state has one or more state fairs. These began as competitions and shows to promote agriculture and livestock; now they include industrial product exhibitions, concerts, and carnival rides and games. \n  Nature[edit]  There are numerous national parks throughout the United States, especially the vast interior, which offer plenty of opportunities to enjoy outdoor activities, including Recreational shooting, ATV riding, hiking, bird watching, prospecting, and horseback riding. National parks are the crown jewels of the much larger National Park System, which also includes historic and cultural landmarks. \n  Amusement parks[edit]  The United States is the birthplace of the modern amusement park, and to this day, amusement parks form an integral part of American childhood and teenage culture. The first ever permanent amusement park was built on Coney Island in New York City, and while not as glamorous as some of the newer ones, is still home to a famous historic wooden roller coaster and numerous other attractions. \n The Los Angeles and Orlando areas in particular are home to numerous well-regarded amusement parks, with giants Universal and Disney operating parks in both locations. Another chain of amusement parks that is well-regarded locally, though not so well-known internationally, is Six Flags, which has multiple locations throughout the country, and is particularly known for its innovative roller coasters and other thrill rides. Other chains include the marine-themed SeaWorld, which is known for its marine mammal shows, and Cedar Fair. \n  Buy[edit]   Money[edit]   The most recent designs of U.S. $100, $50, $20, $10, $5, $2 and $1 bills. Older styles are still frequently seen in circulation.\n \n\n The official U.S. currency is the United States dollar ($), divided into 100 cents (¢, but often written as decimal dollars). Foreign currencies are almost never accepted, though some major hotel chains may accept traveller's checks in other currencies. Establishments close to the Canadian border accept Canadian currency, though usually at poor exchange rates. The Mexican peso can also be used (again at poor exchange rates) in border towns like El Paso and Laredo. Japanese yen is sometimes accepted in Hawaii. \n The dollar is sometimes colloquially known as a buck, so \"5 bucks\" means $5. Common American banknotes (or bills) are the $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. The $2 bill is still produced but rarely seen in circulation and is occasionally refused as payment; bills beyond $100 haven't been produced since the 1960s and are removed from circulation when found. The $100 and sometimes $50 bills are too valuable for small transactions, and may be refused. All $1 and $2 bills and older bills of the other denominations are greenish and printed with black and green ink (thus the nickname \"greenbacks\"). Newer versions of the $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills are slightly more colorful. All the bills are the same size. Banknotes never expire and several designs of each note can circulate together, but older designs that lack modern anti-counterfeiting features may (rarely) be refused by some retailers. \n The standard coins are the penny (1¢, copper color), the chunky nickel (5¢, silver color), the tiny dime (10¢, silver color) and the ridged-edge quarter (25¢, silver color). These coins only have their values written in words, not figures: \"one cent\", \"five cents\", \"one dime\", and \"quarter dollar\". When it comes to value, size doesn't matter: the dime is the smallest coin, followed by the penny, nickel, and quarter. Half dollar (50¢, silver) and dollar ($1, gold) coins exist but are uncommon. Coin-operated machines usually only accept nickels, dimes, quarters, and $1 bills, though some may also accept dollar coins. Larger vending machines, such as for buses or postal stamps, may take $5, $10, or even $20 bills. Though Canadian coins are sized similarly, machines usually reject them. Humans, on the other hand, generally won't notice (or care about) a few small Canadian coins mixed with American, particularly in the northern parts of the country. As with most currency, coins are generally not exchangeable abroad and UNICEF provides donation boxes at airports to let you dispose of them for a good cause before flying abroad. \n  Currency exchange and banking[edit]   Exchange rates for U.S. dollars\n As of 31 July 2019: \n Exchange rates fluctuate. Current rates for these and other currencies are available from XE.com\n  Currency exchange centers are rare outside the downtowns of major coastal and border cities, and international airports. Some banks also provide currency exchange services, though you may sometimes be required to call in advance. Due to the high overhead of exchange rates and transaction fees, it is often better to acquire U.S. dollars in your home country before travel; rates at currency exchange desks in airports, tourist areas and shopping areas in particular are often terrible. \n ATMs can handle foreign bank cards or credit cards bearing Visa/Plus or MasterCard/Cirrus logos. They usually dispense bills in $20 denominations and generally charge about $2-4 to cards issued by other banks. Smaller ATMs in restaurants, petrol stations, etc., often charge higher fees (up to $5). These fees are in addition to your card issuer's own fees. Some ATMs, such as those at courthouses or other government buildings, have no fee. As with anywhere else in the world, there is a risk of card skimmers installed on these machines that can steal your credit card details. \n Another option is withdrawing cash (usually up to $40 or $60 over the cost of your goods) when making a debit card purchase at a supermarket, convenience store, or a large discount store such as Walmart. Stores almost never charge for this service (though it may be contingent on signing up for the store's loyalty program, which is also usually free); however, the bank that issued your card may impose a fee. \n Opening a bank account in the U.S. is a fairly straightforward process, and there are no restrictions on foreigners having them. \n  Credit and debit cards[edit]  Major credit cards such as Visa and Mastercard (and their debit card affiliates) are widely used and accepted. Nearly all large retailers will accept credit cards for transactions of all sizes, even as small as $1 or $2. However, some small businesses and independently-owned stores specify a minimum amount of money (usually $2 or $5, but sometimes $10) for credit card use, as such transactions cost them $0.30–0.50 (this practice is also common at bars when opening a tab). Almost all sit-down restaurants, hotels, and shops will accept credit and debit cards; those that do not post a sign saying \"Cash Only.\" Other cards such as American Express and Discover are also accepted, but not as widely. Many retailers have a window sticker or counter sign showing the logos of the credit cards they accept. \n JCB, UnionPay (China) and RuPay (India) have alliances with Discover, so they can be used at any retailer that accepts Discover cards even if the store does not display the logo on its window. \n Shops may also ask for photo identification for foreign-issued cards. When making large purchases, it is typical for U.S. retailers to ask to see some form of photo identification. Sometimes, credit/debit cards are the only means to perform a transaction. If you do not have one, you can purchase a prepaid card or gift card with Visa, MasterCard or AmEx logo in a good number of stores, but you may have to provide identification before the card is activated. \n Transaction authorization is made by signing a paper sales slip or a computer pad, although many retailers will waive the signature requirement for small purchases. The U.S. is implementing the EMV \"chip-and-PIN\" credit card authorization system used overseas. Cards and devices (e.g. iPhones and Apple Watches with Apple Pay) issued abroad with contactless or near-field communication (NFC) capabilities may not work in some merchants where NFC/contactless is used; in such cases, swipe or 'chip-and-pin' will be used. \n Gas station pumps, some public transportation vending machines, and some other types of automated vending machines often have credit/debit card readers. Many of these ask for the ZIP code (i.e., postal code) of the U.S. billing address for the card, which effectively prevents them from accepting foreign cards (they are unable to detect a foreign card and switch to PIN authentication). At gas stations, you can use a foreign-issued card by paying the station attendant inside. If you have a Canadian Mastercard, you can use it at all pumps that require a ZIP code by entering the digits of your postal code (ignoring letters and spaces) and adding two zeroes to the end. When using a debit card, some stations will place a hold on your account for a specified amount (a notice will be present on the pump, typically $75) and then update the charge once you've filled up (but there is often a 1-2 day delay between removing the \"hold\" and updating the amount charged). \n  Sales tax[edit]  There is no federal sales tax (such as VAT or GST), so you cannot claim a tax refund when you leave the U.S. \n Most states have a retail sales tax between 3% and 10%, as do some cities. The goods that are taxed and those that are exempt (often groceries, and pharmaceuticals) vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Restaurant meals are usually taxed. \n Taxes are usually not included in posted prices but are added to your bill, so be prepared for the total to be higher than the listed prices would indicate! \n Some cities have tax zones near airports and business districts that are designed to exploit travellers — sales taxes can vary up to 2% in a matter of a few miles. Regional price variations, however, will usually have more impact on a traveller's wallet than the savings from seeking out a low- or no-sales-tax destination. Some municipalities, such as New York City, also impose a hotel tax on accommodation, which is levied on top of the sales tax. \n  Places for shopping[edit]  See also Shopping in the United States\n  Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota \n \n\n America is the birthplace of the modern enclosed shopping mall and the open-air shopping center. In addition, American suburbs have miles and miles of small strip malls — long rows of small shops with shared parking lots. Large cities have central shopping districts that can be navigated on public transport, but pedestrian-friendly shopping streets are uncommon and usually small. American retail stores are gigantic compared to retail stores in other countries, and have some of the longest business hours in the world, with many chains open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Department stores and other large retailers are usually open from 10AM to 9PM most days, and in November and December, may stay open as long as 8AM to 11PM. Discount stores tend to stay open as late as 10PM or midnight, or may be open 24 hours a day. Most supermarkets are open late into the evening, usually until at least 9PM, and many stay open 24/7. Sunday hours tend to be somewhat shorter, or the stores may close. \n The U.S. pioneered the factory outlet store, in which branded goods are sold for bargain prices, and in turn, the outlet center, a shopping mall consisting primarily of such stores. Outlet centers are found along major Interstate highways outside of most American cities. \n If you see a driveway or yard full of stuff on a summer weekend, it's likely a garage sale (or yard sale), where families sell household items they no longer need. Churches often hold rummage sales, with proceeds generally going to their church or a mission or project they support. \n Flea markets (called \"swap meets\" in Western states) have vendors selling all kinds of usually inexpensive merchandise. Bargaining is expected. \n Thrift stores are retail stores run by churches, charities, and not-for-profit organizations that take in unwanted or un-needed household items as a donation and re-sell them to support projects they are engaged in. \n  Costs[edit]   Bald Eagles in Homer, Alaska \n \n\n The U.S. is generally considered expensive although the cost of living is typically lower than in many other Western countries, whose residents often come to the U.S. to shop. \n A bare-bones budget could be $30–50/day, and you can double that if you stay at motels and eat at cheap cafés. Add on a rental car and hotel accommodation and you'll be looking at $150/day and up. There are regional variations too: large cities like New York and San Francisco are expensive, while prices go down in rural areas. Most U.S. cities have suburbs with good hotels that are often much cheaper than those in the city center. Thus, if you plan to rent a car and drive between several major cities on a single visit to the U.S., it is usually a better idea to stay at safe suburban hotels with free parking, rather than downtown hotels that charge exorbitant parking fees. \n If you intend to visit any United States National Parks, such as the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone National Park, it is worth considering buying a National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass, which gives you access to almost all of the federal parks and recreation areas for one year. \n Many hotels and motels offer discounts for members of certain organizations which anyone can join, such as AAA (the American Automobile Association). If you're a member, or are a member of a club affiliated with AAA (such as the Canadian Automobile Association, the Automobile Association in the UK, or ADAC in Germany), it's worth asking at check-in. Many chain motels/hotels also have frequent customer plans that offer loyalty discounts. \n  Tipping[edit]  Tipping is widely practiced in the United States. Standards vary, but gratuities are always given to servers in restaurants and bars, taxi drivers, parking valets, and bellstaff in hotels. The salaries made in these professions, and even their taxes, take into account that they will be tipped, so it really is inappropriate to leave them out. \n  Thinking about Tipping\n Tipping in many countries is very rare or often not done at all, and unthinkable to some visitors. It is, however, an essential part of your trip to the United States, and you will upset people greatly by refusing to tip or tipping too little, as doing so deprives servers of what is often the main component of their income. A good way to approach this is to treat all prices in a restaurant or other service as having a 20% tax and adjust accordingly — i.e. that $40 meal actually costs $48. \n  Tipping in the United States is so common and expected in some cases that in many service establishments, such as hair salons and restaurants, customers who did not tip are often asked to pay a tip, or in rare cases verbally scolded by staff for \"stiffing\" them. \n While Americans themselves often debate correct levels and exactly who deserves to be tipped, generally accepted standard rates are: \n The legal minimum wage for restaurant waitstaff and other tip-earners is quite low (just $2.13/hour before taxes in some states where minimums for other workers are $7.25 or more). Therefore, tipping for this service is regarded as even more essential. If you receive exceptionally poor or rude service and the manager does not correct the problem when you bring it to their attention, a deliberately small tip (one or two coins) will express your displeasure more clearly than leaving no tip at all (which may be construed as a forgotten tip). \n If paying your bill by cash, leave a cash tip on the table when you leave (there is no need to hand it over personally or wait until it's collected), or if paying by credit card you can add it directly to the charge slip when you sign it. Look carefully, as the slip will generally inform you whether a 15% gratuity has already been added. \n The rules for tipping at fast-food places are different and a bit more complicated. The key thing to remember is that tipping is associated with table service. The procedure at fast-food restaurants and when ordering takeout (even from what is otherwise a sit-down restaurant) is inherently self-service, therefore tipping is not necessary. Some eateries, mostly in the fast-casual sector, have a \"tip jar\" at the checkout station, but tipping in that scenario is purely optional, and you wouldn't be expected to contribute much more than the coins you're handed back as change. At cafeterias and buffets, a small tip is expected since staff often clear the table for you and provide refills of drinks and such. \n The rules for tipping concierges are also arcane. For most services — asking for maps, information, tours, etc. — a tip is not expected. But for things above and beyond like special, unusual, time-consuming requests, if you receive a lot of attention while others are waiting, or even just for an exceptionally high level of service, tips should generally be large, usually starting at $5 (a $1 tip would be insulting). \n Tipping well can make you look good in front of your American friends, dates and business partners, and could even earn you preferential treatment from staff, with the reverse also being true for tipping poorly. \n  Eat[edit]  Main article: American cuisine  Inside a 1950s-style diner, a quintessentially American institution\n \n\n The variety of restaurants throughout the U.S. is remarkable. In a major city such as New York, it may be possible to find a restaurant from nearly every country in the world. In addition to the usual array of independent restaurants, the U.S. possesses a singularly baffling array of fast food and casual chain restaurants; even if you think you know U.S. fast food from the chains' international outlets, the sheer variety domestically is immense. \n Ethnic cuisine from other parts of the world is frequently adapted to American tastes and/or made with locally available ingredients. This is particularly true of Chinese (see below) and other Asian cuisines. \n Many restaurants, especially those serving fast food or breakfast, do not serve alcohol, and many others may only serve beer and wine. Portions are generally huge, regardless of restaurant style, although this trend has moderated as customers are becoming more health-conscious. Many restaurants offer several portion options, though it may not be immediately obvious. Ask when ordering if portion choices are available. Taking home \"leftovers\" is very common and is a good way to get two meals for the price of one. Ask for a to-go box at the end of your meal if you have not cleared your plate. \n In much of America, home-cooked food is as good as or substantially better than typical restaurant fare. This is particularly true in rural areas and small towns. If you have the opportunity to attend a potluck or carry-in dinner, this is a chance not to be missed. \n  Places to eat[edit]  Large cities host many examples of every type of restaurant imaginable from inexpensive neighborhood eateries to extravagant full-service restaurants with extensive wine lists and prices to match. Most medium-sized cities and suburbs will also field a decent selection. In the most upscale restaurants, rules for men to wear jackets and ties, while once de rigueur, are becoming more relaxed. Check with the restaurant if in doubt. \n Takeout food is common in larger cities for meals that may take a little longer to prepare than in a fast-food place. Place an order by phone or online and then go to the restaurant to pick it up and take it away. Many places also offer delivery; in some cities, it is easier to have pizza or Chinese food delivered than to find a sit-down restaurant. Pizza and Chinese are especially ubiquitous for delivery or takeout in the U.S.; towns as small as 5,000 typically have at least one pizza shop and one Chinese takeout/delivery restaurant, and often more than one. Hardcore pizza fans will usually prefer local pizza places to the big national chains; many such restaurants also offer takeout and delivery. \n Fast-casual restaurants offer a fast-food dining style (i.e. no table service), but the meals tend to be fresher and healthier. The food takes a bit longer to prepare — and costs a few dollars more — than at fast food joints, but it's generally worth it. Some fast-casual places even serve alcohol. \n Diners are quintessentially American and have remained popular since their heyday in the 1940s and 50s. They are usually individually run, open 24-hours and found on major roads, though they also appear in large cities and suburbs. They offer a wide variety of huge meals that often include soup or salad, bread, beverage and dessert. They are usually busy for breakfast, in the morning, at the end of factory shifts, or after the bars close. \n No compendium of American restaurants would be complete without mentioning the truck stop. You will only encounter these places if you are taking an intercity auto or bus trip. They are found on the interstate highways and cater to truckers. There will be diesel fuel and separate parking for the \"big rigs\" and showers for the drivers who sleep in their cabs. These fabled restaurants serve what passes on the road for \"plain home cooking\": hot roast beef sandwiches, meatloaf, fried chicken, and of course the ubiquitous club sandwich or burger and fries, served in large portions, often 24 hours a day. \"All you can eat\" buffets and large breakfasts abound. Truckers know their eating: if there are plenty of trucks outside, it'll be good. \n Chain sit-down restaurants have a more predictable level of quality and price compared to local diners and truck stops, although those with discerning palates will probably still be disappointed. Some specialize in a type of food (e.g. seafood, all-day breakfast) or a particular national cuisine, while others have broader offerings. \n For the backpacker or those on very restricted budgets, American supermarkets offer an almost infinite variety of packaged or processed foods that are either ready or almost ready for consumption, including breakfast cereal, ramen noodles, canned soups, and frozen meals. \n In the largest cities, corner stores abound. These small convenience stores carry a variety of snacks, drinks, and packaged foods. Unlike most convenience stores, their products are sold at relatively low prices (especially by urban standards) and can provide snacks or even simple meals for a budget no more than $5 a day. \n  Types of food[edit]   A cheeseburger\n \n\n Popular American food items include hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, ice cream, and pie. While many types of food are unchanged throughout the United States, there are a few distinct regional varieties of food (most notably in the South). \n Fast food restaurants are ubiquitous, but the variety of this type of restaurant in the U.S. is astounding: burgers, hot dogs, pizza, fried chicken, barbecue, TexMex, and ice cream only begin to touch on it. Alcoholic beverages are not served in these restaurants; soft drinks are standard. Don't be surprised when you order a soda, are handed a paper cup and expected to fill it yourself from the soda fountain (refills are often free). The quality of the food varies, but because of the strictly limited menu, it is generally good, especially in the daytime. Also the restaurants are usually clean and bright, and the service is limited but friendly. A few restaurants, called drive-ins, serve you directly in your car. Most fast food places offer drive-thru service, allowing you to place an order from the establishment's menu posted on the side of a dedicated auto lane, and then paying for it and having it handed to you (packaged to go) at a separate side window before driving to your next destination. \n  Rib tips in Memphis \n \n\n At its best, barbecue (often abbreviated \"BBQ\") is pork or beef ribs, beef brisket, or pork shoulder slowly wood-smoked for hours. Ribs are served as a whole- or half-rack or cut into individual ribs, brisket is usually sliced thin, and the shoulder can be shredded (\"pulled\") or chopped. Sauces of varying spiciness may be served on the dish, or provided on the side. There are also unique regional styles of barbecue, with the best generally found in the South. Barbecued meat can be served with a variety of sides, including chili, corn on the cob, coleslaw and potato salad. Barbecue restaurants are unpretentious and the best food is often found at very casual establishments. Expect plastic dinnerware, picnic tables, and sandwiches on cheap white bread. Barbecue found on the menu at a fancy chain or non-specialty restaurant is likely to be less authentic. Ribs and chicken are eaten with your fingers; tackle pork and brisket either with a fork or in a sandwich. Some Americans (though never Southerners) use \"barbecue\" as a synonym for \"cookout\": a party where the likes of chicken, hamburgers, and hot dogs are grilled outdoors (rather than smoked). These can be fun, but are not to be confused with the above. \n With a rich tradition of immigration, America has a wide variety of ethnic foods — everything from Ethiopian cuisine to Laotian food is available in major cities with large immigrant populations — and they're even beginning to cross-pollinate into fusion restaurants, with menus that are a mix of two or more different types of cuisine. \n  These slices of pizza are from New York, but you can get pizza like this in many pizza parlors throughout the Northeast and beyond\n \n\n Italian food is perhaps the most pervasive of ethnic cuisines in America, almost to the point where its \"foreign-ness\" is debatable. While more authentic fare is certainly available in fancier restaurants, Italian food in the U.S. has often taken a different direction than that of Italy itself, especially in terms of pizza, which in the United States is available in a myriad of homegrown styles that are famous regionally and sometimes nationwide, but unknown in Italy. There are also restaurants that specialize in Greek and Middle Eastern cuisines (with feta cheese and hummus fairly widespread on supermarket counters), and in somewhat smaller numbers also German and French restaurants. \n  Sushi is one of the most common Asian dishes in the U.S.\n \n\n Chinese food is widely available and adjusted to American tastes. Authentic Chinese food can be found in restaurants in Chinatowns in addition to communities with large Chinese populations. Japanese sushi, Vietnamese, and Thai food have also been adapted for the American market, with dedicated restaurants in larger towns. Indian and Korean restaurants are also present. \n Also very popular is Latin-American cuisine, especially Mexican, which for many years came almost exclusively in the form of Tex-Mex cuisine: a homegrown hybrid originally developed in Texas but based on an Americanized interpretation of the cuisine of Northern Mexico. Nonetheless, the small authentic Mexican taquerias that were once limited mostly to California and the Southwest have now spread throughout the country. You'll also find Cuban food in South Florida and Puerto Rican and Dominican restaurants in Northeastern coastal cities, both generally serving a more authentic and less Americanized product. \n The Jewish community has given a great deal to the culinary scene. While full-fledged Kosher delis are a dying breed that are nowadays mostly relegated to New York City and other places with exceptionally large Jewish populations, some specialties like bagels and pastrami have entered the culinary mainstream and are now enjoyed nationwide by Americans of all types. Note that most American Jewish cuisine (like most American Jews) are of Ashkenazi extraction; Sephardi and Mizrahi food is largely unknown in the U.S. \n  Dietary restrictions[edit]  Restaurants catering to vegetarians are becoming more common in the U.S. Most big cities and college towns will have restaurants serving exclusively or primarily vegetarian dishes. In smaller towns you may have more of a challenge. Waitstaff can answer questions about menu items, but may consider dishes with beef or pork flavoring, fish, chicken, or egg to be vegetarian. This is especially common with vegetable side dishes in the South. Meat-free breakfast foods such as pancakes or eggs are readily available at diners. Vegan restaurants (and vegan options at other restaurants) are increasingly appearing, especially in large cities. \n People on low-fat or low-calorie diets should be fairly well-served in the U.S. Even fast-food restaurants tend to have a few healthier options on the menu, and can provide charts of calorie and fat counts on request. \n Awareness of food allergies varies. Packaged food must be labeled if it contains milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, or soy. Packaged food must also list its ingredients, although this can include non-specific items like \"spices\", \"seasonings\", or \"added color\". But there is usually no obligation to label allergens in unpackaged food, e.g. in restaurants, bakeries, and fresh food at grocery stores (but laws vary by state). Some restaurants do label allergens, and cater to those with food allergies. Fast food and casual-dining chain restaurants are often a safer bet for people with food allergies as they have consistent ingredients and methods. At sit-down restaurants, inform your waiter, ask questions, and if your waiter is unsure of anything then have them double-check or insist on speaking to a chef. A large selection of gluten-free foods are available, but like other allergens, the labeling laws (must contain less than 20 ppm gluten) apply to packaged food but not restaurants. \n People on religious diets should not have any problems finding what they need in the major cities. Most major cities have at least one halal and kosher butcher, and there are often restaurants serving those respective communities too. The Halal Guys is a uniquely American chain of halal restaurants that operates branches in many major cities. However, such food is often not available at all in small towns and rural areas. \n  Etiquette[edit]  It is usually inappropriate to join a table already occupied by other diners, even if it has unused seats; Americans prefer this degree of privacy when they eat. Exceptions include cafeteria-style eateries with long tables and crowded informal eateries and cafés where you may have success asking a stranger if you can share the table they're sitting at. Striking up a conversation in this situation may or may not be welcome. \n Table manners, though varied, are typically European-influenced. Slurping or making other noises while eating are considered rude, as is loud conversation (including phone calls). It is fairly common to wait until everybody at your table has been served before eating. You should lay cloth napkins across your lap; you can do the same with paper napkins or keep them on the table. \n Many fast food items (sandwiches, burgers, pizza, tacos, etc.) are designed to be eaten by hand; a few foods are almost always eaten by hand (French fries, bacon, barbecue ribs, and many appetizers) even at moderately nice restaurants. If unsure, eating so-called \"finger foods\" with a fork and knife probably won't offend anyone; eating fork-and-knife food by hand might. \n Offense isn't taken if you don't finish your meal; most restaurants will package the remainder to take with you, or provide a box for you to do this yourself (sometimes euphemistically called a \"doggy bag\", implying that the leftovers are for your pet). If you want to do this, ask the server to get the remainder \"to go\"; this will be almost universally understood, and will not cause any embarrassment. Some restaurants offer an \"all-you-can-eat\" buffet or other service; taking home portions from such a meal is either not allowed or carries an additional cost. \n When invited to a meal in a private home, you might ask if you can contribute something to the meal, such as a dessert, a side dish, wine or beer, or for an outdoor cookout, something useful like ice or disposable cups or plates. The host will often decline, especially since you're a traveller. If you aren't asked to contribute to the meal, it is considered good manners to bring along a small gift for the host (often called a hostess gift). A bottle of wine, box of candies or fresh cut flowers are most common. You should not expect your gift, if it's food, to be served with the meal; the host has already selected the meal's components. Gifts of cash or very personal items (e.g. toiletries) are not appropriate. \n An exception is the potluck or carry-in meal, where each guest (or group/family) brings a food dish to share with everyone; these shared dishes make up the entire meal. Usually dishes are grouped (e.g., salads, main dishes or casseroles, side dishes, hors d'oeuvres, desserts); you should ask the host if they want you to bring something in particular. Ideal dishes for a potluck should be served from a large pot, dish, or bowl, and are usually served buffet style—hence the emphasis on salads, casseroles, and bite-sized foods. These types of meals typically offer a wide assortment of well-prepared foods and may be the very best way to experience authentic American cuisine—and your foreign specialty might just be the star attraction! \n  Smoking[edit]  Whether you are allowed to smoke in a bar or restaurant or other public indoor space varies between, and even within, states. In most cases, it is banned. If there is a \"No Smoking\" sign, lighting up may get you ejected, fined, or even arrested, in addition to dirty looks. \n Smoking has acquired a social stigma, even where it is permitted. You may want to ask the people around you whether they mind before lighting up. Many states have laws about smoking near public entrances: keep an eye out for posted signs stating a minimum distance to the door although enforcement is not consistent. Typically, if you find an ash tray or a butt station, you are safe to smoke there. \n As of 2018, some states have legalized recreational and/or medical use of cannabis. In states where cannabis/medical marijuana is legal, a green cross – similar to the logo of the Red Cross, and confusingly similar to the signs for normal pharmacies in other countries – represents a business that sells medical marijuana. Sales in some areas may be limited to local residents or to people with particular medical conditions. Additionally, federal law prohibits handling of cannabis, and transporting cannabis into the country or across state borders, even between states where cannabis is legal, is a crime. It is furthermore unclear how state law (or the jurisdiction of Indian reservations) and federal law collide in terms of cannabis. \n  Drink[edit]   America's native spirit — bourbon, neat\n \n\n Drinking customs in America are as varied as the backgrounds of its many people. In the cities, you can find everything from tough local \"shot and a beer\" bars to upscale \"martini bars\"; urban bars and nightclubs will often serve only simple food, or none at all. In the suburbs, alcohol is mainly served in restaurants rather than bars. And in rural areas, the line between \"bar\" and \"restaurant\" is often blurred to the point of meaninglessness; with few establishments nearby, locals go to the same place for both meals and nightlife. A few states have dry counties, places where it is illegal to sell alcohol for local consumption; these are mostly in rural areas. \n  Laws[edit]   Date confusion\n Some 21-year-olds trying to use a foreign ID to purchase alcohol may be confounded by an unexpected problem: the date is often in the wrong order! \n In most of the world, a birthdate of 12 January 1996 would be written 12-1-1996, using day-month-year order. But the U.S. invariably uses month-day-year order, in which those numbers would be taken to mean December 1, almost a full year later! Unless your ID specifically states that it uses day-month-year format, or uses [English] names for the month as some passports do, it's likely that your ID won't be accepted, as the employee would otherwise be taking you at your word that you're of age to drink. If you want to avoid the problem, get an alternative ID that shows your birthdate in an unambiguous format. \n  The drinking age is 21 throughout the U.S. except in most of the outlying territories (where it is 18). Enforcement of this varies, but always carry a valid picture ID in case you are carded. Generally accepted forms of ID are a U.S. driver's license, state ID or passport. Some bars and retailers require IDs on all transactions, and some may not accept a foreign driver's license (except possibly Canada), so having your passport available when purchasing alcohol is strongly advised. In some states, people who are under 21 cannot even legally enter a bar or liquor store — and even where the law allows it, individual bars might still choose not to admit minors. \n Alcohol sales are typically prohibited after 2AM, though there are some cities where bars are open later or even all night. In some states, most stores can only sell beer and wine; hard liquor is sold at dedicated liquor stores. Several \"dry counties\" – mostly in southern states – ban some or all types of alcohol in public establishments; private clubs (with nominal membership fees) are often set up to get around this. Sunday sales are restricted in some areas. \n Most towns ban drinking in the open with varying degrees of enforcement. Even if it is allowed, a visible bottle (rather than one in a small bag) is either illegal or justifies police attention. Being \"drunk and disorderly\" is illegal. Drunk driving comes under fairly harsh scrutiny. A blood-alcohol level of 0.08% is considered \"under the Influence\" and many states consider a level of 0.05% as \"impaired\". If you're under 21, most states have limits of 0.00-0.02%. American police keep a sharp eye out for drunken drivers (especially on holiday weekends), and have an array of tools at their disposal that can quickly determine if you are under the influence. If you are caught driving under the influence of alcohol, you will almost certainly be arrested. Foreigners will typically be deported, even well-established permanent residents. It is also usually against the law to have an open container of alcohol anywhere in a car other than in the trunk; this can be heavily fined. Should you find yourself in a situation where you drank a bit more than you intended and are unsure if you should drive, taxi cabs are fairly prolific in medium to large cities, and ride-hailing apps have drivers even in small cities. Many automotive clubs offer hotlines to find a ride home. \n  Drinks[edit]  Beer and wine are the main non-distilled alcoholic drinks, with whiskey the main hard liquor (i.e. distilled drink). \"Cider\" without further qualification is just an unfiltered variety of apple juice. Hard cider is the alcoholic drink from fermented apples; although enthusiastically consumed two centuries ago, its popularity is only now resurging after decades of obscurity. \n Beer constitutes approximately half the alcohol consumed in the U.S. Nationally known light lagers (which are cheap and mediocre) remain most prevalent, despite the emergence of other types of beer since the 1990s. Microbreweries, which specialize in small-batch, high-quality beers made by traditional methods, add much-needed variety. Microbrews, also called \"craft beers\", are often inventive and experimental; some are excellent examples of classic beer styles, while others push the limits and develop new, unique flavors. Most are only available locally, but quite a few have reached regional or even national distribution. Some bars and restaurants serve craft beers, while others don't, seemingly at random. Most stores (even convenience stores) carry at least a few, and many have a wide selection. Brew pubs combine microbrewery and bar and serve highly regarded beer that is made on the premises. \n Wine is available across the quality spectrum. American wines are labeled primarily by the grape variety. A rough guide to quality comes in the specificity of the labeling. Color alone (\"Red\", \"white\", and \"rosé\" or \"pink\") denotes the lowest echelon. Above this, regions are labeled by state (e.g. \"California\"), an area of a state (e.g. \"Central Coast\"), a county or other small region (e.g. \"Willamette Valley\"), or a specific vineyard (e.g. \"Dry Creek Vineyard\"). \n The cheapest wine tends to come in a plastic bag encased in a box. \"Fortified wines\", known as \"bum wine\", are the precise opposite of high-class European port, sherry or Madeira. \n All 50 states practice some sort of winemaking, though 90% of America's wine—including its most highly regarded from the Napa Valley—are Californian. Wines from Oregon's Willamette Valley and Washington state represent good value as they are less well known. Michigan, Colorado's Wine Country, and New York State's Finger Lakes produce German-style whites which have won international competitions. The Llano Estacado region of Texas is also notable for its wines. \n Sparkling wines are available by the bottle in upscale restaurants, and are also sometimes served by the glass. The best Californian sparkling wines have been rated comparably to leading French champagnes but they are not commonly sold in supermarkets outside of California. \n Sparkling cider is usually a non-alcoholic drink that comes in the shape of a champagne bottle and can be flavored. Hard Ciders are those that contain alcohol in them. \n Most bars, except urbane wine bars, serve unremarkable wine. Wine is taken quite seriously by some restaurants, but as with all other alcoholic drinks in restaurants, expect to pay up to four times the liquor store price for a bottle. \n Hard alcohol (i.e. spirits) is usually drunk with mixers, but it is also served \"on the rocks\" (with ice) or \"straight\" (unmixed, with no ice, also called \"neat\"). Whiskey, the traditional choice, remains popular despite the increased popularity of vodka and other clear spirits. Whiskey is distilled from many different grains. The main types are rye, malt (made with mainly barley) and bourbon (made with mainly corn, i.e. maize). \n  Nightlife[edit]   The bright lights of Sin City, Las Vegas, Nevada \n \n\n Nightclubs in America run the usual gamut of various music scenes, from discos with top-40 dance tunes to obscure clubs serving tiny slices of obscure musical genres. Country music dance clubs, or honky tonks, are laid fairly thick in the South and West, especially in rural areas and away from the coasts, but one or two can be found in almost any city. Also, gay/lesbian nightclubs exist in nearly every medium- to large-sized city. \n \"Happy hour\", a period usually lasting from 30 minutes to three hours, usually between 5PM and 8PM, sees significant discounts on selected drinks. \"Ladies' nights\", during which women receive a discount, are increasingly common. \n Until 1977, the only U.S. state with legalized gambling was Nevada. The state has allowed games of chance since the 1930s, creating such resort cities as Las Vegas and Reno in the process. Dubbed \"Sin City,\" Las Vegas in particular has evolved into an end-destination adult playground, offering many other after-hours activities such as amusement parks, night clubs, strip clubs, shows, bars and four star restaurants. Gambling has since spread outside of Nevada to a plethora of U.S. cities like Atlantic City, New Jersey and Biloxi, Mississippi, as well as to riverboats, offshore cruises and Indian reservations. State lotteries and \"scratch games\" are another, popular form of legalized gambling. However, online gaming and wagering on sports across state lines remains illegal in the U.S. \n  Non-alcoholic beverages[edit]  The United States has a wide variety of soft drinks with some of the most famous brands originating here. While Pepsi and Coca-Cola are sold around the world, some flavors are hardly known outside North America. Sparkling water, once seen as a European curiosity, has become increasingly popular as a healthier alternative to sugary soft drinks and is now available in most stores. Tap water is usually served for free at restaurants, and in most parts of the country other than the New York City area, you will generally get free refills of coffee, tea, and (somewhat less often) soft drinks. Americans like to put a lot of ice into their drinks, so unless you specifically request otherwise, expect any non-alcoholic drink you order in a restaurant (including water) to contain a large quantity of ice cubes. When ordering water at fast food restaurants, bottled water may be assumed if you don't specify tap water. \n  Sleep[edit]   Classic 1950s motel in Seligman, Arizona, along Route 66 \n \n\n By far the most common form of lodging in rural United States and along many Interstates is the motel. Providing inexpensive rooms to automotive travelers, most motels are clean and reasonable with a limited array of amenities: telephone, TV, bed, bathroom. Motel 6 (☏+1-800-466-8356) is a national chain with reasonable rates ($30–70, depending on the city). Super 8 Motels (☏+1-800-800-8000) provide reasonable accommodations throughout the country as well. Reservations are typically unnecessary, which is convenient since you don't have to arbitrarily interrupt a long road trip; you can simply drive until you're tired then find a room. Often they will also light up their sign outside to tell if there is vacancy, in which case you can simply walk in if they have one. However, some are used by adults looking to book a night for sex or illicit activities and many are located in undesirable areas. \n Business or extended-stay hotels are increasingly available across the country. They can be found in smaller towns across the Midwest or in coastal urban areas. Generally they are more expensive than motels, but not as expensive as full-scale hotels, with prices around $70 to $170. While the hotels may appear to be the size of a motel, they may offer amenities from larger hotels. \n Some extended-stay hotels are directed at business travelers or families on long-term stays (that are often relocating due to corporate decisions). These hotels often feature kitchens in most rooms, afternoon social events (generally by a pool), and serve continental breakfast. Such \"suite\" hotels are roughly equivalent to the serviced apartments seen in other countries, though the term is not generally used in American English. \n Hotels are available in most cities and usually offer more services and amenities than motels. Rooms usually run about $80–300 per night, but very large, glamorous, and expensive hotels can be found in most major cities, offering luxury suites larger than some houses. Check-in and check-out times are almost always fall in the range of 11AM-noon and 2PM-4PM, respectively. Some hotels in the U.S. will not take people under the age of 21 if not checking in with older adults. Many U.S. cities now have \"edge cities\" in their suburbs which feature high-quality upscale hotels aimed at affluent business travelers. These hotels often feature all the amenities of their downtown/CBD cousins (and more), but at less exorbitant prices. A minority of hotels are dog-friendly, with even fewer allowing other types of pets; either way you'll likely need to pay a surcharge and a refundable damage deposit. Amenities such as wi-fi and breakfast are usually free in mid-range hotels, but often not available at all in the cheapest motels, and only available for exorbitant prices in luxury hotels. \n  Many bed &amp; breakfasts are in old, antique or historic houses\n \n\n In many rural areas bed and breakfast (B&amp;B) lodging can be found that are usually in converted houses. B&amp;Bs feature a more home-like lodging experience, with free breakfast served. Bed and breakfasts range from about $50 to $200 per night and can be a nice break from the impersonality of chain hotels and motels. Unlike Europe, most American bed and breakfasts are unmarked. \n The two best-known hotel guides covering the U.S. are the AAA (formerly American Automobile Association; typically pronounced \"Triple-A\") TourBooks, available to members and affiliated auto clubs worldwide at local AAA offices; and the Mobil Travel Guide, available at bookstores. There are several websites booking hotels online; be aware that many of these sites add a small commission to the room rate, so it may be cheaper to book directly through the hotel. On the other hand, some hotels charge more for \"drop-in\" business than reserved rooms or rooms acquired through agents and brokers, so it's worth checking both. \n Youth hostels haven't really taken off in the U.S., but they exist across the country. Some are affiliated with the American Youth Hostel organization (a Hostelling International member). Quality of hostels varies widely, but at $8–$24 per night, the prices are unbeatable. Despite the name, AYH membership is open to people of any age. Non-AYH hostels are also available, particularly in larger cities. Hostels are clustered in more touristy locations: do not assume that all mid-sized cities will have a hostel, and even very big cities may only have one or two. \n Camping can also be an affordable lodging option, especially with good weather. The downside is that most campgrounds are outside urban regions, so it's not much of an option for trips to big cities. There is a huge network of National Parks (☏+1-800-365-2267), with most states and many counties having their own park systems, too. Most state and national campgrounds are of excellent quality, with beautiful natural environments. Expect to pay $7–$20 per car on entry. Kampgrounds of America (KOA) has a chain of commercial campground franchises across the country, of significantly less charm than their public-sector equivalents, but with hookups for recreational vehicles and amenities such as laundromats. Countless independently owned private campgrounds vary in character. \n Some unusual lodging options are available in specific areas or by prior arrangement. For example, you might enjoy staying on a houseboat in Lake Tahoe or the Erie Canal. Or stay in a treehouse in Oregon. More conventional lodging can be found at college or university dormitories, a few of which rent out rooms to travelers during the summertime. Finally, in many tourist areas, as well as big cities, you can rent a furnished house by the day. \n  Learn[edit]   Main article: Studying in the United States See also: Touring prestigious and notable universities in the U.S.  Studying full-time in the United States is an excellent opportunity for young adults seeking an advanced education, a chance to see a foreign country, and a better understanding of the U.S. and its people. It can be done independently by applying directly to a college for admission, or through the \"study abroad\" or \"foreign exchange\" department of a college in your own country, usually for a single term or one year. The latter is usually easiest; the two institutions will handle much of the arrangements, and you don't have to make a commitment to four years living in a strange country. The U.S. is home to many of the world's most prestigious universities and attracts more international students than any other country in the world, and a lot of cultural diversity can be seen throughout its top universities. \n  Work[edit]  Main article: Working in the United States The United States, as the biggest economy in the world, entices foreigners with employment opportunities across the full range of skill levels and economic sectors. Like other countries, though, the U.S. has adopted immigration and visa laws designed to give preference to U.S. residents. Make sure you understand what legal barriers you face to getting a job in the U.S. Do not attempt to work illegally in the U.S., as you could potentially be subject to arrest, deportation, and a ban on re-entry. Illegal workers also run the risk of unsafe work conditions. \n  Stay safe[edit]   Crime[edit]  Headline-grabbing major crimes give the U.S. a reputation for crime, but few visitors experience any problems; common-sense precautions and staying alert are generally sufficient to avoid trouble. Crime is usually connected with gangs and drugs in the inner cities, and with heated disputes. Avoid those and you'll be fine. Urban tourist areas are heavily policed and are safe from all but petty crimes. \n Rural crime in America tends to be very rare and very local, occurring primarily in very poor, troubled communities which are easy to avoid. Urban areas tend to have homeless people who may aggressively ask for money. If you feel harassed, say \"No\" firmly and walk away. \n Crime rates (including murder rates) are significantly higher in the U.S. than in most of Europe and East Asia, but lower than in most of the rest of the world. However, those rates are somewhat distorted by gang violence and other organized crime that is almost exclusively contained within certain impoverished neighborhoods and members of organized crime groups targeting one another - all things that are unlikely to affect the vast majority of travelers. \n Illegal immigration and drug smuggling, and the authorities' heavy-handed treatment of them, make the Mexican border undesirable to visit. Official border crossings are safe to use. \n There has been a reported increase in mass shootings and white nationalist terrorism since 2016, albeit against the backdrop of a declining number of homicide deaths overall. While these occur in random locations that are nearly impossible to predict, as a tourist, your chances of encountering one are slim. \n  Police[edit]   Officers of the Los Angeles Police in a patrol car\n \n\n American police are generally polite, professional, and honest. When in uniform, they are also more formal, cautious, cold and sometimes aggressive than police in, say, Europe or Latin America—especially in large cities. You should expect that police will draw and use their weapons much faster and with more deadly force than police forces in other Western countries. If stopped by police, you should stay calm, be polite and cooperative, avoid making sudden movements, and state what you are doing if you need to reach for your purse or wallet to present your identification. It is particularly important for you to appear calm and cooperative if you are a person of color, since non-white people are much more likely to be subject to police harassment. Turn on the inside car lights and keep your hands on the wheel to make it clear that you are not a threat; do not exit the vehicle unless told to do so. Generally the driver of the car should speak to the officer when they approach. \n Do not offer bribes to a police officer under any circumstances. U.S. police culture categorically rejects bribes, and even the mere suggestion can result in your immediate arrest. If you need to pay a fine, don't try to pay the officer; he or she can direct you to the appropriate police station, courthouse, or government office. Most minor traffic infractions can be paid by mail. Increasingly fines can be paid online or over the phone within a matter of minutes of receiving the ticket, though often for a convenience fee of a few dollars. Instructions are often printed on the ticket. Unlike in much of the world, fines are not tied to income and can be rather steep as many towns and counties—controversially—rely on them as a major source of revenue. You should thus be especially careful to comply with the less obvious rules. \n There are three types of police you are most likely to encounter: state police or highway patrol units on major highways, deputy sheriffs employed by county governments in rural areas, and police officers employed by city or town governments in urban areas. There are also smaller police departments, like transit or airport police which patrol public transportation, and university or campus police which patrol universities. Federal law enforcement officers are generally found only in or near federal facilities, such as ports of entry, national parks, and government offices. If you encounter them elsewhere, it is usually because they are investigating specific allegations of federal crimes. \n  Emergency services[edit]  Dialing 911 at any telephone will reach the emergency services (police, fire, ambulance, etc.). Any U.S. phone, regardless if it is \"active\" or not, must be able to dial 911 if it is connected to the network, and such calls are always free. Unless you are calling from a mobile or Internet-based phone, the operator should be able to locate you from the phone you are using even if you do not say anything. Modern cell phones will send a GPS fix of your location down to a few meters within a few seconds of dialing 911. Dialing 911 and leaving an open line will bring all 3 emergency services to your location in under 5 minutes in most populated areas. Response time may be longer in sparsely populated areas or along the Interstates. \n On any GSM mobile phone (the standard technology in most of the world, especially in Europe), you can also dial 112, which is the standard emergency number for GSM networks worldwide. U.S. GSM carriers (AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and smaller regional operators) automatically redirect 112 calls to 911. \n  Border Patrol[edit]  The United States Border Patrol works near both the Canadian and the Mexican borders, as well as in Southern coastal areas like the Florida Keys. They can verify immigration status and enforce immigration laws in the \"border zones\"—generally within 40 miles of Canada and 75 miles of Mexico (although the law allows for 100 miles from any border, including sea and the Great Lakes). Near Canada they tend to be unobtrusive and generally focus their work on long-distance buses and trains. Near the southern border, systematic vehicle checkpoints or being stopped on the street with a friendly \"Papers, please...\" is much more likely. They tend not to target tourists specifically. \n Foreigners are always required to carry their passports, visas, and landing cards (or Green Cards). Being found without them near the border could lead you to being detained until your status is verified, or possibly fined. If your documents are in order, you generally won't be questioned. In most states (Arizona is a notable exception), police and other local authorities are not allowed to question you about your immigration status or to ask to see your passport or visa unless you're arrested and charged with a crime, and then only for the purpose of connecting you with your embassy. As a result of the 9/11 attacks, some statistics have shown that Muslims or those who are assumed to be Muslims may be disproportionately targeted for additional screenings at airports despite claims that passengers are chosen at random. \n  Natural disasters[edit]   Tornadoes are more common in the United States than in any other country\n \n\n The U.S. is a huge country with very varied geography, and parts of it are occasionally affected by natural disasters: hurricanes and tropical storms from June through November in the South and along the East Coast, blizzards in New England, near the Great Lakes, and in the Rocky Mountains, tornadoes mostly in the Great Plains and Midwest, earthquakes on the West Coast and in Alaska, floods in areas of the Midwest and wildfires in the late summer and early fall in Texas and on the West Coast, particularly California. See the regions in question for more details. \n Because tornadoes are so common between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains, this area has earned itself the colloquial name Tornado Alley. Hawaii contains several active volcanoes, but they are not usually a threat to life and limb. The last high profile eruption in the mainland U.S. was that of Mount Saint Helens in 1980. \n In the case of a natural disaster, local, state or federal authorities can issue a warning over the Emergency Alert System. It has a very distinctive electronic screeching followed by a sound similar to a dial tone prior to any message. It will override AM/FM radio broadcasts as well as TV systems. Smartphones sold since about 2011 will often receive an alert message based on the current location of the phone (depending on the phone's settings, this may include a loud alert tone). Coast Guard weather is broadcast continuously on VHF marine radio for seafarers; a separate system (seven frequencies around 161 MHz) provides conditions ashore. Special \"weather radios\" are able to monitor the frequency, even in standby mode, and sound the alarm if deadly storms (such as tornadoes or hurricanes) are brewing. In most tornado-prone regions, a system of sirens will sound when a tornado warning is issued. If you hear the siren, seek shelter immediately. (For more information, see tornado safety.) \n  Gay and lesbian[edit]    Castro Street pedestrian crosswalk with Rainbow Flag Colors\n \n\n In general, the U.S. is a safe destination for gay and lesbian travelers, though as a whole, homosexuality is not quite as well accepted as in Australia, New Zealand, Canada or Western Europe. Most Americans take a live-and-let-live approach to sexuality, but there are significant exceptions. It's generally not a problem to be open about your sexual orientation, though you may receive unwanted attention or remarks in some situations. Attitudes toward homosexuality vary widely even in regions with a reputation for tolerance or intolerance. Acceptance is most common in major cities throughout the country and smaller cities, suburbs and college towns especially around the Pacific Coast, the Northeast and Hawaii, with acceptance in these areas generally being on par with Western Europe. Homophobia and anti-gay violence may be encountered anywhere, especially in some suburban and rural areas, but the chances of this happening to you are low. \n The 6-color rainbow flag or gay pride flag is widely known even outside the gay community, and is very commonly used by individuals and by gay-friendly businesses. Other symbols (such as the pink triangle, or specific flags for bisexual or transgender people) exist but are much less common. \n Gay-friendly destinations, where openly gay couples are common, include New York's Chelsea, Rochester in Western New York State, Austin,Chicago's Boystown, Seattle's Capitol Hill, San Francisco's Castro Street, Washington's Dupont Circle, Miami Beach's South Beach, Atlanta's Midtown and Los Angeles' West Hollywood. Even outside of gay neighborhoods, many major cities are gay-friendly, especially in the Northeast and the West Coast. An increasing number of resort areas are known as gay-friendly, including Fire Island, Key West, Asheville, Provincetown, Ogunquit, Rehoboth Beach, Saugatuck, and Asbury Park. In other smaller cities, there are neighborhoods where gay people tend to congregate, and many have resource centers for LGBT people. \n If you're married to someone of the same sex, you may encounter some difficulties in more conservative areas of the country, but Supreme Court rulings have made it clear that no municipal, state or federal authority is allowed to treat same-sex relationships differently from opposite-sex ones. In most jurisdictions, individual businesses remain free to refuse service to gays and lesbians; fewer than twenty states list sexual orientation as a protected category (like race and gender) and fewer still extend these protections to transgender persons. While transgender persons are not prohibited from travel, some have reported undue scrutiny at U.S. airport security checkpoints. A few large cities have enacted local anti-discrimination ordinances and some businesses specifically advertise that they are LGBT-friendly by displaying symbols (typically a rainbow flag) on their storefronts. A few large cities have alternative monthly or weekly publications which provide news and lists of venues or events specifically for the LGBT communities; national LGBT publications include Out magazine and The Advocate. \n Men planning to engage in any sexual activity should be aware of the heightened risk of HIV and other infections in the United States. A gay American man is 44 times more likely to contract HIV than a heterosexual one, and 46 times more likely to contract syphilis. This risk grows greatly among men likely to engage in one-night stands and other higher-risk behavior. In a nation where 0.5% of the population are infected with HIV, unprotected sex is a very real risk. Precautions, including using protection, are strongly advised during your stay. Most cities have affordable or free testing and treatment centers for STIs, though hours may be limited and waits may be long. Planned Parenthood clinics are often an affordable alternative. Seeking health care elsewhere can be very pricey. \n  Drugs[edit]  In general U.S. drug laws can be pretty severe: even possession or transportation of small amounts can lead to prison or deportation and should be avoided by travelers. However, laws and attitudes concerning the most commonly available drug, marijuana, vary wildly from state to state. States like Louisiana and Florida impose large fines and lengthy prison sentences, while in other states marijuana use has been largely decriminalized. 18 states allow medical use of marijuana, where persons can obtain marijuana for medicinal use with a doctor's prescription and a \"medical marijuana card\". In some states, particularly cities on the West Coast, medical marijuana dispensaries are so commonplace that they seem almost ordinary. Colorado, Washington state, Oregon, California and Alaska allow limited recreational use of marijuana, as does the District of Columbia, although the status of legalization there is in doubt due to the District's unique Federal status. Under no circumstances should you transport marijuana or other drugs that are illegal under federal law across state lines, onto (some) Indian reservations, onto federal lands (such as federal office buildings, military bases, and post offices) or internationally as doing so is drug trafficking and could subject you to a lengthy prison term. Even if transporting on a direct flight or through the mail between places where marijuana is legal or tolerated such as between the U.S. and the Netherlands, between Washington state and Colorado, or even within a state where marijuana is legal (eg. in California), it is still illegal under U.S. federal law. \n    Note: You can be turned away from the U.S. border if you are carrying any substance prohibited by U.S. federal laws, including marijuana. You can also be turned away from the U.S. border if you are employed in the cannabis industry where this is a legal activity. You can be banned from entering the U.S. for life if you lie to a customs official. Actually crossing the U.S. border with any quantity of cannabis in any form is a federal offense.  \n  Prostitution[edit]  Prostitution is illegal except at licensed brothels in rural Nevada. Tolerance varies considerably between states. Police officers occasionally pose as prostitutes to catch and arrest anyone offering to pay for sex. \n  Guns[edit]   \"No recreational shooting\", Roxborough State Park, Colorado \n \n\n It's true: the U.S. has a strong gun culture, and many (but by no means all) Americans own a firearm. Possession of firearms is regulated by individual states, and while these regulations (obtaining necessary permits, the kinds of arms permitted) vary greatly from state to state and, sometimes, from city to city within the same state, the U.S. is generally considered to be a place with lenient attitudes towards firearm ownership, especially compared to Europe and Asia. \n Although U.S. citizens have a constitutionally guaranteed right to own and carry firearms, non-immigrant aliens present in America for fewer than 180 days cannot legally possess a firearm or ammunition, unless they travelled specifically for hunting or sport shooting, or they have a valid hunting license from the state they are shooting in. Entry in a recognized shooting competition also qualifies. Anything else is strictly illegal. \n Warning: People who have renounced U.S. citizenship are not allowed to possess firearms or ammunition, even for sporting purposes. \n Your chances of getting shot are very low, but bear in mind that: \n  Racism[edit]  Compared to many European and Asian countries, the U.S. is, at least publicly, a racially tolerant country. The U.S. Constitution, coupled with both state and federal legislation and case law, prohibits racial discrimination in a range of public spheres such as employment, university admissions and receiving services from retail businesses. However, the Constitution also guarantees freedom of speech to a greater degree than in most other Western democracies, so it is unfortunately possible to encounter racist comments (both blatant and subtle) in public forums. \n Still, most Americans are, or at least profess to be, tolerant of other races, and it is rare to face open aggression from random people solely as a result of one's race. The country goes through occasional periods of increased animosity toward racial minorities or immigrants, but the longer-term trend has been one of increasing tolerance and acceptance. \n  Stay healthy[edit]  Tap water is potable, but sometimes avoided due to the taste imparted by the chlorine used to purify it. It's of good quality in many places, including New York City; however, it tastes bad in certain low-rainfall areas, such as Santa Barbara, so you might prefer to drink bottled water or seltzer in those places. Bottled water is near ubiquitous and available for a variety of prices. Quality tends to be high and the chemical difference between a 50 cent bottle of water and a 5 dollar bottle of water is oftentimes negligible. Lead plumbing is still a problem in some places, as became evident in the high profile case of Flint, Michigan, but hotels and public water dispensers are unlikely to be affected. \n  Disease[edit]  Being a highly industrialized nation, the United States is largely free from most serious communicable diseases found in many developing nations; however, the HIV rate is higher than in Canada and Western Europe, with about a 0.5% infection rate in the overall population. \n For the latest in traveler's health information pertaining to the United States, including advisories and recommendations, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for health information for travellers to the United States. \n There are two infectious diseases that are worth becoming educated about: \n Other diseases that are endemic within the United States, but are of far less concern, include Hantaviral Pulmonary Syndrome (found in western regions), Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (mostly in the Rocky Mountain region), West Nile Virus (all regions) and Eastern/Western Equine Encephalitis (particularly in the Midwest). \n Due to the high amount of travel and the fact that diaspora communities from almost every country in the world have some presence here., the U.S. is somewhat more likely than other places to have \"imported\" cases of pandemics, as seen in the case of the Ebola epidemic of 2014. Again this is unlikely to be of concern to you. \n  Health care[edit]  American health care is generally first-class, but very expensive. Make sure that your travel insurance is valid for the U.S. Given the high costs, some \"world-wide\" insurance specifically does not cover the U.S. But if you can afford it, the U.S. is by far the world's leading nation in medical research, and you have at your disposal the most cutting edge treatments that are often not available anywhere else. Long-term visitors to the U.S. (e.g., work or student visa holders) are generally required to take up private health insurance as part of their visa conditions. If you are planning to work in the U.S., check with your employer to see if health insurance is provided as part of your employee benefits. \n To the patient, America's public (20%), private for-profit (20%), and private not-for-profit (60%) hospitals are generally indistinguishable. Inner city public hospitals may be more crowded and less well maintained, but as a whole both costs and service levels are consistently high in all types. No hospital can refuse a life-threatening emergency case. Private hospitals may only stabilize such patients before sending them to a nearby public hospital, which will generally act as the regional center for 24-hour emergency treatment. \n  Ambulance in Pittsburgh \n \n\n In a life-threatening emergency, call 911 to summon an ambulance to take you to the nearest hospital emergency room (\"ER\"), or in less urgent situations get to the hospital yourself and register at the ER's front desk. Ambulance fees typically range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, and though they will never refuse to transport you in an emergency, the ambulance fees will be billed to you at a later date. Emergency rooms treat patients regardless of their ability to pay, even though their services are not free. Expect to pay at least $500 for a visit, plus the cost of any specific services or medications you are given. Avoid using ERs for non-emergency walk-in care; they are 3–4 times more expensive than other options and your non-urgent condition means you will have a wait of hours or maybe days. Most urban areas also have minor emergency centers (also called \"urgent care\", etc.) for conditions that don't require a visit to the emergency room (e.g. superficial lacerations). Their hours may be limited; few are open at night. \n Walk-in clinics can provide routine medical care; to find one, check the yellow pages (see By phone below) under \"Clinics\", or call a major hospital and ask. Patients see a doctor or nurse practitioner without an appointment (but often with a bit of a wait). They are typically very up-front about fees, and always accept credit cards. Make sure the clerk knows you will be paying \"out of pocket\"; if they assume an insurance company is paying, they may inflate the bill with unnecessary extras. \n Dentists are accustomed to explaining fees over the phone, and most will accept credit cards. Health insurance typically does not provide dental coverage; you will need to take up separate dental insurance for that. \n Government-supported clinics offering free or low-cost testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases are widespread. Local Health Departments will provide more details. Planned Parenthood (1-800-230-7526) is a private agency with clinics and centers around the country providing birth control and other reproductive health services. \n Note the difference between a red cross and a green cross: in the United States, anything medically related will have a red cross, whereas medical marijuana dispensaries will have a green cross. \n  Cope[edit]   Religious services[edit]  Christian visitors looking to attend religious services should have no problem locating a house of worship, even in small towns. A typical medium-sized American town or city probably has one or more Catholic parishes, several Protestant churches (the most common being Baptist, Pentecostal, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Methodist and Episcopal/Anglican), and possibly other houses of worship depending on the demographics of the area (such as synagogues or mosques). \n Most churches in the United States practice an \"open table\", meaning they welcome you to participate in worship, and some or all rituals, even if you're not a member of their religious denomination. Some churches, and some entire denominations, welcome LGBT individuals. \n Some churches also have after-church luncheon for free or at a nominal cost. Visitors are always welcome to stay for lunch and fellowship as a way to meet locals. \n  News and media[edit]  Though it's not as ubiquitous as before the advent of the Internet, print media isn't dead yet. Just about every mid-sized city (and many small ones) has a daily newspaper covering local news and often some national news. Major metropolitan areas will usually have more than one paper to choose from. With a few exceptions (mostly tabloids like the New York Post and New York Daily News), most papers provide reasonably balanced coverage of hard news, with their political biases manifesting themselves only in their editorial or opinion sections. \n The national paper of record is The New York Times ($2.50 daily, $6 Sunday); its coverage of national and international issues makes it daily reading just about anywhere in the country. For financial news, The Wall Street Journal (also based in NYC, $2) is similarly well-respected and widely read. For a more casual but still informative format, USA Today ($2) is published five days a week; it's the most widely circulated print newspaper in the country. Many hotels offer free copies of either the local paper or USA Today; ask at the front desk. Other widely read papers include the Los Angeles Times (known for its West Coast coverage) and The Washington Post (with exemplary political reporting from the nation's capital). Time and Newsweek are newsmagazines published weekly that offers more in-depth feature coverage. \n Major metropolitan areas also have a full suite of broadcast television stations; small cities might have only two or three local stations, especially if they're within broadcast range of a larger city. The major broadcast networks are ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, and PBS (taxpayer-subsidized public broadcasting); each has local stations in each market that broadcast local and national news, syndicated shows, and in-house TV series. Almost the entire country is wired for cable TV. That opens up a whole range of options for viewing, from CNN for news to The Weather Channel to ESPN for sports, along with countless entertainment channels. \n Broadcast radio is a much more fragmented market than television; major cities have dozens of stations on both AM and FM bands. The AM band is mostly used for talk formats; music stations are almost exclusively found on the FM band. Many rental cars come equipped with satellite radio from SiriusXM, which offers hundreds of channels of music, comedy, news, talk, and sports, without the need to keep finding new stations as you drive across the country. \n  Respect[edit]    Burning Man, Nevada \n \n\n The United States is a very diverse country, meaning that cultural norms can vary significantly from region to region, and it is difficult to generalize what could be offensive and what could not. For instance, while making homophobic statements would be very offensive in a liberal area like New York City, the opposite could be true in a strongly Evangelical rural town in the South. \n Also see the section on tipping, and the section on smoking. \n  Dress[edit]  Dress in the U.S. tends to be fairly casual. For everyday clothes, jeans and T-shirts are always acceptable, as are shorts when the weather is suitable. Sneakers (athletic shoes) are common; flip-flops and sandals are also popular in warm weather. In the winter seasons in northern states boots are commonly worn. \n In general, dress code is a bit more formal in the metropolises of the Atlantic, and in the South (where \"Southern style\" is a surviving concept), and more relaxed the further west you go. \n Generally, Americans accept religious attire such as yarmulkes, hijabs and burqas without comment. \n At the workplace, business casual (slacks, understated collared shirts without a tie, and non-athletic shoes) is now the default at many companies. More traditional industries (e.g. finance, legal, and insurance) still require suits and ties. Other industries (e.g. computer software) are even more casual, allowing jeans and even shorts for everyday wear; as a business visitor, a safe choice would be business casual, or jeans and a collared shirt. \n When dressing up for nice restaurants or upscale entertainment, a pair of nice slacks, a collared shirt, and dress shoes will work almost everywhere. Ties for men are rarely necessary, but jackets are occasionally required for very upscale restaurants in big cities (such restaurants will almost always have jackets to lend). \n At the beach or pool, men prefer loose bathing trunks or boardshorts, and women wear bikinis or one-piece swimsuits. Nude bathing is not generally acceptable and is usually illegal except at certain private beaches or resorts; even women going topless is not usually accepted by most people, and is also illegal in some states. \n Breastfeeding in public can be a touchy subject. While most mothers in the U.S. do breastfeed at home for at least a little while, a woman doing so in public, whether covered or not, can elicit complaints about indecent exposure, often from other mothers. All states/territories except Idaho and Puerto Rico have laws explicitly allowing women to breastfeed in public, and 29 states plus D.C. and the Virgin Islands also exempt breastfeeding from prosecution for public indecency or indecent exposure; some businesses have also changed their policies in the last few years to allow and protect breastfeeding mothers. However, public attitudes vary, and a mother breastfeeding in public, particularly uncovered, may receive some unwanted stares and in rare cases negative comments. \n  Connect[edit]   By phone[edit]   Phone charging station at Newark airport \n \n\n  Domestic calls[edit]  The country code for the U.S. is +1. The long-distance prefix (trunk code) is also \"1\", so U.S. telephone numbers are frequently written as an eleven-digit number: \"1-nnn-nnn-nnnn\". The rest of the telephone number consists of ten digits: a three-digit area code, and a seven-digit number. There can be many area codes in large cities, and only one or two for the entirety of a mostly rural state. The area code does not indicate whether a number is a mobile or a landline. Also, many Americans do not change their numbers when they move, so the area code of their mobile number may not match landlines in the region. \n From a mobile phone, a domestic call is simple: always dial ten digits without the \"1\". \n From a fixed line, you can usually dial a local number using ten digits. New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco require eleven digits. Regions with only one area code usually allow seven digits. If a number is written or given without the area code, you can usually dial it like that locally, but dialing ten digits also works. For long-distance and toll-free, always dial eleven digits. \n Domestic calls to area codes 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844 and 833 are toll-free. From a fixed line, they must be dialed using the full 11-digit pattern. With few exceptions (such as Canada or, rarely, Mexico) these are not reachable from abroad. (VoIP and Skype users may be able to circumvent this restriction by calling via a U.S.-based gateway.) \n  International calls[edit]  To dial abroad from the U.S., the international access code is 011. On a mobile phone, \"+\" will also work. \n Canada, U.S. territories, Bermuda, and 17 Caribbean nations are part of the North American Numbering Plan, and have the same +1 country code as the U.S. Calls made between these countries are dialed using only the full 11-digit number, without the \"011\" or \"+\" access code, but almost all are charged at international rates. Calls between the U.S. and its territories may be more expensive than calls within the contiguous 48 states and D.C., or even calls between the U.S. mainland and Canada (which are typically charged at a higher rate than domestic calls, but lower than other international calls). Alaska and Hawaii may carry a surcharge even for domestic calls, depending on the carrier and rate plan. \n  Phones and directories[edit]  Pay phones can be hard to find. Likely locations include in or near stores and restaurants, shopping mall entrances and near bus stops. Most are coin operated (quarters, dimes and nickels) and do not accept banknotes. Prices are normally $0.50 for the first three minutes, and $0.25 for each additional minute. An online directory of pay phones can be found at Pay Phone Directory. Calls to 911 (to report an emergency) and to toll-free area codes (800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844 and 833) are free from pay phones. A few commercial toll-free numbers block inbound calls from U.S. payphones. \n Telephone directories are often split into two books: the white pages list phone numbers alphabetically by last name, and the yellow pages list businesses by category (e.g. \"Taxicabs\"). Many residential land-line phones and all mobile phones are unlisted. Directory assistance can be had (at an extra cost) by dialing 411 (for local numbers) or 1-[area code]-555-1212 (for other areas). If 411 doesn't work, try 555-1212, [area code]-555-1212 or 1-[area code]-555-1212. Free directory information (with advertisements) is available: dial 1-800-FREE-411 (1-800-3733-411) or browse free411.com or 411.info. Regional telephone companies' web sites (most often AT&amp;T, Verizon, or CenturyLink) also provide directory information. Using the website of the company that operates in the region you are interested in yields the best results. \n Long-distance telephone calling cards are available at most convenience stores. They are generally aimed at specific types of call (e.g. domestic, or to particular countries). Credit can often be replenished over the phone using a credit or debit card, but foreign bank cards may be refused. Card calls from payphones via toll-free numbers printed on the cards may be more expensive. There may also be effective charges per connection as well as per minute; some cards also carry hidden weekly or monthly charges which deplete their value. \n  Mobile phones[edit]  The four largest mobile phone networks in the U.S. are AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, and T-Mobile. These all have good coverage of practically all urban/suburban and many rural areas of the country, although each network has strong and weak areas. \n There is no surcharge for calling to a mobile phone (calls to mobile phones are charged the same as calls to land lines), and mobile phones don't pay surcharges when calling domestic long-distance. Instead, mobile phones themselves are charged for all usage, outgoing and incoming. In other words, a call to/from a mobile phone carries the same cost to that mobile phone, but it doesn't matter whether it's local, domestic long-distance, or toll-free. Credit packages from $25/month allow you to make hundreds of minutes' worth of calls. A failed call (or a \"missed call\") will be charged since you are billed from the moment you dial. \n If you want to have a mobile phone in the U.S. while you travel, you have several options: \n  By mail[edit]   Self Service Postal Center\n \n\n Addressing mail with a properly-formatted address will expedite its journey with the United States Postal Service (USPS, not to be confused with the private shipper UPS). The ZIP code (postal code) is important, and you can look up ZIP codes and correct address formats online. A 5-digit ZIP code identifies a main post office; a 4-digit extension (recommended but optional) may narrow this to one business or an individual building. Addresses should be written in three to four lines with the name of recipient, house number and street name, suite or apartment or building number, city or town, two-letter state abbreviation, ZIP code, e.g.: \n Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.\n149 New Montgomery St.\nSan Francisco, CA 94105-3739\n First-class international airmail postcards and letters (up to one ounce/28.5 grams) cost $1.15. All locations with a ZIP code are considered domestic, including the 50 states, U.S. possessions, Micronesia (FSM), Marshall Islands, Palau and overseas military bases, ships (APO or FPO) and diplomatic posts (APO or DPO). Domestic postcards cost $0.35, and ordinary letters up to an ounce, $0.55 (2019). \"Forever\" stamps are available for the first ounce of domestic and international postage, and protect against future increases. Mailing thick or rigid objects, or non-standard shapes increases the postage cost. \n Poste Restante, the receiving of mail at a post office rather than a private address, is called General Delivery. There is no charge for this service. You must show ID such as a passport to pick up your mail. Post offices will usually hold mail for up to 30 days. If the city is large enough to have multiple post offices, only one (usually in the center of downtown) will allow General Delivery. \n FedEx and UPS also have a \"Hold for Pickup\" option and have locations throughout larger cities in the U.S. Though usually more expensive, these may be a better option when receiving something important from abroad. \n  By Internet[edit]  Given the ubiquity of private Internet access, Internet cafés are rare outside major cities and tourist areas. However, you do have some options, except perhaps in the most rural of areas. Accessible Wi-Fi networks, however, are common. \n  Wireless[edit]  The most generally useful Wi-Fi spots are in coffee shops, fast-food chains, and bookshops, though you may need to buy something first. Some cities also provide free Wi-Fi across their downtown areas. Try to use only public networks. Using a private network (even one without a password), unless authorized to do so, is illegal (though enforcement is nearly non-existent), and it may also allow criminals to track your browsing and so defraud you. Even traffic on public networks may be logged. \n A few less obvious Wi-Fi spots may be found in: \n Mobile broadband via a USB modem is also an option. Service providers include Verizon Wireless and Virgin Mobile (which uses the Sprint network). Make sure to check a coverage map before you buy, each company has large areas with bad or no coverage. Also, these plans are subject to data limits which are easy to exceed unknowingly! Avoid watching videos over a mobile network. \n  Public PC terminals[edit]  Internet cafés can still be found in some larger cities. Airports and shopping malls offer Internet access terminals for quick use, although these are generally disappearing. Access typically costs $1 for 1–2 minutes of web time. Any public computer will likely block access to undesirable websites. \n You may also consider: \n   This country travel guide to United States of America has guide status.

Note that boundary representations on these maps are not necessarily authoritative. The entry on Geographic coordinates may be helpful in finding some smaller countries. \n This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of the surfaces of all inland water bodies, such as lakes, reservoirs, or rivers, as delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines. \n This entry provides an area comparison based on total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of the Census.

Information is included by sex and age group as follows: 0-14 years (children), 15-24 years (early working age), 25-54 years (prime working age), 55-64 years (mature working age), 65 years and over (elderly). The age structure of a population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while countries with older population . . . \n Dependency ratios are a measure of the age structure of a population. They relate the number of individuals that are likely to be economically \"dependent\" on the support of others. Dependency ratios contrast the ratio of youths (ages 0-14) and the elderly (ages 65+) to the number of those in the working-age group (ages 15-64). Changes in the dependency ratio provide an indication of potential social support requirements resulting from changes in population age structures. As fertility leve . . . \n This entry is the age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from a low of about 15 in Niger and Uganda to 40 or more in several European countries and Japan. See the entry for \"Age structure\" for the importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by implication, a low versus a high . . . \n The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as . . . \n This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility and the age structure of the population. \n This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all ages, as declining . . . \n This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall level of population chan . . . \n This entry provides a summary description of the population dispersion within a country.

Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and fertilit . . . \n This entry provides the mean (average) age of mothers at the birth of their first child. It is a useful indicator for gauging the success of family planning programs aiming to reduce maternal mortality, increase contraceptive use – particularly among married and unmarried adolescents – delay age at first marriage, and improve the health of newborns. \n The maternal mortality rate (MMR) is the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes).

Note: Current Health Expenditure replaces the former Health Expenditures field . . . \n This entry gives the number of medical doctors (physicians), including generalist and specialist medical practitioners, per 1,000 of the population. Medical doctors are defined as doctors that study, diagnose, treat, and prevent illness, disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in humans through the application of modern medicine. They also plan, supervise, and evaluate care and treatment plans by other health care providers. The World Health Organization estimates that f . . . \n This entry provides the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people; it serves as a general measure of inpatient service availability. Hospital beds include inpatient beds available in public, private, general, and specialized hospitals and rehabilitation centers. In most cases, beds for both acute and chronic care are included. Because the level of inpatient services required for individual countries depends on several factors - such as demographic issues and the burden of disease - there is . . . \n This entry provides information about access to improved or unimproved sanitation facilities available to segments of the population of a country.

<b>America</b>, is a <span>country</span> comprising 50 <span>states</span>, a <span>federal district</span>, five major <span>self-governing territories</span>, and <span>various possessions</span>.<sup><span>[i]</span></sup> At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2</sup>), the United States is the world's <span>third or fourth largest country by total area</span><sup><span>[d]</span></sup> and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of <span>Europe</span>, which is 3.9 million square miles (10.1 million km<sup>2</sup>). With a population of over 327 million people, the U.S. is the <span>third most populous country</span>. The capital is <span>Washington, D.C.</span>, and the <span>most populous city</span> is <span>New York City</span>. Most of the country is located <span>contiguously</span> in <span>North America</span> between <span>Canada</span> and <span>Mexico</span>. </p>\n <p><span>Paleo-Indians</span><span>migrated from Siberia</span> to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago.<span>European colonization</span> began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the <span>thirteen British colonies</span> established along the <span>East Coast</span>. Following the <span>French and Indian War</span>, numerous disputes between <span>Great Britain</span> and the colonies led to the <span>American Revolution</span>, which began in 1775, and the <span>Declaration of Independence</span> in 1776. The war <span>ended in 1783</span> with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a <span>colonial empire</span>. The <span>current constitution</span> was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the <span>Bill of Rights</span>, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many <span>fundamental civil liberties</span>. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, <span>acquiring new territories</span>,<span>displacing Native American tribes</span>, and gradually <span>admitting new states</span> until it spanned the continent by 1848.</p>\n <p>During the second half of the 19th century, the <span>Civil War</span> led to the abolition of <span>slavery</span>. By the end of the century, the United States had reached the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the <span>Industrial Revolution</span>, began to soar. The <span>Spanish–American War</span> and <span><span>World War I</span></span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span><span>World War II</span></span> as a global <span>superpower</span>, the <span>first country to develop nuclear weapons</span>, the only country to <span>use them in warfare</span>, and a <span>permanent member</span> of the <span>United Nations Security Council</span>. Sweeping civil rights legislation passed under President <span>Lyndon B. Johnson</span>, notably the <span>Civil Rights Act of 1964</span>, the <span>Voting Rights Act of 1965</span> and the <span>Fair Housing Act of 1968</span>, outlawed discrimination based on race or color and established the country as a full <span>liberal democracy</span>. During the <span>Cold War</span>, the United States and the <span>Soviet Union</span> competed in the <span>Space Race</span>, culminating with the <span>1969 U.S. Moon landing</span>. The end of the Cold War and the <span>collapse of the Soviet Union</span> in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.</p>\n <p>The United States is the world's oldest surviving <span>federation</span>. It is a <span>federal republic</span> and a <span>representative democracy</span>.

Col. Joseph Reed</span>. Moylan expressed his wish to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort.<sup><span>[41]</span></sup><sup><span>[43]</span></sup> The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in <i><span>The Virginia Gazette</span></i> newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.<sup><span>[44]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The second draft of the <span>Articles of Confederation</span>, prepared by <span>John Dickinson</span> and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared \"The name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America<span>'</span>\".<sup><span>[45]</span></sup> The final version of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence \"The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America<span>'</span>\".<sup><span>[46]</span></sup> In June 1776, <span>Thomas Jefferson</span> wrote the phrase \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his \"original Rough draught\" of the <span>Declaration of Independence</span>.<sup><span>[45]</span></sup> This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.<sup><span>[45]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The short form \"United States\" is also standard. Other common forms are the \"U.S.\", the \"USA\", and \"America\". Colloquial names are the \"U.S. of A.\" and, internationally, the \"States\". \"<span>Columbia</span>\", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from <span>Christopher Columbus</span>; it appears in the name \"<span>District of Columbia</span>\", many landmarks and institutions in the Western Hemisphere bear his name, including the country of <span>Colombia</span>.<sup><span>[47]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The phrase \"United States\" was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., \"the United States are\"—including in the <span>Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</span>, ratified in 1865.<sup><span>[48]</span></sup> The singular form—e.g., \"the United States is\"—became popular after the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom \"these United States\". The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.<sup><span>[49]</span></sup></p>\n <p>A <span>citizen of the United States</span> is an \"<span>American</span>\". \"United States\", \"American\" and \"U.S.\" refer to the country adjectivally (\"American values\", \"U.S. forces\").

It is likely these represent the first of three major waves of migrations into North America.<sup><span>[57]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the <span>pre-Columbian</span><span>Mississippian culture</span> in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies.<sup><span>[58]</span></sup> The Mississippian culture flourished in the south from 800 to 1600 AD, extending from the Mexican border down through Florida.<sup><span>[59]</span></sup> Its city state <span>Cahokia</span> is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian <span>archaeological site</span> in the modern-day United States.<sup><span>[60]</span></sup> In the <span>Four Corners</span> region, <span>Ancestral Puebloans</span> culture developed as the culmination of centuries of agricultural experimentation, which produced greater dependence on farming.<sup><span>[61]</span></sup> Three <span>UNESCO World Heritage Sites</span> in the United States are credited to the Pueblos: <span>Mesa Verde National Park</span>, <span>Chaco Culture National Historical Park</span>, and <span>Taos Pueblo</span>.<sup><span>[63]</span></sup> The earthworks constructed by Native Americans of the <span>Poverty Point</span> culture in northeastern <span>Louisiana</span> have also been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. In the southern <span>Great Lakes</span> region, the <span>Iroquois Confederacy</span> (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.<sup><span>[64]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The date of the first settlements of the <span>Hawaiian Islands</span> is a topic of continuing debate.<sup><span>[65]</span></sup><span>Archaeological</span> evidence seems to indicate a settlement as early as 124 AD.<sup><span>[66]</span></sup></p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty><span>Effects on and interaction with native populations</span></h3> <div role=note>Further information: <span>American Indian Wars</span>, <span>Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas</span>, and <span>Native American disease and epidemics</span> </div>\n <p>With the progress of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the <span>Native Americans</span> were often <span>conquered and displaced</span>.<sup><span>[67]</span></sup> The <span>native population of America declined</span> after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as <span>smallpox</span> and <span>measles</span>.<sup><span>[68]</span></sup><sup><span>[69]</span></sup></p>\n <p>While estimating the original native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult, an attempt was made in the early part of the twentieth century by <span>James Mooney</span> using historic records to estimate the indigenous population north of <span>Mexico</span> in 1600.<sup><span>[70]</span></sup><sup><span>[71]</span></sup> In more recent years, <span>Douglas H. Ubelaker</span> of the <span>Smithsonian Institution</span> has updated these figures. While Ubelaker estimated that there was a population of 92,916 in the south Atlantic states and a population of 473,616 in the Gulf states, most academics regard the figure as too low.<sup><span>[70]</span></sup><span>Anthropologist</span><span>Henry F. Dobyns</span> believed that the populations were much higher, suggesting 1,100,000 along the shores of the gulf of Mexico, 2,211,000 people living between <span>Florida</span> and <span>Massachusetts</span>, 5,250,000 in the <span>Mississippi Valley</span> and tributaries and 697,000 people in the <span>Florida peninsula</span>.<sup><span>[70]</span></sup><sup><span>[71]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The first interaction between Europeans and Native Americans was made by the <span>Norsemen</span>. A number of surviving Norse <span>sagas</span> provide information regarding <span>The Maritimes</span> and its indigenous people. The Norse attempted to settle in North America about 500 years before Columbus.<sup><span>[73]</span></sup><sup><span>[74]</span></sup><sup><span>[75]</span></sup></p>\n <p>In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their <span>colonial wars</span>. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.<sup><span>[76]</span></sup> Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans, and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.<sup><span>[77]</span></sup><sup><span>[78]</span></sup></p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty><span>European settlements</span></h3> <div role=note>Further information: <span>Colonial history of the United States</span>, <span>European colonization of the Americas</span>, and <span>Thirteen Colonies</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/LOGY3i73oth5PREVxhrnzacNjgJB63B_RGpBFInUH7CemxfLX6R36w==/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/n4RaAhyQHZAtg1Hgp1chWVErt4CsETKKp2OikOOnthFXRdrYoYkUhAOwOIs=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/View_of_St._Augustine_FL_at_intersection_of_Cathedral_Pl_and_Charlotte_St_20160707_1.jpg/220px-View_of_St._Augustine_FL_at_intersection_of_Cathedral_Pl_and_Charlotte_St_20160707_1.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>St. Augustine, Florida</span>, the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States (1565)<sup><span>[79]</span></sup> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/10zEcKAdzuYMmKaaPnOFKb3GwF3qwjCyN1RZlMlkl98AkkwMCB9QIg==/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/qtRhWOAJzRzK5yBF4EIhf7y_0CXqXUAt2eg2Gt_i3keNgOpDOHATZTXXieg=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/The_Mayflower_Compact_1620_cph.3g07155.jpg/220px-The_Mayflower_Compact_1620_cph.3g07155.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <i>The <span>Mayflower Compact</span>, 1620</i> by <span>Jean Leon Gerome Ferris</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>With the advancement of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the <span>Native Americans</span> were often <span>conquered and displaced</span>.<sup><span>[80]</span></sup> The first Europeans to arrive in the territory of the modern United States were Spanish <span>conquistadors</span> such as <span>Juan Ponce de León</span>, who made his first visit to Florida in 1513; however, if <span>unincorporated territories</span> are accounted for, then credit would go to <span>Christopher Columbus</span> who landed in <span>Puerto Rico</span> on his <span>1493 voyage</span>. The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as <span>Saint Augustine</span><sup><span>[79]</span></sup> and <span>Santa Fe</span>. The French established their own as well along the <span>Mississippi River</span>. Successful <span>English settlement</span> on the eastern coast of North America began with the <span>Virginia Colony</span> in 1607 at <span>Jamestown</span> and the <span>Pilgrims'</span><span>Plymouth Colony</span> in 1620. Many settlers were <span>dissenting Christian groups</span> who came seeking <span>religious freedom</span>. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's <span>House of Burgesses</span> created in 1619, the <span>Mayflower Compact</span>, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the <span>Fundamental Orders of Connecticut</span>, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.<sup><span>[81]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. <span>Cash crops</span> included tobacco, rice, and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period, Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply.<sup><span>[83]</span></sup> Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of <span>Scotch-Irish</span> and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed <span>indentured servants</span> pushed further west.<sup><span>[84]</span></sup></p>\n <p>A large-scale slave trade with English privateers was begun.<sup><span>[85]</span></sup> The life expectancy of slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves.<sup><span>[86]</span></sup><sup><span>[87]</span></sup> Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.<sup><span>[88]</span></sup><sup><span>[89]</span></sup> But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.<sup><span>[90]</span></sup></p>\n <p>With the British colonization of <span>Georgia</span> in 1732, the <span>13 colonies</span> that would become the United States of America were established.<sup><span>[91]</span></sup> All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient <span>rights of Englishmen</span> and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism. With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.<sup><span>[93]</span></sup> The <span>Christian revivalist</span> movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the <span>Great Awakening</span> fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.<sup><span>[94]</span></sup></p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/oY1-eQROAnte4oCs8jRbcXNNvxyiq8y-yE186uhYiLYho6yc2iDqqw==/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/P5bqHJ5YkSE4W9mljHuPdDYX4Be5FRHWGc3y7_Pa2rJWzhATiH33F8YkvZA=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/North_America_1748.PNG/200px-North_America_1748.PNG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The <span>Thirteen Colonies</span> and neighboring polities in 1748</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>During the <span>Seven Years' War</span> (in the United States, known as the <span>French and Indian War</span>), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the <span>francophone</span> population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies.

Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.<sup><span>[95]</span></sup> The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated <span>monarchs</span> to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.<sup><span>[96]</span></sup></p>\n <p>In 1774, the <span>Spanish Navy</span> ship <i>Santiago</i>, under <span>Juan Pérez</span>, entered and anchored in an inlet of <span>Nootka Sound</span>, Vancouver Island, in present-day British Columbia.

Initially, states entering the Union had alternated between <span>slave and free states</span>, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.</p>\n <p>With the <span>1860 election</span> of <span>Abraham Lincoln</span>, the first president from the largely anti-slavery <span>Republican Party</span>, conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the <span>Confederate States of America</span> (the \"South\"), while the federal government (the \"<span>Union</span>\") maintained that secession was illegal. In order to bring about this secession, military action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind. The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians. The South fought for the freedom to own slaves, while the Union at first simply fought to maintain the country as one united whole. Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his <span>Emancipation Proclamation</span>, the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the <span>Thirteenth Amendment</span>, which prohibited slavery. </p>\n <p><span>Three amendments</span> were added to the U.S. Constitution in the years after the war: the aforementioned Thirteenth as well as the <span>Fourteenth Amendment</span> providing citizenship to the nearly four million <span>African Americans</span> who had been slaves,<sup><span>[130]</span></sup> and the <span>Fifteenth Amendment</span> ensuring in theory that African Americans had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in <span>federal power</span><sup><span>[131]</span></sup> aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the South while guaranteeing the rights of the newly freed slaves. </p>\n <p><span>Reconstruction</span> began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, <span>an assassin's bullet</span> on April 14, 1865, drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the <span>Compromise of 1877</span> when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the <span>presidential election of 1876</span>. </p>\n <p>Southern white Democrats, calling themselves \"<span>Redeemers</span>\", took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction. From 1890 to 1910, so-called <span>Jim Crow laws</span><span>disenfranchised</span> most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region.

The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements and a relative decline in unemployment. Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there has been debate about its effects on the economy.</p>\n <p>American forces in Iraq were <span>withdrawn</span> in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and the war in the region was declared formally over in December 2011. The withdrawal caused <span>an escalation of sectarian insurgency</span>, leading to the rise of the <span>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</span>, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region. In 2014, Obama announced a <span>restoration</span> of full <span>diplomatic relations with Cuba</span> for the first time since 1961.<sup>[<i><span><span title=\"The date of the event predicted near this tag has passed.

State courts conduct most criminal trials; <span>federal courts</span> handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. <span>Plea bargaining</span> is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by <span>plea bargain</span> rather than <span>jury trial</span>.<sup><span>[477]</span></sup></p>\n <p>In 2015, there were 15,696 murders which was 1,532 more than in 2014, a 10.8% increase, the largest since 1971.<sup><span>[478]</span></sup> The murder rate in 2015 was 4.9 per 100,000 people.<sup><span>[479]</span></sup> In 2016 the murder rate increased by 8.6%, with 17,413 murders that year.<sup><span>[480]</span></sup> The national <span>clearance rate</span> for homicides in 2015 was 64.1%, compared to 90% in 1965.<sup><span>[481]</span></sup> In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980. In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of <span>violent crime</span> and particularly high levels of <span>gun violence</span> compared to other developed nations.<sup><span>[483]</span></sup> A cross-sectional analysis of the <span>World Health Organization</span> Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States \"homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.\"<sup><span>[484]</span></sup><span>Gun ownership rights</span> continue to be the subject of <span>contentious political debate</span>. In 2016, the US murder rate of 5.4 per 100,000 was similar to the estimated global average of 5.15 per 100,000.<sup><span>[485]</span></sup></p>\n <p>In 2017, there were 17,264 murders and the murder rate was 5.3 per 100,000. Regarding weapons, 73% of murders were committed by firearm, 10% by knife and 17% by other means.<sup><span>[486]</span></sup> The violent crime rose sharply in the 1960s until the early 1990s and declined in the late 1990s and 2000s.<sup><span>[486]</span></sup> In 2014, the murder rate fell to the lowest level (4.5) since 1957 (4.0).<sup><span>[487]</span></sup> The violent crime rate increased by 5.9% between 2014 and 2017 and the murder rate by 20.5%. Of those arrested for serious violent crimes in 2017, 58.5% were white, 37.5% were black, 2.1% were American Indian or Alaska Native and 1.5% Asian. Ethnically, 23.5% were Hispanic and 76.5% were non-Hispanic.<sup><span>[488]</span></sup> Gun violence peaked in 1993 with 17,125 gun murders before declining to 9,527 in 1999 and steadily rising since to 12,772. Non-gun murders reached a peak in 1980 of 8,340 and declined in most years until the early 2010s with 4,668 in 2017.<sup><span>[489]</span></sup> The rate of robberies declined 62% between 1990 and 2017.<sup><span>[486]</span></sup></p>\n <p>From 1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of homicide victims and 90% of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites (\"whites\" includes most Hispanics), and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims killed by whites.<sup><span>[490]</span></sup> In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.<sup><span>[491]</span></sup> The FBI's <span>Uniform Crime Reports</span> estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes.</p>\n <p><span>Capital punishment</span> is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and also at the state level in 30 states.<sup><span>[493]</span></sup><sup><span>[494]</span></sup> No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a <span>U.S. Supreme Court ruling</span> striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976 the Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and <span>Oklahoma</span>.<sup><span>[495]</span></sup> Meanwhile, <span>several states</span> have either abolished or struck down death-penalty laws.

In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by <span>NPR</span> (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the <span>Public Broadcasting Act of 1967</span>; its television counterpart, <span>PBS</span>, was also created by the same legislation (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other).

With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as <span>Gannett</span> or <span>McClatchy</span>, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have \"alternative weeklies\" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's <i><span>The Village Voice</span></i> or Los Angeles' <i><span>LA Weekly</span></i>, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.

On July 4, 1776, they issued the <span>Declaration of Independence</span>, which announced their independence from Great Britain and their creation of a cooperative union. The disobedient states defeated Great Britain in the <span>American Revolutionary War</span>, the first successful <span>colonial war of independence</span>.<sup><span>[10]</span></sup> The <span>Philadelphia Convention</span> adopted the current <span>United States Constitution</span> on September 17, 1787; its approval the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government. The <span>Bill of Rights</span>, making up ten <span>constitutional amendments</span> guaranteeing many basic civil rights and freedoms, was approved in 1791. </p>\n <p>In the 19th century, the United States received land from <span>France</span>, <span>Spain</span>, the <span>United Kingdom</span>, <span>Mexico</span>, and <span>Russia</span>, and <span>took over</span> the <span>Republic of Texas</span> and the <span>Republic of Hawaii</span>.

The North's victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the <span>end of legal slavery</span> in the United States. By the 1870s, the national wealth was the world's largest.<sup><span>[11]</span></sup> The <span>Spanish–American War</span> and <span>World War I</span> confirmed the country's status as a military power.

Announcing that \"<span>all men are created equal</span>\" and are born with \"certain <span>natural rights</span>,\" the Congress adopted the <span>Declaration of Independence</span>, drafted mostly by <span>Thomas Jefferson</span>, on July 4, 1776. That date is now celebrated every year as America's <span>Independence Day</span>. In 1777, the <span>Articles of Confederation</span> established a weak federal government that operated until 1789. </p>\n <p>After the <span>British defeat</span> by American forces <span>helped by the French</span>, Great Britain <span>recognized the independence of the United States</span> and the states' <span>sovereignty</span> over American land west to the <span>Mississippi River</span>. A <span>constitutional convention</span> was organized in 1787 by those wishing to establish a strong national government, with powers of taxation. The <span>United States Constitution</span> was approved in 1788, and the new republic's <span>first Senate, House of Representatives</span>, and <span>President</span>—George Washington—took office in 1789. The <span>Bill of Rights</span>, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and certifying a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791. </p>\n <p>Attitudes toward <span>slavery</span> were shifting; a <span>clause in the Constitution</span> protected the African slave trade only until 1808. The Northern states permanently stopped slavery between 1780 and 1804, leaving the <span>slave states</span> of the South as defenders of the \"<span>peculiar institution</span>.\" The <span>Second Great Awakening</span>, beginning about 1800, made <span>evangelicalism</span> a force behind different social <span>reform movements</span>, including <span>abolitionism</span>. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/h2ye7sRzetawEA6arxkWrlOBXNtM5PiA1i2Gune9MGsaZGqiTzGLNSKF02w=/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/Ysy5E2XSIgwAzoNF-1T7p6bVF8ihdbjHLbj4KfrQi9gqGc3aiRAGymCdrmk=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/U.S._Territorial_Acquisitions.png/220px-U.S._Territorial_Acquisitions.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Land-based purchases by date.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Americans' eagerness to <span>expand westward</span> caused a long series of <span>Indian Wars</span> and an <span>Indian removal</span> policy that stripped the native peoples of their land. The <span>Louisiana Purchase</span> of French-claimed land under President Thomas Jefferson in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size. The <span>War of 1812</span>, declared against Britain over different complaints and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. <span>nationalism</span>. A series of U.S. military invasions into Florida led <span>Spain to give up</span> it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. The United States took over the <span>Republic of Texas</span> in 1845. The idea of <span>Manifest destiny</span> became popular during this time.<sup><span>[19]</span></sup> The 1846 <span>Oregon Treaty</span> with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day <span>American Northwest</span>. The U.S. victory in the <span>Mexican–American War</span> resulted in the 1848 <span>cession</span> of <span>California</span> and much of the present-day <span>American Southwest</span>. The <span>California Gold Rush</span> of 1848–49 further encouraged western relocation. New railways made relocation easier for settlers and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, up to 40 million <span>American bison</span>, or buffalo, were murdered for skins and meat and to ease the railways' spread. The loss of the buffalo, which were valuable to the <span>plains Indians</span>, caused many native cultures to become gone forever. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Civil War and industrialization</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div role=note>See also: <span>American Civil War</span>, <span>Reconstruction era</span>, and <span>Spanish–American War</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/_V2EmRKoDwvIbjyeZX-xaejklc2KDDujT5pghu5Zx9spmqVi64zKQ1Ib7zg=/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/KvBeU8hdkV0x82W3A_p_7Y1NeU52RFwxSkmyENvhR5iUoID8A1XqeFFtAng=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Battle_of_Gettysburg%2C_by_Currier_and_Ives.png/220px-Battle_of_Gettysburg%2C_by_Currier_and_Ives.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <i><span>Battle of Gettysburg</span></i>, lithograph by <span>Currier and Ives</span>, ca. 1863</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><span>Tensions</span> between slave and <span>free states</span> mounted with arguments over the relationship between the <span>state and federal governments</span>, as well as <span>violent conflicts</span> over the spread of slavery into new states. <span>Abraham Lincoln</span>, a candidate of the mostly antislavery <span>Republican Party</span>, was elected president in 1860.

The wave of immigration, lasting until 1929, gave labor and changed American culture. High tax protections, national infrastructure building, and new banking laws encouraged growth also. The 1867 <span>Alaska Purchase</span> from Russia completed the country's mainland expansion. The <span>Wounded Knee Massacre</span> in 1890 was the last major armed conflict of the <span>Indian Wars</span>. In 1893, the <span>native monarchy</span> of the Pacific <span>Kingdom of Hawaii</span> was ended in a secret and successful plan led by American residents; the United States took over the archipelago in 1898.

In the Senate, each state is represented equally, by two senators. Because there are 50 states, there are 100 senators. The President's <span>treaties</span> or appointments of <span>officials</span> need the Senate's approval. Senators serve six-year terms. The Vice President of the United States serves as president of the Senate. In practice, the vice president is usually absent from the Senate, and a senator serves as president <span>pro tempore</span>, or <a href=https://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/temporary title=wikt:temporary rel=nofollow target=_blank>temporary</a> president, of the Senate. </p>\n <p>Representatives and senators <span>propose</span> laws, called \"<span>bills</span>\", in their respective houses. A bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group, known as a <span>committee</span>, which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house. If one house votes to pass a bill, the bill then gets sent to the other house; if both houses vote for it, it is then sent to the president, who may sign the bill into law or <span>veto</span> it. If the president vetoes the bill, it is sent back to Congress. If Congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two-thirds <span>majority</span>, the bill becomes law and cannot be vetoed by the president. </p>\n <p>Under the American system of <span>federalism</span>, Congress may not make laws that directly control the states; instead, Congress may use the promise of federal funds, or special circumstances such as national <span>emergencies</span>, to encourage the states to follow federal law. This system is both complex and unique. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Judicial branch</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The <span>judicial branch</span> is the part of government that interprets what the law means. The Judicial Branch is made up of the <span>Supreme Court</span> and many lower courts. If the Supreme Court decides that a law is not allowed by <span>the Constitution</span>, the law is said to be \"struck down\" and is no longer a <span>valid</span> law. </p>\n <p>The Supreme Court is made up of nine <span>judges</span>, called justices, who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. One of these justices, called the <span>chief justice</span>, heads the court. A Supreme Court justice serves until he or she dies or <span>resigns</span> (quits in the middle of his or her term). When that happens, the president nominates someone new to replace the justice who left. If the Senate agrees with that choice, the person becomes a justice. If the Senate does not agree with the president's choice, then the president must nominate someone else. </p>\n <p>Famous court cases such as <i><span>Marbury v Madison</span></i> (which was decided in 1803) have firmly established that the Supreme Court is the <span>ultimate interpreter</span> of the <span>United States Constitution</span> and has the power to strike down any law that <span>conflicts</span> with it.<sup><span>[44]</span></sup></p>\n <h2> <span>Politics</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <div role=note>See also: <span>States of the United States</span> and <span>Politics of the United States</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/lm6oX-WQq8T6n412MkmyRa8A0WMcbwy-14SkO1BUnwXE4dK_xt9YEYKATHU=/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/XtQfFTCgsdPFG5Ri3MGKDaHRH2Dp16ZUnCRDQTRGmbIzPjryv7bM1mfU-fw=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Political_System_of_the_United_States.svg/220px-Political_System_of_the_United_States.svg.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The political system of the United States</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The United States of America consists of <span>50 states</span>, 5 territories and 1 district (<span>Washington D.C</span>.). States can make laws about things inside the state, but federal law is about things dealing with more than one state or dealing with other countries. In some areas, if the federal government makes laws that say different things from the state laws, people must follow the federal law because the state law is not a law any more. Each state has a constitution of its own, different from the federal (national) Constitution. Each of these is like the federal Constitution because they say how each state's government is set up, but some also talk about specific laws. </p>\n <p>The federal and most state governments are dominated by two <span>political parties</span>: the <span>Republicans</span> and the <span>Democrats</span>. There are many smaller parties; the largest of these are the <span>Libertarian Party</span> and the <span>Green Party</span>. People help in political <span>campaigns</span> that they like. They try to persuade politicians to help them; this is called <span>lobbying</span>. All Americans are allowed to do these things, but some have and spend more money than others, or in other ways do more in politics. Some people think this is a problem, and lobby for rules to be made to change it. </p>\n <p>Since 2017, the president is a Republican, and Congress is also Republican-controlled, so the Republicans have more power in the federal government. There are still many powerful Democrats who can try to stop the Republicans from doing things that they believe will be bad for the country. Also, members of a party in power do not always agree on what to do. If enough people decide to vote against Republicans in the next election, they will lose power. In a republic like the United States, no party can do whatever they want. All politicians have to argue, compromise, and make deals with each other to get things done. They have to answer to the people and take responsibility for their mistakes. </p>\n <p>The USA's large <span>cultural</span>, economic, and military influence has made the <span>foreign policy of the United States</span>, or relations with other countries, a topic in American politics, and the politics of many other countries. </p>\n <h2 no-attr=empty> <span>Political divisions</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <div role=note>Main articles: <span>U.S. state</span>, <span>Territorial evolution of the United States</span>, and <span>Territorial changes of the United States</span> </div>\n <h3> <span>States</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div role=note>See also: <span>List of U.S. states</span> </div>\n <p>The United States <span>conquered</span> and <span>bought</span> new lands over time, and grew from the original 13 colonies in the east to the current 50 states, of which 48 of them are <span>joined together</span> to make up the <span>contiguous United States</span>.

<strong>U.S.</strong> or <strong>U.S.A.</strong>, byname <strong>America</strong>, country in <span>North America</span>, a federal <span>republic</span> of 50 states. Besides the 48 conterminous states that occupy the middle latitudes of the continent, the <span>United States</span> includes the state of <span>Alaska</span>, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and the island state of <span>Hawaii</span>, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The conterminous states are bounded on the north by <span>Canada</span>, on the east by the <span>Atlantic Ocean</span>, on the south by the <span>Gulf of Mexico</span> and <span>Mexico</span>, and on the west by the <span>Pacific Ocean</span>. The United States is the fourth largest country in the world in area (after <span>Russia</span>, Canada, and<span> China</span>). The national capital is <span>Washington</span>, which is coextensive with the <span>District of Columbia</span>, the federal capital region created in 1790.</p>\n <p>The major characteristic of the United States is probably its great variety. Its physical <a href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment data-term=environment rel=nofollow target=_blank>environment</a> ranges from the <span>Arctic</span> to the subtropical, from the moist <span>rain forest</span> to the arid desert, from the rugged mountain peak to the flat <span>prairie</span>. Although the total population of the United States is large by world standards, its overall population density is relatively low. The country embraces some of the world’s largest urban concentrations as well as some of the most extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.</p>\n <div><span><figure data-type=image data-assembly-id=208185><div data-type=image><div><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/2gLiX0vpg_0CB4xqSComm3t2V9vt7_X570KMq8A0A7z31W7Abcr8F7fT/place/United-States__-__/tunnel/kkIPwSFjTrEC3jNug30464RX4A-OJWJEpvrXuQOPVXVs7nJ_6OSajxvE/s:700x450/85/183785-050-77A0FDB5/The-United-States.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></div>\n</div>\n <figcaption><strong>United States</strong><span>The United States.</span><cite>Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.</cite></figcaption></figure></span></div>\n <p>The United States contains a highly <a href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diverse data-term=diverse rel=nofollow target=_blank>diverse</a> population. Unlike a country such as China that largely incorporated <a href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indigenous data-term=indigenous rel=nofollow target=_blank>indigenous</a> peoples, the United States has a <a href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diversity data-term=diversity rel=nofollow target=_blank>diversity</a> that to a great degree has come from an immense and sustained global immigration. Probably no other country has a wider range of racial, ethnic, and cultural types than does the United States. In addition to the presence of surviving <span>Native Americans</span> (including American Indians, <span>Aleuts</span>, and <span>Eskimos</span>) and the descendants of Africans taken as slaves to the New World, the national character has been enriched, tested, and constantly redefined by the tens of millions of immigrants who by and large have come to America hoping for greater social, political, and economic opportunities than they had in the places they left. (It should be noted that although the terms “America” and “Americans” are often used as synonyms for the United States and its citizens, respectively, they are also used in a broader sense for North, South, and <span>Central America</span> collectively and their citizens.)</p>\n <p>The United States is the world’s greatest economic power, measured in terms of <span>gross domestic product</span> (GDP). The nation’s wealth is partly a reflection of its rich natural resources and its enormous agricultural output, but it owes more to the country’s highly developed industry. Despite its relative economic self-sufficiency in many areas, the United States is the most important single factor in world trade by virtue of the sheer size of its economy. Its exports and imports represent major proportions of the world total. The United States also impinges on the global economy as a source of and as a destination for investment capital. The country continues to sustain an economic life that is more diversified than any other on Earth, providing the majority of its people with one of the world’s highest standards of living.</p>\n <div data-marketing-id=INLINE_SUBSCRIPTION><div> Like what you’re reading? <span>Start your free trial today for unlimited access to Britannica.</span> </div>\n</div>\n <p>The United States is relatively young by world standards, being less than 250 years old; it achieved its current size only in the mid-20th century. America was the first of the European colonies to separate successfully from its motherland, and it was the first nation to be established on the <a href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premise data-term=premise rel=nofollow target=_blank>premise</a> that <a href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sovereignty data-term=sovereignty rel=nofollow target=_blank>sovereignty</a> rests with its citizens and not with the government. In its first century and a half, the country was mainly preoccupied with its own territorial expansion and <span>economic growth</span> and with social debates that ultimately led to civil war and a healing period that is still not complete. In the 20th century the United States emerged as a world power, and since <span>World War II</span> it has been one of the preeminent powers. It has not accepted this mantle easily nor always carried it willingly; the principles and ideals of its founders have been tested by the pressures and <a href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exigencies data-term=exigencies rel=nofollow target=_blank>exigencies</a> of its dominant status. The United States still offers its residents opportunities for unparalleled personal advancement and wealth. However, the depletion of its resources, the contamination of its environment, and the continuing social and <span>economic inequality</span> that perpetuates areas of poverty and <a href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blight data-term=blight rel=nofollow target=_blank>blight</a> all threaten the fabric of the country.</p>\n <p>The District of Columbia is discussed in the article <span>Washington</span>.

It's home to a wide array of popular tourist destinations, ranging from the skyscrapers of <span>Manhattan</span> and <span>Chicago</span> to the natural wonders of <span>Yellowstone</span> and <span>Alaska</span>, to the warm, sunny beaches of <span>Florida</span> and <span>Hawaii</span> and the deserts of <span>Arizona</span>. </p>\n <h2> <span>Understand</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <dl><dd no-attr=empty> <i>\"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness.\"</i><small no-attr=empty>— Mark Twain. <i>The Innocents Abroad</i></small> </dd></dl> <p>The United States can not be defined solely by television and movies. It is large, complex, and diverse, with several distinct regional identities. Due to the vast distances involved, traveling between regions often means crossing through many different landscapes, climates, and even time zones. Such travel can often be time-consuming and expensive but is often very rewarding. </p>\n <h3> <span>Geography</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The <b>contiguous United States</b> or the \"Lower 48\" (the 48 states other than Alaska and Hawaii) is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west, with much of the population living on the two coasts. Its land borders are shared with <span>Canada</span> to the north, and <span>Mexico</span> to the south. The US also shares maritime borders with <span>Russia</span>, <span>Cuba</span>, and the <span>Bahamas</span>. If counting the Insular Areas and Minor Outlying Islands, the <span>United Kingdom</span>, <span>Samoa</span>, and <span>Haiti</span> would also share maritime borders. </p>\n <p>The country has three major mountain ranges. The <b><span>Appalachians</span></b> extend from Canada to the state of <span>Alabama</span>, a few hundred miles west of the Atlantic Ocean. They are the oldest of the three mountain ranges and are covered with a diversity of flora and fauna, a thick canopy of dense vegetation. They offer spectacular sightseeing and excellent camping spots. The loess lands of the southern Mid-West and the Limestone cliffs and mountains of the south add beauty to the region, with lush vegetation coating the surfaces of cliff faces that border rivers, and mist shrouding beautiful green mountains and gorges. The <b><span>Rockies</span></b> are, on average, the tallest in North America, extending from <span>BC, Canada</span> to <span>New Mexico</span>, with many areas protected as national parks. They offer hiking, camping, skiing, and sightseeing opportunities, as well as desert and subtropical getaways in the southern lowlands of the region. The combined <b><span>Sierra Nevada</span></b> and <b>Cascade</b> ranges are the youngest. The Sierras extend across the \"backbone\" of <span>California</span>, with sites such as <span>Lake Tahoe</span> and <span>Yosemite National Park</span>; the Sierras transition at their northern end into the even younger volcanic Cascade range, with some of the highest points in the country. </p>\n <p>The <span>Great Lakes</span> define much of the border between the eastern United States and Canada. More inland seas than lakes, they were formed by the pressure of glaciers retreating north at the end of the last Ice Age. The five lakes span hundreds of miles, bordering the states of <span>Minnesota</span>, <span>Wisconsin</span>, <span>Illinois</span>, <span>Indiana</span>, <span>Michigan</span>, <span>Ohio</span>, <span>Pennsylvania</span> and <span>New York</span>, and their shores vary from pristine wilderness areas to industrial \"rust belt\" cities. They are the second-largest bodies of freshwater in the world, after the polar ice caps. </p>\n <p>The western portions of the USA are rugged and contain arid landscapes, complete with wind-shaped desert sand dunes like White Sands, New Mexico. In California, Death Valley is the lowest spot on the USA mainland (282 feet below sea level) and is one of the hottest places on Earth. Natural areas include vast areas of desert untouched by humans. Camping and hiking through the majestic landscapes of the Southwest is a big vacation draw for many Americans. </p>\n <p>Florida is very low-lying, with long white sand beaches lining both sides of the state. The tropical climate enables many exotic (both native and non-native) plants and animals to flourish. The Florida Everglades are a pristine \"river of grass,\" made up of tropical jungles and savanna are home to 20-foot alligators and crocodiles, among many other creatures. </p>\n <p>The USA contains every biome on earth. The USA has something for everyone; tropical jungles, subtropical and temperate savannas, searing deserts, Mediterranean-like coast lines, frozen mountain peaks, coniferous forests, steamy subtropical river systems, and more. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/4m8uwu5I2V9sE43rxQm32KUijp_JJZSi8Kg9J_yJN4e6t5AkRo0=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/R7eGcR9OBFqw2lUehEhB7gOZn085IT9c15s7HyUMZvna57KS1HI=/upload/shared//thumb/e/e6/Grand_Tetons_Wyoming_USA.jpg/390px-Grand_Tetons_Wyoming_USA.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>Grand Tetons</span>, <span>Rocky Mountains</span>, <span>Wyoming</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Time zones in USA</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The United States Has a total of six time zones. </p>\n <p>Eastern Time Zone </p>\n <p>States that observes Eastern time only </p>\n <p>Connecticut Delaware Georgia Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire New Jersey New York North Carolina Ohio Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina Vermont Virginia West Virginia </p>\n <p>States that split between eastern and central: Florida Tennessee Indiana Michigan Kentucky </p>\n <p>Central Time Zone </p>\n <p>States that Observes Central Time Only </p>\n <p>Alabama Arkansas Illinois Iowa Louisiana Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Wisconsin </p>\n <p>States that Observes Central and Mountain Time Kansas Nebraska North Dakota South Dakota Oklahoma Texas </p>\n <p><br>\n Mountain Time Zone </p>\n <p>States that Observes Mountain Time Only </p>\n <p>Colorado Montana New Mexico Utah Wyoming </p>\n <p>States that Observes Mountain Time and Pacific Time </p>\n <p>Arizona* Arizona is in the Mountain Time Zone however during the summer this state observes Pacific Daylight Time.

This area of the United States has long, hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters on average. The Entire eastern half of the United States often succumbs to very hot weather during the summer with high humidity. In the southern portions of the southern states, a number of tropical-transitional climates are found, with Florida and southern Texas hosting a variety of tropical climates. The Midwest region hosts a variety of climates, from humid subtropical in the southern regions, to a warm temperate regime in the central portions, and a humid continental regimes in the more northerly areas of the region. The entire region is susceptible to extensive amount of very hot, humid weather, and more northerly regions of the Midwest often succumb to bitterly cold temperatures in the winter. </p>\n <p>The Plains states range from humid subtropical in swathes of Kansas and Oklahoma, to warm temperate in most of Nebraska and areas of South Dakota, to a rather harsh humid continental climate in parts of South Dakota and much of North Dakota. All border semi-arid and near desert climates that often get searingly hot and alternate between dry and humid for much of the year </p>\n <p>The west is largely very hot with mostly mild winters, until you get to the northern mountain regions, where, primarily due to elevation, a variety of colder highland climates exist. Most of the region consists of extremely hot or warm arid climates, with very mild to cool winters. This is an extremely rugged, mountainous region. The west coast contains a variety of hot Mediterranean climates, as well as cooler subtypes of this climate, and an oceanic maritime climate in the northwestern regions. The west coast also contains a variety of subtropical and tropical transitional climes. Parts of <span>Arizona</span> and <span>New Mexico</span> have a monsoon season which lasts from June to September. Frequent training thunderstorms often occur in this area during the summer, which can result in flooding. Dust storms can also occur, caused by downdrafts of a decaying thunderstorm. </p>\n <p>Florida contains a variety of tropical climates, with frequent thunderstorms and very high humidity. The climate nears the humid subtropical regime of the rest of the United States the further north in the state you travel. The humid subtropical climate regime is the predominant climate regime of the United States. </p>\n <p>The Great Plains are notorious for their tornado season, which lasts from March to June. These severe weather outbreaks can also cause very large hail, damaging winds, and flooding. Severe weather in the Great Plains is often forecast days in advance by meteorologists and reported by local news stations via TV and social media. </p>\n <p>Hawaii has a variety of tropical climates. </p>\n <p>Central and northern Alaska features subarctic and arctic climates with short mild summers and long very cold winters. </p>\n <p>The least variation of climate in the continental United States occurs during the summer, when much of the nation is warm to hot, with average highs from 80/90 F (27-32°C) weather, often reaching 100 F for many days at a time throughout many regions of the country. Desert valleys in the Western United States often see the highest temperatures in the nation, along with many days and sometimes weeks of very dry weather. San Francisco and coastal Washington have the coolest summers in the Western United States excluding alpine regions of eastern California and Colorado. The greatest difference in climate from region to region occurs during the winter season, which is mainly December to February, when temperatures can range from below 0 degrees (-18°C) in the Northern Great Plains, to a much milder 75 (24°C) in the southern regions of the country. Long stretches of below freezing temperatures are common during the winter season across the Northern Midwest and Northern Northeast, getting milder as you travel south, therefore, travelers should prepare to dress accordingly: American weather can be violent and unpredictable. </p>\n <h3> <span>History</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/oU6iSF9x3TXex7W4XAmEFLvzb8eh2XISsqpXX1BuOdqeXU7ecBg=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/UUWa4jsAZrIMypUYTBHgDZZp6oK-ZcvW0r7zqDwjcfEIfIdWjFI=/upload/shared//thumb/6/67/Alamo_San_Antonio_Texas_USA.jpg/300px-Alamo_San_Antonio_Texas_USA.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The Alamo, <span>San Antonio</span>, <span>Texas</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>What is now the United States was initially populated by indigenous peoples who migrated from northeast Asia. Today, their descendants are known as Native Americans, or American Indians. Although Native Americans are often portrayed as having lived a mundane and primitive lifestyle which consisted of day to day survival, the truth is that prior to European contact, the continent was densely populated by many sophisticated societies. For example, the Cherokee are descended from the Mississippian culture which built huge mounds and large towns that covered the landscape, while the Anasazi built elaborate cliff-side towns in the Southwest. As was the case in other nations in the Americas, the primitive existence attributed to Native Americans was generally the result of mass die-offs triggered by Old World diseases such as smallpox which spread like wildfire in the 15th and 16th centuries. By the time most Native American tribes directly encountered Europeans, they were a post-apocalyptic people. </p>\n <p>During the late 16th and 17th centuries, multiple European nations began colonizing the North American continent. <span>Spain</span>, <span>France</span>, <span>Great Britain</span>, the <span>Netherlands</span>, <span>Sweden</span>, and Russia established colonies in various parts of present day continental United States. Of those early settlements, it was the original British colonies in <span>Virginia</span> and <span>Massachusetts</span> that formed the cultural, political, legal and economic core of what is now the United States. </p>\n <p>Massachusetts was first settled by religious immigrants, known as Puritans, who later spread and founded most of the other New England colonies, creating a highly religious and idealistic region. Its neighbor to the southwest, Rhode Island, was founded by refugees from the religious fanatics of Massachusetts. Other religious groups also founded colonies, including the Quakers in <span>Pennsylvania</span> and Roman Catholics in <span>Maryland</span>. </p>\n <p>Virginia, on the other hand, became the most dominant of the southern colonies. Because of a longer growing season, these colonies had richer agricultural prospects, specifically cotton and tobacco. As in Central and South America, African slaves were imported and forced to cultivate in large plantations. Slavery became an important part of the economy in the South, a fact that would cause tremendous upheaval in the years to come. </p>\n <p>By the early 18th century, the United Kingdom had established a number of colonies along the Atlantic coast from <span>Georgia</span> north into what is now Canada. On July 4th, 1776, colonists from the Thirteen Colonies, frustrated with excessive taxation and micromanagement by London and encouraged by the ideals of Enlightenment philosophy, declared independence from the UK and established a new sovereign nation, the United States of America. The resulting American Revolutionary War culminated in the surrender of 7,000 British troops at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. This forced the British government to initiate peace negotiations that led to the Treaty of Paris of 1783, by which the victorious Americans assumed control of all British land south of the Great Lakes between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River. British loyalists, known as Tories, fled north of the Great Lakes into Canada, which remained stubbornly loyal to the British crown and would not become fully independent until 1982. </p>\n <p>Although the Thirteen Colonies had united during the war in support of the common objective of getting rid of British tyranny, most colonists' loyalties at the end of the war lay with their respective colonial governments. In turn, the young country's first attempt at establishing a national government under the Articles of Confederation was a disastrous failure. The Articles tried too hard to protect the colonies from each other by making the national government so weak it could not do anything. </p>\n <p>In 1787, a convention of major political leaders (the Founding Fathers of the United States) drafted a new national Constitution in Philadelphia. After ratification by a supermajority of the states, the new Constitution went into effect in 1791 and enabled the establishment of the strong federal government that has governed the United States ever since. George Washington, the commanding general of American forces during the Revolutionary War, was elected as the first President of the United States under the new Constitution. By the turn of the 19th century, a national capital had been established in <span>Washington, D.C.</span>. </p>\n <p>As American and European settlers pushed farther west, past the Appalachians, the federal government began organizing new territories and then admitting them as new states. This was enabled by the displacement and decimation of the Native American populations through warfare and disease. In what became known as the Trail of Tears, the Cherokee tribe was forcibly relocated from the Southeastern United States to present-day Oklahoma, which was known as \"Indian Territory\" until the early 20th century. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 brought French-owned territory extending from the Mississippi River to parts of the present-day Western United States under American control, effectively doubling the country's land area. </p>\n <p>The United States fought the War of 1812 with Britain as a reaction to British impressment of American sailors, as well as to attempt to capture parts of Canada. Though dramatic battles were fought, including one that ended with the British Army burning the White House, Capitol, and other public buildings in Washington, D.C., the war ended in a virtual stalemate. Territorial boundaries between the two nations remained nearly the same. Nevertheless, the war had disastrous consequences for the western Native American tribes that had allied with the British, with the United States acquiring more and more of their territory for white settlers. </p>\n <p>Florida was purchased in 1813 from Spain after the American military had effectively subjugated the region. The next major territorial acquisition came after American settlers in Texas rebelled against the Mexican government, setting up a short-lived independent republic that was absorbed into the union. The <b>Mexican-American War</b> of 1848 resulted in acquisition of the northern territories of Mexico, including the future states of California, <span>Nevada</span>, <span>Utah</span>, Arizona and New Mexico. After 1850, the borders of the continental United States reached the rough outlines it still has today. Many Native Americans were relegated to reservations by treaty, military force, and by the inadvertent spread of European diseases transmitted by large numbers of settlers moving west along the <b>Oregon Trail</b> and other routes. </p>\n <p>Tensions between the US and the British government administering Canada continued to persist because the border west of the Great Lakes was ill-defined. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 failed to adequately address the complex geography of the region; the boundary dispute remained unsettled until 1871. </p>\n <p>Meanwhile, by the late 1850s, many Americans were calling for the abolition of slavery. The rapidly industrializing North, where slavery had been outlawed several decades before, favored national abolition. Southern states, on the other hand, believed that individual states had the right to decide whether or not slavery should be legal. In 1861, the Southern states, fearing domination by the North and the Republican President Nominee <b>Abraham Lincoln</b>, seceded from the Union and formed the breakaway <b>Confederate States of America</b>. These events sparked the <b>American Civil War</b>. To date, it is the bloodiest conflict on American soil, with over 200,000 killed in combat and a overall death toll exceeding 600,000. In 1865, Union forces prevailed, thereby cementing the federal government's authority over the states. The federal government then launched a complex process of rehabilitation and re-assimilation of the Confederacy, a period known as <b>Reconstruction</b>. Slavery was abolished by constitutional amendment, but the former slaves and their descendants were to remain an economic and social underclass, particularly in the South. </p>\n <p>The United States purchased Alaska [AK] from Russia in 1867, and the previously independent Hawaii was annexed in 1898 after a brief revolution fomented by American settlers. After decisively defeating Spain in the <b>Spanish-American War</b>, the United States gained its first \"colonial\" territories: Cuba (granted independence a few years later), the <span>Philippines</span> (granted independence shortly after World War II), <span>Puerto Rico</span> and <span>Guam</span> (which remain American dependencies today). During this \"imperialist\" phase of US history, the US also assisted Panama in obtaining independence from Colombia, as the need for a Panama Canal had become palpably clear to the US during the Spanish-American War. In 1903, the new country of Panama promptly granted the United States control over a swath of territory known as the Canal Zone. The US constructed the Panama Canal in 1914 and retained control over the Canal Zone until 1979. </p>\n <p>In the eastern cities of the United States, Southern and Eastern Europeans, and Russian Jews joined Irish refugees to become a cheap labor force for the country's growing <b>industrialization</b>. Many African-Americans fled rural poverty in the South for industrial jobs in the North, in what is now known as the <b>Great Migration</b>. Other immigrants, including many Scandinavians and Germans, moved to the now-opened territories in the West and Midwest, where land was available for free to anyone who would develop it. A network of <b>railroads</b> was laid across the country, accelerating development. </p>\n <p>With its entrance into <b>World War I</b> in 1917, the United States established itself as a world power by helping to defeat Germany and the Central Powers. However after the war, despite strong support from President Woodrow Wilson, the United States refused to join the newly-formed League of Nations, which substantially hindered that body's effectiveness in preventing future conflicts. </p>\n <p>Real wealth grew rapidly in the postwar period. During the <b>Roaring Twenties</b>, stock speculation created an immense \"bubble\" which, when it burst in October 1929, contributed to a period of economic havoc in the 1930s known as the <b>Great Depression</b>. The Depression was brutal and devastating, with unemployment rising to 25%. On the other hand, it helped forge a culture of sacrifice and hard work that would serve the country well in its next conflict. President Herbert Hoover lost his re-election bid in 1932 as a result of his ineffective response to the Depression. The victor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt (\"FDR\") pledged himself to a \"New Deal\" for the American people, which came in the form of a variety of aggressive economic recovery programs. While historians still debate the effectiveness of the various New Deal programs in terms of whether they fulfilled their stated objectives, it is generally undisputed that the New Deal greatly expanded the size and role of the US federal government. </p>\n <p>In December 1941, the Empire of Japan surprise attacked <b>Pearl Harbor</b>, a American military base in Hawaii, plunging the United States into <b>World War II</b>, a war which had already been raging in Europe for two years and in Asia since 1937. Joining the Allied Powers, the United States helped to defeat the Axis powers of <span>Italy</span>, <span>Germany</span>, and <span>Japan</span>. By the end of World War II, with much of Europe and Asia in ruins, the United States had firmly established itself as the dominant economic power in the world; it was then responsible for nearly half of the world's industrial production. The newly developed atomic bomb, whose power was demonstrated in two bombings of Japan in 1945, made the United States the only force capable of challenging the Communist Soviet Union, giving rise to what is now known as the <b>Cold War</b>. </p>\n <p>After World War II, America experienced an economic resurgence and growing affluence on a scale not seen since the 1920s. Meanwhile, the racism traditionally espoused in various explicit and implicit forms by the European-American majority against the country's African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, Native American, and other minority populations had become impossible to ignore. While the US was attempting to spread democracy and the rule of law abroad to counter the Soviet Union's support of authoritarian Communist governments, it found itself having to confront its own abysmal failure to provide the benefits of democracy and the rule of law to all of its own citizens. However, in the 1960s a <b>civil rights movement</b> emerged which eliminated some institutional discrimination against African-Americans and other ethnic minorities, particularly in the Southern states. A revived women's movement in the 1970s also led to wide-ranging changes in gender roles and perceptions in US society, including to a limited extent views on homosexuality and bisexuality. The more organized present-era US 'gay rights' movement first emerged in the late 1960s and early 70s. </p>\n <p>During the same period, in the final quarter of the 20th century, the United States underwent a slow but inexorable transition from an economy based on a mixture of heavy industry and labor-intensive agriculture, to an economy primarily based on advanced technology (the \"high-tech\" industry), retail, professional services, and other service industries, as well as a highly mechanized, automated agricultural industry. </p>\n <p>In the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, millions of US manufacturing jobs fell victim to outsourcing. In a phenomenon since labeled \"global labor arbitrage,\" revolutionary improvements in transportation, communications, and logistics technologies made it possible to relocate manufacturing of most goods to foreign factories which did not have to pay US minimum wages, observe US occupational safety standards, or allow the formation of unions. The outsourcing revolution was devastating to many cities, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast, whose economies were overly dependent upon manufacturing, and resulted in a group of hollowed-out, depressed cities now known as the <b>Rust Belt</b>. </p>\n <p>The United States also assumed and continues to maintain a position of global leadership in military and aerospace technology through the development of a powerful \"military-industrial complex\", although as of the turn of the 21st century, its leadership is increasingly being challenged by the European Union and China. US federal investments in military technology also paid off handsomely in the form of the most advanced information technology sector in the world, which is primarily centered on the area of Northern California known as Silicon Valley. US energy firms, especially those based in petroleum and natural gas, have also become global giants, as they expanded worldwide to feed the country's thirst for cheap energy. </p>\n <p>The 1950s saw the beginnings of a major shift of population from rural towns and urban cores to the suburbs. These population shifts, along with a changing economic climate, contributed heavily to <b>Urban decay</b> from the 1970s until the late 1990s. The postwar rise of a prosperous middle class able to afford cheap automobiles and cheap gasoline in turn led to the rise of the American car culture and the convenience of fast food restaurants. The <b>Interstate Highway System</b>, constructed primarily from the 1960s to the 1980s, became the most comprehensive freeway system in the world, at over 47,000 miles in length. It was surpassed by China only in 2011, although the US is believed to still have a larger freeway system when non-federal-aid highways are also included. </p>\n <p>In the late 20th century, the US was also a leader in the development and deployment of the modern passenger jetliner. This culminated in the development of the popular Boeing 737 and 747 jetliners; the 737 is still the world's most popular airliner today. Cheap air transportation together with cheap cars in turn devastated US passenger rail, although freight rail remained financially viable. In 1970, with the consent of the railroads, who were eager to focus their operations on carrying freight, Congress nationalized their passenger rail operations to form the government-owned corporation now known as Amtrak. </p>\n <p>During the 20th century, the US retail sector became the strongest in the world. US retailers were the first to pioneer many innovative concepts that later spread around the world, including self-service supermarkets, inventory bar codes to ease the tedium of accurately tallying purchases, \"big box\" chain stores, factory outlet stores, warehouse club stores, and modern shopping centers. American consumer culture, as well as Hollywood movies and many forms of popular music, books, and art, all combined to establish the United States as the cultural center of the world. American universities established themselves as the most prestigious academic institutions in the world, thanks to generous assistance from the federal government in the form of the GI Bill, followed by massive research and development investments by the military-industrial complex, and later, the Higher Education Act. Today, US universities are rivaled only by a handful of universities in the UK, mainland Europe, and Asia. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Government and politics</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The United States is a federal republic comprising 50 states, the District of Columbia (Washington DC), 16 territories, and numerous Indian Reservations. The federal government derives its power from the Constitution of the United States, the oldest written constitution in the world in continuous use. Although federal law supersedes state law in the event of an express or implied conflict (known in legal jargon as \"federal preemption\"), each state is considered to be a separate sovereign, maintains its own constitution and government, and retains considerable autonomy within the federation. State citizens enjoy the power to vote for federal representatives, federal senators, and the federal President. The United States has two major political parties, the Republicans and Democrats, that dominate American politics at all levels. Due to the winner-take-all electoral system, smaller \"third parties\" as they are known to Americans are rarely competitive in any elections at any level, and the Democrats and Republicans have won every single presidential election since 1848. The Republican and Democratic dominant leads to a heavily criticized and frequently corrupt system where necessary change is too-often subject to deadlock and bi-partisan point scoring. </p>\n <p>Americans value their rights to political expression strongly, and politics are fiercely debated in American society. In fact, there are many popular web sites and cable channels devoted primarily to political opinion programming. American politics are very complex and change quickly. For example, gay people were not allowed to marry in any US state as recently as 2003, whereas gay marriage is now legal in all 50 states since 2015. Many Americans hold and passionately defend strong opinions on a wide range of political issues, many Americans, especially older Americans, are loyal to one party, and political debates often become heated and lead to insults, vulgarities, and personal attacks being exchanged. <b>For these reasons, unless you are intimately familiar with American politics or already know and agree with the political views of the person you are talking to, you are best off not talking about politics at all!</b></p>\n <p>American elections are frequent and lengthy, especially the presidential election. Presidential elections in the United States last nearly two years, so there is a 50% chance that you will be visiting the United States in the midst of one. The November election is preceded by a six-month period from January to June wherein all 50 states, 5 overseas territories, and D.C. each vote one-by-one twice; one time to select the Republican nominee, and the other to select the Democratic nominee. One of these two nominees will be elected President in November. The current president is Donald Trump. He was elected in November 2016 and sworn in on January 2017. Federal elections for Congressional positions take place every two years in November. </p>\n <p>Compared to Western European Democracies, there are an extraordinary number of elected positions in the United States. On a single election day, there might be simultaneous elections for dozens of positions. Typically, the average American would be voting for school board members, city councilmen, mayors, deputy mayors, governors, state representatives, state senators, congressmen, senators, the president, and a number of other positions, such as tax assessor or coroner. </p>\n <p>The President of the United States is elected indirectly every four years and serves as the head of government and head of state. Each state is allocated electoral votes, and whichever candidate gets the most votes in a state get all of that state's electoral votes. Though rare, this means that a candidate can win the \"electoral vote\" and thus the presidency while gaining fewer popular votes than his opponent. Most recently, this happened in the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. </p>\n <p>The Congress is bicameral; the lower House of Representatives has seats assigned to the states proportionally, while the upper house, the Senate, comprises exactly two seats per state. </p>\n <p>By way of contrast, the District of Columbia and the overseas territories have limited federal representation, as they can only elect \"delegates\" to the federal House of Representatives who cannot participate in votes by the Committee of the Whole on the House floor. (D.C. does, however, get three electoral votes with respect to the election of the federal President.) Because they lack state sovereignty, the governments of D.C. and the territories exist at the mercy of the federal government, which theoretically could dissolve them at any time. </p>\n <p>The laws and legal systems of the U.S. will be complicated at best to understand and follow. State and territorial laws can vary widely from one jurisdiction to another, meaning that the US actually consists of at least 54 <i>separate</i> legal systems with regard to any area of law not within the purview of federal law. State and territorial laws are quite uniform in some areas (e.g., contracts for sales of goods) and extremely divergent in others (e.g., \"real estate,\" the American term for immovable property). If this was not confusing enough, sovereign Native American tribes are allowed to operate their <i>own</i> legal systems separate from both federal and state law. What's more, the U.S. federal government practices the use of <i>Federal Enclaves</i>. Which are pieces of land or properties owned by the Federal government under a agreement of the state or territory. A example are U.S. national forests. As Federal owned land and property, most state and territorial laws do not apply. Examples are state and territorial anti-discrimination, minimum wage, and criminal laws. While state and territorial laws such as juvenile delinquency, restraining order laws still apply. </p>\n <p>The federal government consists of the President of the United States and his administration acting as the executive branch, the United States Congress acting as the legislative branch, and the Supreme Court of the United States and lower federal courts acting as the judicial branch. State government structures are organized similarly, with governors, legislatures, and judiciaries. </p>\n <h3> <span>Culture</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/gqJqmo42wjgFSGVCzNREzXkU7nOf9RL7d4YD9hXKgiQzuXNFBwk=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/Ss_4exLbWZPntr3xhUuHBs4O56ZYAIuGk0yZVku0rq3yVf9dPfc=/upload/shared//thumb/4/4f/Bourbon_Street_New_Orleans_Louisiana_USA.jpg/300px-Bourbon_Street_New_Orleans_Louisiana_USA.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The South's famous Bourbon Street, <span>New Orleans</span>, <span>Louisiana</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The United States is made up of many diverse ethnic groups and its culture varies greatly across the vast area of the country and even within cities - a city like New York will have dozens, if not hundreds, of different ethnicities represented within a neighborhood. Despite this difference, there exists a strong sense of national identity and certain predominant cultural traits. Generally, Americans tend to believe strongly in personal responsibility and that an individual determines his or her own success or failure, but it is important to note that there are many exceptions and that a nation as diverse as the United States has literally thousands of distinct cultural traditions. One will find South Carolina in the South to be different culturally from New Hampshire in New England. </p>\n <h3> <span>Holidays</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The United States has a number of holidays — official and/or cultural — of which the traveler should be aware of. Note that holidays observed on Mondays or Fridays are usually treated as weekend-long events. (A weekend consists of a Saturday and a Sunday.) Federal holidays — i.e., holidays observed by the federal government, state and local government and banks — are indicated in <i><b>bold italics</b></i>. If a federal holiday with a fixed calendar date (such as Independence Day) falls on a weekend, federal and most state and local government offices will be closed on the nearest non-weekend day. Since the early 1970s, several federal holidays, including Memorial Day and Labor Day, have been observed on a certain Monday rather than on a fixed date for the express purpose of giving federal employees three-day weekends. Foreign embassies &amp; consulates in the U.S. also observe the same federal holidays (in bold italics) in addition to the official holidays of their respective countries. The private sector (besides banks) are usually open for business on most holidays with people working except New Years, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, the Friday after Thanksgiving and Christmas when a vast number of non-retail businesses do close or open partial hours in observance. </p>\n <p>Due to the number of major holidays in close proximity to each other, many Americans refer to the period between Thanksgiving in late November and New Year's Day as simply \"the holidays.\" School and work vacations are commonly taken during this periods: </p>\n <p>From a foreign traveler's point of view, there are two major services affected by federal holidays: visas and mail. </p>\n <p>First, if you are a foreigner who needs to apply for a US visa, it is important to note the federal holidays marked in <i>bold italics</i>. All US embassies worldwide close on those days, in addition to the official holidays of the host country and are unable to process applications on those days. </p>\n <p>Second, United States Postal Service retail counters are closed on federal holidays, and in high-crime areas, the entire post office stays closed. Self-service kiosks at post offices in relatively safe areas with 24/7 lobby access remain operational through holidays. However, mail deposited at a post office or in a mailbox will not be processed until after the holiday is over. </p>\n <p>Other federal services like national parks and airport security operate 365 days a year regardless of federal holidays. </p>\n <p>Many state governments also observe official holidays of their own which are not observed in other states or by the federal government. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Units of measure</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The United States is the only industrialized country that has still not adopted metric units of measure in daily life (it still uses the customary English units that were in use prior to the revolution, similar to the later British imperial system, but typically with smaller units as one of the major differences), except for scientific, engineering, medical, and military applications. </p>\n <p>All road signs and speed limits are posted in miles and miles per hour respectively. Automotive fuel is priced and sold per gallon, which is 128 fluid ounces, 80% of the size of an Imperial/UK gallon. Other capacities of liquid products are normally quoted and sold per gallon, quart, or ounce (although liters are often indicated and sometimes exclusively used, as with some soda, wine, and other liquor products). Temperatures are reported in Fahrenheit only; 32 degrees (with units unspecified) is the temperature at which water freezes (equivalent to 0 degrees Celsius). The good news is that most cars on the road in the US have both mph and km/h marked on their speedometers (good for trips to Canada and Mexico), and almost all groceries and household items sold in stores are labeled in both systems. The vast majority of Americans, though, have little day-to-day exposure to the metric system (apart from having studied it a little in school) and will assume some understanding of customary measures. </p>\n <p>In addition, the US government does not regulate apparel or shoe sizes. Although there are informal standard sizes, they are not strictly enforced. The only thing you can count on is that sizes tend to be consistent within the same brand. If you plan to shop for apparel or shoes, you will have to do some trial-and-error for <i>each</i> brand to determine what fits, because you <i>cannot</i> rely on any brand's sizes as equivalent to another's. Please note that, as the average body size of Americans tends to be larger than that of those living in other countries, a concept known as vanity sizing (the labeling of larger garments with smaller sizes) exists in many clothing retailers, especially those aimed at women. It is very possible for people with smaller body types to have some difficulty finding suitably sized clothing. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Electricity</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <dl no-attr=empty><dd>For more information: <span>Electrical systems</span> </dd></dl> <p>Electricity in the United States is provided to consumers in the form of 120V, 60Hz alternating current, through wall outlets that take NEMA 1 or NEMA 5 plugs. (NEMA stands for National Electrical Manufacturers Association.) NEMA 1 plugs have two flat, blunt blades (don't worry, they're not sharp), one of which may or may not be polarized (slightly larger than the other), to ensure that the hot and neutral blades are inserted correctly for devices for which that matters. NEMA 5 plugs add a round grounding pin below the blades. All US buildings constructed or renovated after the early 1960s are required to have three-hole outlets that accept the two blades and one pin of NEMA 5 plugs, as well as both polarized and unpolarized NEMA 1 two-blade plugs. The US Virgin Islands uses a slightly lower voltage of 110V. American Samoa uses US plugs, the German Schuko plug, and the Australian standard plug. </p>\n <p>All of North America, nearly all of the Caribbean and Central America, Venezuela, and Taiwan follow US standards for electricity and plugs. If you are arriving from outside of those areas, you will need to verify whether your electrical devices are compatible with US electricity and plugs. Japan uses the same plugs as the US, but has a unique standard of 100V with frequency of either 50 or 60Hz depending on region. Most of the rest of the world uses 220-230V at 50Hz, for the simple reason that they began large-scale electrification at much later dates than the US and after wire insulation technology had significantly advanced. This meant they could select a higher voltage and lower frequency, which required less conductor material (meaning less use of expensive metals) but at the expense of more insulation and larger, more heavily insulated plugs. Colombia's voltage is 110V and Ecuador's 120-127V but the frequency is the same as the US. </p>\n <p>Most consumer electronics, computers, and shavers are already designed as \"dual voltage\" devices capable of accepting voltages from 110V up to 230V and between 50-60Hz. For those devices, a plug adapter is sufficient. Purchase your adapter at home before you depart. Most US stores carry adapters designed to adapt NEMA plugs to other countries' outlets, not the other way around. </p>\n <p>The differences in voltage and frequency are most frequently an issue for travellers with hair long enough to require the use of a hair dryer for proper hair care. Foreign visitors regularly find their hair dryers to be starved for power in the US; conversely, Americans' hair dryers are regularly burned out and destroyed by high voltages overseas. Apart from doing without or waiting an annoying long time to dry one's hair, the solutions are to either </p>\n <ol no-attr=empty> <li>buy a high-wattage transformer capable of stepping up 120V to 220V</li>\n <li>buy a hair dryer with a switch that allows it to be switched between 110 and 220V</li>\n <li>buy a cheap US hair dryer for use during your trip; or </li>\n <li>book hotels that cater to international travellers and place hair dryers in the rooms for this reason.</li>\n </ol> <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>For more information</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The US federal government sets foreign policy, while the states deal with tourism. As such, the federal government provides the best information about legal requirements for entry, while information about places to visit and see is best provided by state and local tourism bureaus. Contact information is available in the individual state articles. At state borders, highway rest stops sometimes feature visitor centers and often offer travel and tourism information and materials, almost all of which is also available on-line or can be requested in advance by mail. Nearly every rest stop has a posted road map with a clearly indicated \"You Are Here\" marker. Some also offer free paper road maps to take with you. </p>\n <p>Note that government tourism bureaus and their Web sites tend to be rather indiscriminate in their recommendations, since for political reasons they cannot be seen as overly favorable towards any particular area within their jurisdiction. </p>\n <h2> <span>Regions</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <p>The United States is composed of 50 <b>states</b>, various overseas territories, as well as the city of <span>Washington, D.C.</span>, a federal district and the nation's capital.

All travelers must disembark and proceed through immigration and customs inspection to enter the United States at first port entry, even if you're only staying for the two to four hours needed to transit between flights. This is most relevant if you're transiting between Asia or Europe to/from Latin America. Therefore, all travelers must be able to enter the United States on the Visa Waiver Program (or other visa exemption) or obtain a visitor's (B1 or B2) or transit (C1) visa.

The CBP's Office of Field Operations operates 20 Field Operations offices which supervise immigration and customs inspection stations at over 320 ports of entry. All travelers entering the United States must undergo immigration and customs inspection to ensure lawful entry. All US citizens and nationals and visitors who can qualify for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) (as explained further below) generally encounter only CBP officers. </p>\n <p>If you cannot enter the US through the VWP, you must visit a US Embassy or Consulate to apply for and obtain a visa, which will require a short visa interview with a US consular officer. </p>\n <p>If you attempt to unlawfully cross a US land border at any other point besides a port of entry, you may encounter the U.S. Border Patrol, which is also part of CBP. </p>\n <p>If you attempt to unlawfully come ashore in the US from a body of water at any other point besides a port of entry, you may encounter the U.S. Coast Guard, which is normally part of DHS (but can operate as part of the Department of Defense in wartime). </p>\n <p>Finally, if you unlawfully enter the US, commit a severe crime in the US, or overstay your visa, you will likely encounter officers from the division of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), another DHS bureau. ICE operates a system of immigration detention facilities.

Take care if transiting through the US on a trip exceeding 90 days to Canada and/or Mexico. </p>\n <p>Travelers entering the US under the VWP and arriving by air or sea <b>must</b> apply for <b>Electronic System for Travel Authorization</b> (ESTA) approval <a target=_blank href=https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">on-line</a> before travel, preferably 72 hours before travel. An ESTA approval is valid for two years (unless your passport expires earlier) and <b>costs $14</b> (payable by credit card). If granted, it allows the traveler to commence their journey to the US but (as with any visa or entry permit) it does not guarantee entry. </p>\n <p>Entry under the Visa Waiver Program by air or sea also requires that you are using a signatory carrier. It is a fairly safe assumption that commercial scheduled services to the US will be fine, but if you are on a chartered flight or vessel you should check the status of the carrier, as you may require a visa. </p>\n <p>Travelers entering by air or sea must also have a return/onward ticket out of the United States. If the return/onward ticket terminates in Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, or any Caribbean island, the traveler must be a legal resident of that country/territory. If travelling by land, there is a $7.00 fee when crossing the border. </p>\n <p>A criminal record, including arrests, will generally make a potential traveler ineligible for visa-free travel with the following exceptions: </p>\n <p>The ESTA application contains a questionnaire, which if answered truthfully will direct you to apply to a visa if you are ineligible for the Visa Waiver Program for reasons of criminal history, etc. If you have any concerns, complete the ESTA application well in advance of your departure to allow time to apply for a visa if directed to do so. </p>\n <p>Effective as of 2016, any person who is a citizen of both a VWP country and of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria, or a citizen of a <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.estavisaus.org/esta-questions/visa-waiver-program>VWP</a> country and who has visited any of those four countries since March 2011 is <i>ineligible</i> to enter the United States under the Visa Waiver Program. </p>\n <p>There are disadvantages and restrictions to entering under the Visa Waiver Program.

This fee is sometimes waived under very limited circumstances, namely for people requesting certain exchange visitor visas. </p>\n <p>Under US law, all persons requesting entry as non-immigrants are presumed to be immigrants (that is, trying to permanently migrate) until they overcome that presumption by presenting evidence of \"binding ties\" to their home country as well as sufficient proof that the visit will be temporary. To obtain a visa, face-to-face interviews at the nearest US embassy or consulate are required for nearly all nationalities. When the US rejects a visa application, it is usually because the applicant did not show enough binding ties to his or her home country to convince the consular officer that they will not try to overstay their visa. Since waits for interview slots and visa processing can add up to several months, you must start researching how to obtain a visa well in advance of your planned departure date. If you do not live close to a US consulate, you will need to set aside a day (or two) to travel to the closest consulate for the visa interview. </p>\n <p>For <b>technical and scientific fields</b> of work or study, processing a non-immigrant visa application can take up to 70 days, as it can require eight weeks to receive approval from authorities in Washington. This especially applies to military and dual-purpose fields which are mentioned in a so-called <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=https://www.bu.edu/isso/forms/tal.pdf>technical alert list</a>. </p>\n <p>Note that a visa does not guarantee entry into the US. It only authorizes you to proceed to a port of entry and request admission. Be sure you apply for the right visa for your visit. Applying for the incorrect/inappropriate visa may lead to serious legal problems, as well as a possible indefinite bar from obtaining any US visa. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/baNcMNj88281JGaaeUHS3qXueSunfXoFBrsAhdXJyotTOZBtKiI=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/zh2AQKgoFHxnlCDKlKDmUFsWKjzfnXNYIDK5PmpCsF95A1aeKW8=/upload/shared//thumb/e/e8/Statueofliberty.jpg/300px-Statueofliberty.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Statue of Liberty, <span>New York City</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Travel to US possessions</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>The territories of <span>Guam</span>, <span>Puerto Rico</span>, the <span>US Virgin Islands</span> and the <span>Northern Mariana Islands</span> all have the same entry requirements as the 50 states.

Citizens of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, and the United Kingdom are also allowed entry under the Guam-CNMI VWP and may enter either under that or the federal VWP. Entrance under the Guam-CNMI VWP requires a valid, machine-readable passport and evidence of a return airfare, and is limited to a 45-day stay in Guam and the CNMI <b>only</b>. Residents of Hong Kong must present a valid HK permanent identity card and are allowed entry with either a Hong Kong S.A.R. passport or British National (Overseas) passport. Residents of Taiwan must present a valid R.O.C. National Identification Card in addition to an R.O.C. passport. Citizens of Russia are eligible for parole (essentially the same as visa-free travel) to enter the Northern Marianas Islands only. Because of differences in entry requirements, a full immigration check is done when traveling between Guam and the CNMI as well as on flights to the rest of the US (currently, only Guam-Hawaii flights). </p>\n <p>Despite not being part of the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program, citizens of Russia can enter both territories Guam-CNMI visa-free under the waiver program, as long as they are in possession of a machine-readable passport, a completed Form I-736 (Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Information form) and Form I-94 (Arrival-Departure Record) and a non-refundable and non-transferable return ticket. </p>\n <p>Citizens of China will need a visa to enter Guam, but not one to enter the Northern Mariana Islands.

However, a entry permit will be issued upon arrival. Entry requirements are somewhat different for Americans with US citizenship.

For visitors travelling under the Visa Waiver Program arriving by air, the I-94W has now been replaced by the electronic ESTA system; therefore the form is not required. Again, remember that the ESTA approval is in essence, a <i>permit to travel</i> - not a guarantee of entry, hence there is no need to produce a copy of it at passport control - had there been any problems you would have been denied boarding at your origin airport, however most travelers tend to keep a copy of it in their possession anyway, just in case. </p>\n <p>I-94 forms are now used primarily at land ports of entry. As October 2013, the I-94 paper form is now optional for virtually all visitors arriving by common carrier at air and sea ports of entry. CBP now has arrangements in place to electronically receive manifest information directly from all major common carriers. From the manifests, CBP's computers create and maintain electronic I-94 records for all passengers who are foreign visitors. CBP operates <a target=_blank href=https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">a Web site</a> where visitors may view their own electronic I-94 record while they are still in the United States. </p>\n <p>When you reach a CBP immigration checkpoint, you will undergo a short interview if you are not a citizen or resident of the United States. A CBP officer will attempt to determine if the purpose of your visit is valid. Usually, the determination of admissibility is made in a minute or less. </p>\n <p>Otherwise, you may be referred to further questioning in a more private area. At that stage the CBP officers will likely search your possessions, and may read any documents, letters or diaries found in your possession. <i>Do not</i> bring anything that could imply you intend to permanently immigrate or otherwise violate the terms of your visa. For example, you should not be carrying work-related or sales materials if you are entering on a tourist visa. If you are unable to convince the CBP officers that you will abide by the terms of your visa (or VWP ESTA authorization if applicable), it can be cancelled on the spot, and you will be denied entry. </p>\n <p>Like immigration,customs and law enforcement officials everywhere, CBP officials take all security threats seriously.Making any joke could result in a lenghty interrogation, prison sentence or turned back to your country of origin. </p>\n <p>For non-residents, your entry forms will need to state the <b>street address</b> of the location where you will be staying for the first night. This should be arranged in advance. The name of your hotel, hostel, university, etc. is not sufficient; you must provide the street name and number. </p>\n <p>Once you are admitted, the departure portion of your I-94 or I-94W will be stapled to your passport (if you were required to fill it out). <b>Keep it safe</b> as you will need to give it CBP upon departure from the US. In the alternative, even if you weren't required to fill out a I-94, the CBP officer will place an admission stamp in your passport which shows that you were admitted to the United States under a certain class and until a certain date. </p>\n <p>For most travellers entering on visitor status (B1 or B2), you will normally be granted permission to stay for up to <i>six months</i>. Travellers entering under the VWP will receive permission to remain for <i>90 days only</i>. If you enter under a student (F) or exchange visitor (J) status, your permitted duration of stay will normally be indicated as <i>D/S</i>, which means \"permitted to remain provided status as a student/exchange visitor is maintained\". </p>\n <h4> <span>At customs</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>All travelers entering the US (including US citizens, nationals, and permanent residents) must fill out the Customs Declaration form, CBP Form 6059B, a blue-colored form in the shape of a tall narrow rectangle. It used to be distributed on the plane, but some airlines now hand it out at check-in for flights to the US. Many airports now have electronic kiosks that have replaced the physical Customs Declaration form. You still must answer the same questions as you would on the traditional form, but instead the machine will print out a receipt that you will present along with your passport to the customs agent. </p>\n <p>If you are traveling with family members, then only one form per family is required to be filled out. Normally, the head of the family is responsible for ensuring the declaration is accurate. </p>\n <p>The Customs Declaration form asks you to declare whether you are bringing with you a variety of heavily regulated items, such as more than USD10,000 in cash. In addition, you must list on the back side all goods that you are permanently bringing into the US and leaving there (such as foreign gifts for US-based friends and family). The Form 6059B is notorious for not having enough space on the back, so ask for and fill out multiple forms if you have many items to declare. </p>\n <p>After you are admitted into the US and retrieve your bags from the baggage claim, you will proceed to the secondary inspection area (the customs checkpoint), regardless of whether your journey terminates at this airport or if you are transiting onward via another flight. Hand your customs declaration to the officer. Most of the time, the officer will point you to the exit and that will be it. </p>\n <p>Sometimes, the officer may ask you a few routine questions and then let you go. The officer may refer you to an adjacent X-ray machine to have your bags inspected or may refer you for a manual hand search of your bags. Any search more intrusive than a bag search is rare and is usually indicated only if some sort of probable cause has been established through questioning or during the bag search to suggest suspicious activity. </p>\n <p>Note that you can't bring meat or raw fruit or vegetables, but you may bring cooked non-meat packaged foods, such as bread, cookies, and other baked goods. See <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=https://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/clearing_goods/agri_prod_inus.xml>APHIS</a> for details. The US Customs process is straightforward. Most articles that are prohibited or restricted in any other country are prohibited or restricted in the US. One rule that is unique to America is that it is generally prohibited to bring in goods made in countries on which the US has imposed economic sanctions such as Cuba, <span>Iran</span>, <span>North Korea</span> (DPRK) and <span>Syria</span>. </p>\n <p>The US possessions of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas Islands, and the US Virgin Islands are all outside federal customs jurisdiction. Each imposes their own separate requirements. Travel between these regions and the rest of the US requires a customs inspection. There are some differences (mostly larger) in duty exemptions for US citizens returning from these destinations. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>After customs</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>As noted above, all inbound citizens, nationals, and visitors must pass through immigration and customs at their first point of entry, regardless of whether they have onward connections to other destinations inside or outside the US or not. Many major airports have special arrangements for travellers with connecting flights such as a bag drop, check-in counter or security checkpoint just for the use of connecting passengers (you will need to re-clear security because you had access to your bags while passing through customs) upon coming out from customs inspection. Some airports do not, meaning that you will need to proceed to the main check-in desks with other departing passengers. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Closed cities</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/gx8XzSYOmy9yb8TCXa_drduqVtvTmUug3i-Pj_tob1TQkPhQXrs=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/3_T-HNcr6qNXCpSsEnju6q7jC5L1P0lNqAp470MY7ShwdPmcG9STCKkX1-k=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/NTS_-_Mercury.jpg/390px-NTS_-_Mercury.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The closed-off town of Mercury</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>If you managed to get into the United States visa-free or not, if you plan on visiting rural <span>Nevada</span>, be careful on where you are.

In addition, overstaying your authorized stay or violating the conditions will make it extremely difficult to re-enter the United States for any purpose, and this may, in some cases, bar you from re-entry for at least three years, if not permanently. If you entered under the Visa Waiver Program but overstayed, you will <b>need a visa</b> for <b>all</b> future visits. Even if you did not technically overstay each of your visits, if officers suspect or detect a pattern with your previous visits/travel history that suggests you are in fact spending more time in the US than your home country (e.g. you leave the US only to return there a few weeks later), you may also face severe questioning the next time you arrive. </p>\n </td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n <p><br>\n</p>\n <p><b>Unlike most countries, the US does not provide formal passport control checkpoints for those exiting the country.</b> This used to be a big problem for many tourists who left by air or sea, but is not a major issue any more.

While many medium-sized inland cities have an international airport, there are limited flights to most of them. Most travellers enter the US at one of the major entry points along the coasts: </p>\n <p>Luggage allowance for flights to or from the US usually operates on a piecewise system in addition to the weight system even for foreign carriers. This means that you are allowed a limited number of bags to check-in where <b>each</b> bag should not exceed certain linear dimensions (computed by adding the length, width and height of the bags). The exact allowances and restrictions on weight, linear dimension and number of baggage allowed are determined by the carrier you are flying with, your origin (if coming to the US) or destination (if leaving the US) and the class of service you are traveling in. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Airport security</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>International flights bound for the United States tend to feature extremely strict security. Besides going through a regular security search to enter the departure area of the airport terminal, it was standard up until 2015 at many airports to have an additional layer of security around waiting areas for gates for US-bound flights with a secondary security checkpoint of its own. While that kind of security is no longer seen at many airports, all airlines with US-bound flights continue to carefully inspect all documents at time of boarding. Passengers may be selected for the Secondary Security Screening Selection (or \"SSSS\"), which randomly selects passengers on inbound flights to the US (although it is applied to internal flights also) for additional security screening. Passengers are typically stopped at the jetway prior to boarding, and their carry on bags are hand searched, portable electronic devices must be charged and powered on for inspection, and shoes/socks will be swabbed. The first sign that this may happen to you is that an electronic boarding pass will be denied, or you will be referred to an agent if you use a self check-in machine at the airport. If the letters \"SSSS\" are printed on your boarding card when you eventually get it, then it means you have been selected - so be prepared for the additional screening. </p>\n <p>Within the US, airport security procedures continue to evolve. The <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.tsa.gov><b>TSA</b></a> (Transportation Security Administration) now requires all passengers to remove shoes and outerwear (coats and jackets) and submit those items along with all personal belongings to X-ray screening. Laptops and large cameras must be removed from bags and scanned separately. </p>\n <p>Full body scanning x-ray machines are now in use at many US airports, which are capable of detecting many non-metallic threats. Because of early problems with displaying far too much detail at security checkpoints to the embarrassment of travelers, the scanners were subsequently modified so that a fully detailed image is displayed only at a remote analysis center. The off-site screener marks rectangles on a generic diagram corresponding to any portions of a traveler's body that look unusual. Only that marked-up diagram is displayed at the checkpoint, thereby enabling TSA officers to focus any necessary pat-down on those areas. If there is nothing suspicious on the scan, the off-site screener sends an \"OK\" message authorizing the traveler to proceed. </p>\n <p>The full body scanners are optional and passengers have the legal right to \"opt out\" and request a manual search instead. Furthermore, passengers may also be randomly selected for additional screening, such as an \"enhanced pat-down.\" Do not assume that you are in any sort of trouble or that you are even suspected of causing trouble, simply because you are being subjected to these further screenings. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Pre-clearance</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>Passengers whose journeys originate in major Canadian airports and involve either US or Canadian carriers will have the advantage of clearing US entry formalities (passport control and customs) at their Canadian port-of-exit. As far as most flights from Canada are concerned, they are treated similarly as US domestic flights but only because clearance has been performed at the Canadian airport. Hence once passengers from Canada arrive at their US port-of-entry, rather than walk through a secluded corridor, they can see the display of restaurants and shops at the domestic terminal on their way to baggage claim. It is worth noting that most Canadian carriers are located in US domestic terminals. </p>\n <p>Take note that passengers on US-Canadian flights operated by foreign air carriers will still see traditional entry formalities upon arrival at their US port-of-entry; a Canadian transit visa may be required even if passengers are confined to a holding area for the entire transit time. </p>\n <p>Some airports in Canada, including <span>Vancouver</span> International Airport, Terminal 1 of <span>Toronto</span>-Pearson Airport, and <span>Montréal</span>-Trudeau Airport generally do not require passengers in transit from abroad to pass through Canadian Customs and Immigration controls before going through US pre-clearance formalities. However, even if you pass through these airports, make sure that your papers are in order to allow you to enter Canada. If you cannot travel to the US on the same day you go through pre-clearance, if you are not cleared for entry to the United States, <i>or</i> if you and/or your luggage is not checked through by your airline to at least your first destination in the United States, you will need to report to Canada Customs, and in that event, a Canadian transit or temporary resident visa may be required. </p>\n <p>Pre-clearance facilities are available at most major Canadian airports (Toronto-Pearson, Montreal-Trudeau, <span>Ottawa</span> Macdonald-Cartier, Vancouver, <span>Calgary</span>, etc.), Queen Beatrix International Airport in <span>Aruba</span>, <span>Grand Bahama</span> and Lynden Pindling International Airports in the <span>Bahamas</span>, Bermuda International Airport in <span>Bermuda</span>, <span>Dublin</span> and <span>Shannon</span> International Airports in <span>Ireland</span>, and <span>Abu Dhabi</span> International Airport in the <span>United Arab Emirates</span>. </p>\n <p>Passengers on British Airways flights from <span>London</span> to New York City transiting via either Dublin or Shannon, Ireland can take advantage of US passport control and customs pre-clearance at Dublin or Shannon.

Average wait times are up to 30 minutes, but some of the most heavily traveled border crossings may have considerable delays—approaching 1-2 hours at peak times (weekends, holidays). Current wait times (updated hourly) are available on the <a target=_blank href=http://apps.cbp.gov/bwt/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">US customs service website</a>. The US-Mexico border is vulnerable to high levels of drug trafficking, so vehicles crossing may be X-rayed or searched by a drug-sniffing dog. If anything about you appears suspicious, you and your vehicle may be searched. Since this is an all-too-common event, expect no patience or sympathy from border agents. </p>\n <p>As Canada and Mexico use the metric units of measure but the US uses customary units, bear in mind that after the border, road signs are published in miles and miles per hour. Therefore, if you are driving a car from Canada or Mexico, be mindful that a speed limit of 55mph in the US is 88km/h. </p>\n <h3> <span>By bus</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Greyhound offers many inexpensive cross-border services from both Canada and Mexico throughout their network.

Coast-to-coast travel takes about six hours from east to west, and five hours from west to east (varying due to winds), compared to the three or four days necessary for land transportation. Most cities in the US are served by one or two airports; many small towns also have some passenger air service, although you may need to detour through a major hub airport to get there. Depending on where you are starting, it may be cheaper to drive to a nearby large city and fly or, conversely, to fly to a large city near your destination and rent a car. </p>\n <p>Major carriers compete for business on major routes, and travelers willing to book two or more weeks in advance can get bargains.

Round-trip fares can run over a thousand dollars, even for short flights, making the added cost not worth it for the vast majority of travelers. (Most travelers in first class get their seat as a complimentary frequent flier upgrade or similar perk.)

Their regional allies, specializing in operating smaller planes, would run feeder routes into the parent's hubs that would enable passengers from small towns to connect to the parent's long-distance routes; conversely, the regional airlines would enable passengers coming off the parent's long-distance routes to easily connect to outlying small towns rather than exiting at a hub airport and completing the rest of the journey by car, bus, or train. </dd> <dd>Regional airlines tend to have a mediocre safety record. They often hire desperate pilots who are eager to break into a career in commercial aviation but for whatever reason could not qualify for or did not want to earn their flight hours in the US military. Regional pilots thus tend to work for low pay and long hours in the hope of building sufficient flight experience to apply for and get a decent-paying job as the pilot of a full-size jetliner with the regional subsidiary's parent legacy airline. As a result, there have been a number of crashes or near-misses blamed upon low-paid, overworked regional pilots. </dd> <dd>They are operated by <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.skywest.com>SkyWest</a>; <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.mesa-air.com>Mesa Air Group</a>; <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.midwestairlines.com>Republic</a>; and <a target=_blank href=http://www.expressjet.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Express Jet</a> as United Express, Delta Connection, American Eagle/Envoy, Alaska Airlines, Frontier, and/or US Airways Express. They operate one or several brands of the bigger 'legacy' parent(s) at the same time.

This is true whether you directly check the carrier's website or an online travel agency like Orbitz. Unlike carriers in other foreign countries, most US carriers do not explicitly impose a fuel surcharge. However, carriers charge for extra services, especially mainline/legacy ones. Here is a run down of services that may incur additional fees, as well as strategies for avoiding them if they aren't a service you need or want. Even baggage fees can be avoided with careful planning: </p>\n <p>Most mainline carriers feature \"cashless cabins\" meaning any on-board purchases must be paid with either Visa or MasterCard (Delta also accepts American Express). Regional subsidiaries generally do still accept cash on-board, although flight attendants may not be able break large bills - hence the traditional request \"exact change is appreciated.\" If you paid in advance for first class, checked baggage, meals, and alcoholic beverages are all included with the price of your ticket, as well as priority access to check-in agents, lounge access and boarding. </p>\n <p>Ironically, America's discount airlines, such as JetBlue, Southwest, and Virgin America sometimes have more amenities than the legacy carriers, and for many people may be a much better experience. Jet Blue offers over 45 channels of satellite television, non-alcoholic beverages and real snacks for free on every flight; Virgin America also has satellite TV, in addition to on demand dining (even in economy). On Jet Blue your first checked bag is free ($35 for a second bag), and Southwest is the only U.S. carrier to still offer two checked bags per passenger free of charge. Virgin America charges for checked bags, but their fees are considerably lower than the legacies. </p>\n <p>See <span>Cheap airline travel in North America</span>. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Security concerns</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>Security at US airports is known to be onerous, especially during busy holiday travel periods. Allow plenty of time and pack as lightly as possible. Ensure the amount of liquids you bring does not exceed the prescribed limit and is properly placed in the prescribed containers. Currently those limits are referred to as '311' - 3 ounces or less liquid bottles placed in one single, transparent, resealable plastic bag that is 1 quart (1 litre) or less in size. Please note that you can take as many of the little \"travel size\" 3-ounce (100 ml) bottles that you can cram into that single bag. The little bottles of shampoo and conditioner provided in the rooms at most decent hotels are perfect for this. Many pharmacies, as well as Wal-Mart, Target, and most major grocery stores have a section for \"trial or travel size\" bottles of personal care liquids that fall under the three-ounce limit. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>By private plane</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>The cost of chartering the smallest private jet begins at around $4,000 per flight hour, with the cost substantially higher for larger, longer-range aircraft, and cheaper for smaller propeller planes. While private flying is by no means inexpensive, a family of four or more can often fly together at a cost similar to or even favorable to buying first class commercial airline tickets, especially to smaller airports where scheduled commercial flights are at their most expensive, and private flying is at its cheapest. Though you may find it cheaper than flying a family of four first class internationally, it is rarely the case, except when traveling from Western Europe. </p>\n <p><b>Air Charter</b> refers to hiring a private plane for a one time journey. <b>Jet Cards</b> are pre-paid cards entitling the owner to a specific number of flight hours on a specified aircraft. As all expenses are pre-paid on the card, you need not to concern yourself with deadhead time, return flights, landing fees, etc. </p>\n <h3> <span>By train</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p><i>See also: <span>Rail travel in the United States</span></i></p>\n <h4> <span>Amtrak</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>Except for certain densely populated corridors (mostly near and between the big cities of the Northeast), passenger trains in the United States can be surprisingly scarce and relatively expensive. The national rail system, <a target=_blank href=http://www.amtrak.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Amtrak</a> (1-800-USA-RAIL), provides service to many cities, offering exceptional sightseeing opportunities, but not particularly efficient inter-city travel, and is often just as expensive as a flight. In more urban locations, Amtrak can be very efficient and comfortable, but in rural areas delays are common. Plan ahead to ensure train travel between your destinations is available and/or convenient. They have promotional discounts of 15% for students and seniors, and a 30-day U.S. Rail Pass for international travelers only. If you plan to buy a regular ticket within a week of travelling, it pays to check the website for sometimes significant \"weekly specials\". </p>\n <p>Amtrak offers many amenities and services that are lacking from other modes of transport. Amtrak offers many routes that traverse some of America's most beautiful areas. Travelers with limited time may not find travel by train to be convenient, simply because the country is <i>big</i>, and the \"bigness\" is particularly evident in many of the scenic areas. For those with ample time, though, train travel offers an unparalleled view of the U.S., without the trouble and long-term discomfort of a rental (hire) car or the hassle of flying. </p>\n <p>Trains running on the Washington D.C. to Boston <b>Northeast Corridor</b> (Acela Express and the Regional) and the Philadelphia to Harrisburg <b>Keystone Corridor</b> (Keystone Service and Pennsylvanian) generally run on time or very close to it. These two rail lines are electrified and owned by Amtrak or other commuter railways and are passenger only. Outside these two areas, Amtrak operates on freight lines and as a result must share track with freight trains hosted by host railroads. This means you have about as good a chance of a delay as not. While these delays are usually brief (trains make up time en route), <b>have a contingency plan for being at least three hours late when travelling Amtrak</b>. In fact, six hour or longer delays, especially on long-distance routes, are not uncommon, either. </p>\n <p>If you miss an Amtrak connection because your first train is late, Amtrak will book you onto the next available train (or in rare cases a bus) to your final destination. If your destination is on the Northeast Corridor, this isn't a big deal (departures are every hour) but in other parts of the country the next train may not be until tomorrow. If your reservations involved sleeper accommodations (Amtrak's First Class on their long-distance overnight trains) on either your late-arriving train or your missed connection, you will get a hotel voucher for the unplanned overnight stay. For coach class passengers in the same situation, you will not get a hotel voucher; your unplanned lodging arrangements and cost will be your responsibility. However, after your travel is completed, Amtrak's Customer Service will commonly offer travel vouchers of $100 or more off future Amtrak travel to inconvenienced passengers. This is true for all classes of service. </p>\n <p>If you plan to board an Amtrak train at a location other than the train's initial place of departure, it's usually a good idea to call ahead before you leave for the station to see if the train is running on time. </p>\n <p>A major Amtrak line in regular daily use by Americans is the <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=AM_Route_C&pagename=am%2FLayout&cid=1241245664867\">Acela Express</a> line, running between Boston and Washington, D.C. It stops in New York City, <span>New Haven</span>, Philadelphia and many other cities on the way. Acela Express is electrified, with top speeds of 150 miles per hour (though the average speed is a good deal slower because many track sections have curves too tight to be safely traversed at more than 90mph). The Acela Express features comfortable first class intercity service, but can be quite expensive. Given the difficulty and expense of getting from the center of some of the major Northeastern cities to their respective airports, trains can sometimes be more convenient than air travel. There are also frequent but much slower regional trains covering the same stations along the Northeast Corridor for lower fares. </p>\n <p>During usual American vacation times, some long-distance trains (outside the Northeast) can sell out weeks or even months in advance, so it pays to book early if you plan on using the long-distance trains. Booking early also results in generally lower fares for all trains since they tend to increase as trains become fuller. On the other hand, same-day reservations are usually easy, and depending on the rules of the fare you purchased, you can change travel plans on the day itself without fees. </p>\n <p>One major scenic long-distance train route, the <i>California Zephyr</i>, runs from <span>Emeryville</span> in the <span>Bay Area</span> of <span>California</span> to <span>Chicago</span>, via <span>Reno</span>, <span>Salt Lake City</span> and <span>Denver</span>. The full trip takes around 60 hours, but has incredible views of the Western deserts, the <span>Rocky Mountains</span>, and the <span>Great Plains</span>, things that you just cannot see if you fly. Many of the sights on this route are simply inaccessible to cars. The trains run only once per day, and they usually sell out well in advance. </p>\n <p>Amtrak's single most popular long-distance train is the Chicago-Seattle/Portland \"Empire Builder\" train via <span>Milwaukee</span>, <span>St. Paul/Minneapolis</span>, <span>Fargo</span>, <span>Minot</span>, <span>Glacier National Park</span>, <span>Whitefish</span>, and <span>Spokane</span>. In the 2007 fiscal year, this train alone carried over 503,000 passengers. </p>\n <p>Amtrak also provides reasonably speedy daily round trips between <span>Seattle</span> and <span>Vancouver, Canada</span> and several daily trips between <span>Seattle</span> and <span>Eugene</span>, <span>Oregon</span> on the <i>Amtrak Cascades</i> line. </p>\n <p>Passengers travelling long distances on Amtrak may reserve a seat in coach (Economy class) or pay extra for an upgrade to a private sleeping compartment (there are no shared rooms), which also includes all meals in the dining car. Amtrak trains in the West feature a lounge car with floor to ceiling windows, which are perfect for sightseeing. </p>\n <p>Bradt's <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.usa-by-rail.com>USA by Rail</a> book (ISBN 9781841623894) is a guide to all Amtrak routes, with maps, station details and other practical advice. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Local trains</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>Separate from Amtrak, many major cities offer very reliable <b>commuter trains</b> that carry passengers to and from the suburbs or other relatively close-by areas. Since most Americans use a car for suburban travel, some commuter train stations have park and ride facilities where you can park your car for the day to use the commuter train to get to a city's downtown core where it may be more difficult to use a car due to traffic and parking concerns. Parking rates at the commuter train stations vary due (some facilities may be operated by third parties). Some commuter train systems and services though do not operate on weekends and holidays so it's best to check the system's website to plan ahead. Please don't forget to buy tickets <b>before</b> you board the train as some systems will have a substantial mark-up on the tickets sold on-board while others won't sell tickets on-board and will subject you to a hefty fine instead. </p>\n <p><br>\n Some cities also have <b>subway and light rail</b> systems for local travel within a city. </p>\n <h3> <span>By boat</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>America has the largest system of <b>inland waterways</b> of any country in the world. It is entirely possible to navigate around within the United States by boat. Your choices of watercraft range from self-propelled canoes and kayaks to elaborate houseboats and riverboat cruises. </p>\n <p>Rivers and canals were key to developing the country, and traversing by boat gives you a unique perspective on the nation and some one of a kind scenery. Some examples of waterways open to recreational boating and/or scheduled cruises are: </p>\n <p>Each year, many first time and beginning boaters successfully navigate these waterways. Do remember that any kind of boating requires some preparation and planning. In general, the Coast Guard, Canal and Seaway authorities go out of their way to help recreational boaters. They will also at times give instructions which you are expected to immediately obey. For example, small craft may be asked to give way to larger craft on canals, and weather conditions may require you to stop or change your route. </p>\n <p>Several coastal cities, including <span>San Francisco</span>, <span>Seattle</span> and <span>New York City</span>, operate ferry services between local destinations. Some islands, such as <span>Catalina Island</span> or <span>Nantucket</span> are only accessible by ferry. </p>\n <h3> <span>By car</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>America's love affair with the automobile is legendary and most Americans use a car when moving within their city, and when travelling to nearby cities in their state or region. However, many Americans can and do travel between the vast regions of their country by auto - often going through different time zones, landscapes, and climates. In the winter months (Dec though March) millions of American nomads travel south to the warm desert and subtropical climates in everything from cars to motor homes (called \"RV's\"). </p>\n <p>Generally speaking, the older American cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, DC, Seattle, and Philadelphia are best to see using public transport or even on foot (at least within their downtown cores). However, the newer sunbelt cities (normally in the West and South) are built for the automobile, so renting or bringing your own car is usually a very good idea. This applies even to very large cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami, where public transport is very limited and having a car is the most practical way of getting around. In the smaller American cities, everything is very spread out and public transport thin. Taxis are often available, but if you're not at the airport, you may have to phone for one and wait a half-hour or so to be picked up, making similar arrangements to return. Taxis are typically a expensive option to use. While most Americans are happy to give driving directions, don't be surprised if many aren't familiar with the local public transport options available. </p>\n <p>Gas stations usually sell regional and national maps. Online maps with directions are available on several websites including MapQuest and Google Maps. Drivers can obtain directions by calling 1-800-Free411, which will provide them via text message. GPS navigation systems can be purchased for around $100, and car rental agencies often rent GPS units for a small additional fee. Many smartphones are now bundled with GPS navigation software that offers turn-by-turn directions. Your mobile phone provider may charge you for data use, since mobile phone GPS navigation is best used with an Internet connection. Several GPS navigation apps can now support \"offline maps\" features where you can download maps in advance, but without Internet access, the navigation app will not have access to real-time traffic data and may direct you to drive right into the middle of a severe traffic jam. Even states that ban the use of hand-held phones by drivers often allow the use of GPS features, as long as the driver enters no data when in motion (check local laws in the places you will be travelling). </p>\n <p>Unlike most of the rest of the world, the United States continues to use a system of measurement based on the old British imperial system for the most part, meaning that road signs are in miles and miles per hour, but fuel is sold in gallons smaller than those used in the UK. If driving a car from Canada or Mexico, make sure you know the conversions from metric to imperial units. In the case of Canadian cars, you should check your owner's manual to see if your speedometer and odometer can be switched from metric to imperial (and back), and if so, how to do so, and make the switch at the border stop. Most cars sold in the US and Canada today can be readily switched between the two sets of units. The vast majority of cars in the United States (and Canada, for that matter) are equipped with automatic transmission - manual (stick shift) cars are very much the exception to the rule and are generally only found on sports cars, so bear that in mind if you do rent a car. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Great American Road Trip</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>A romantic appeal is attached to the idea of <b>long-distance car travel</b>; many Americans will tell you that you can't see the \"real\" America except by car. Given the dearth of public transportation in most American cities, the loss of time travelling <i>between</i> cities by car rather than flying can be made up by the convenience of driving around <i>within</i> cities once you arrive. In addition, many of the country's major <b>natural attractions</b>, such as the <span>Grand Canyon</span>, are in rugged landscapes and environments, and are almost impossible to get to without an automobile. If you have the time, a classic American road trip with a rented car (see below) is very easy to achieve and quite an adventure. Just keep in mind that because of the distances, this kind of travel can mean many hours, days, or even a week behind the wheel, so pay attention to the comfort of the car you use. Some roads go though hazardous environments (hot deserts, dense forests and jungles, harsh steppes and savannas, marshy/wet areas, geothermal areas, rugged mountains,) and through areas with dangerous wildlife (Bobcats, Pumas, Jaguars, constrictors, Pronghorn, poisonous snakes, alligators, Coyotes, bears...etc) and weather (the U.S. can be struck by any manner of disasters, from tornadoes, dust storms, and hurricanes, to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis,) so be aware of the environment you are travelling through. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Interstate System</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p><i>See also:</i><span>Interstate Highway System</span></p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/KjmwEYj1y6g3sjI3yYUBacRtTmpSid0I30g2l0UsHxH0g56v3GA=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/XitxJsBDTUS1E2xdtT1fsCbJjrCDDdfPD4uwNqKw7NbKF-IorLo=/upload/shared//b/b3/Daltonsign.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>There's always a road going your way. The United States exclusively uses miles rather than kilometers!</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The United States is covered with the largest and most modern highway system in the world. Interstates are always freeways—that is, controlled access divided highways with no at-grade crossings, the equivalent of what Europeans call a \"motorway\". These roads connect all of the major population centers, and they make it easy to cover long distances—or get to the other side of a large city—quickly. These highways cross the entire US mainland from the Atlantic to the Pacific, through several time zones, landscapes, and climates. </p>\n <p>Most of these highways have modern and safe state run \"Rest Areas\" or \"Service Plaza\" areas. These rest stops normally offer restrooms, vending machines, and phone service. Service Plazas (more likely found on toll roads) may offer fuel, restaurant(s), and simple vehicle repair. Many of these rest stops also offer tourist information and picnic areas. Additional commercial traveler services tend to congregate on the local roads just off popular interstate highway exits. Sometimes you'll find a <b>truck stop</b>, an establishment that caters to long-haul truckers but is open to all travelers. Signs on the highway will indicate the services available at upcoming exits, including gas, food, lodging, and camping, so you can choose a stopping point as you're driving. </p>\n <p>Note that in some eastern states, Interstates are called expressways or just highways. Western states as well as US federal law defines expressways as limited access divided highways with reduced at-grade crossings (meaning that you can and will see occasional cross-traffic on western expressways), while freeways are defined as divided highways with full access control and no at-grade crossings. Many eastern states do not follow the same distinction. </p>\n <p>Primary Interstates have one- or two-digit numbers, with odd ones running north-south (e.g. I-5) and even ones running east-west (e.g. I-80). Three-digit interstate numbers designate shorter, secondary routes. An odd first digit signifies a \"spur\" into or away from a city; an even first digit signifies a \"loop\" around a large city. The second two digits remain the same as the primary Interstate that travels nearby (e.g., I-495 is a loop that connects to I-95). </p>\n <p>The vast majority of interstates do not charge tolls. However, the Departments of Transportation of Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania operate long-distance, limited-access toll roads called <b>Turnpikes</b>. Tolls are also frequently levied for crossing notably large bridges or tunnels, and some states are even turning to requiring tolls on Federal Interstate highways to defray their maintenance costs (West Virginia is most notable for this). While the majority of entrances and exits for the Turnpike systems of these states collect tolls in cash, states are increasingly turning to electronic tolling by outfitting vehicles with small RFID transponders, or, more recently, photographic recording and recognition of the vehicle's license plate. If you plan on driving in a state that offers toll roads, it is worthwhile to ask your rental car agency about the electronic tolling options available to you, as paying tolls in cash is becoming incrementally more difficult as electronic options and open-road tolling (paying tolls electronically without having to stop), on Florida's Turnpike in particular, are rapidly becoming more widely accepted. Nearly all rental car agencies that operate in Florida offer some form of prepaid tolling plan. Credit cards and travelers' checks are usually not accepted by state-operated toll plazas, but there are some exceptions (for example, the Ohio Turnpike accepts most major credit cards). </p>\n <p>Speed limits on Interstate Highways can vary from state to state, and also according to geography (for example, slower on mountain passes and within cities than on long straight rural sections). Posted speed limits can range from as low as 45 miles per hour (70km/h) in densely urban areas to as much as 85mph (135km/h) in certain rural stretches of Texas, but mostly they'll be between 65 and 70mph (105–113km/h) on the east coast and 65 to 75mph (105-120km/h) out west. The speed limits (in miles per hour) are always clearly and frequently posted on Interstates. </p>\n <p>American drivers often drive a bit over the posted speed limit, especially on Interstates (5 to 10mph (8–15km/h)). Driving more than 10mph over the posted speed limit greatly increases the chance of receiving a speeding ticket; 15mph or more over the limit when observed by law enforcement will usually earn you a ticket or, depending on the state, result in a license suspension. Driving too slow can actually be dangerous. A good rule of thumb is to avoid driving much faster than all other cars. Highway Patrol officers are usually most concerned with the fastest drivers, so ensuring you are slower than the fastest speeders is one way to avoid their attention. If you are pulled over, be respectful, address the officer as \"Officer,\" and express heartfelt regret at your excessive speed. You may or may not get a ticket, but remain in your car while the officer process your information. The officer will approach the car and you should roll down your window to speak. The officer will ask to see your drivers license and car registration. Such traffic stops are often routine and low key. </p>\n <p>Many Interstate Highways, particularly around and through very large cities, will segregate the far left-hand lane or lanes and reserve them for high-occupancy use. These lanes are clearly signed, marked with white diamonds down the center of the lane, have double-white lines on the right, and are limited to vehicles with two or more occupants. High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes, called <i>HOV lanes</i> or <i>carpool lanes</i>, are designed to ease congestion on Interstate freeways around large population centers during the very start and very end of the business day, also known colloquially as <i>Rush Hour.</i> At least 22 U.S. cities have HOV lanes, of which about half enforce them only during rush hour and half enforce them 24 hours. If you do not see specific hours posted for HOV lanes, assume the HOV lane restrictions are in effect at all times. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Off the Interstates</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>A secondary system of federal highways is the <b>US Highway system</b>. US Highways may be divided with multiple lanes in each direction on some sections, but they are often not dual carriageways, sometimes with just one lane in each direction. US Highways, which generally pre-date the Interstate system, tend to be older routes that lead through town centers as local streets (with a local name or number) at slower speeds. In many cases, Interstates were constructed roughly parallel to US Highways to expedite traffic that wishes to bypass the cities and towns. If you don't mind stopping at traffic lights and dealing with pedestrians, US Highways can lead you to some interesting off-the-beaten-path sights. </p>\n <p>Each state is responsible for maintenance of the Interstates and US Highways (despite the names), but each one also maintains its own system of <b>State Highways</b> (or <b>State Routes</b>) that form the bulk of the inter-community road network. State Highways are usually undivided but may occasionally be freeways; you can generally count on them being well maintained (and plowed in the winter) and that following one will get you to some form of civilization sooner rather than later. </p>\n <p>In most states west of the Mississippi River, the term \"freeway\" means a divided highway with <i>full</i> access control with maximum speed limits up to 75-80mph (120-128km/h) in Utah and western Texas, while the term \"expressway\" means a divided highway with <i>partial</i> access control. Expressways in western states <i>can and do</i> have occasional at-grade intersections with cross-traffic (that is, travelling perpendicular to mainline traffic approaching at speeds with speed limits set between 40-65mph (64-104km/h)). Only freeways in those states are guaranteed to have no cross-traffic at grade. In most states east of the Mississippi River, the term expressway always means full access control and the term freeway is either a synonym or is not used. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Driving laws</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>As with the rest of North America, Americans drive on the right in left-hand drive vehicles and pass on the left. The sole exception is the <span>U.S. Virgin Islands</span>, which continues to drive on the left-hand side, with mostly left-hand vehicles. White lines separate traffic moving in the same direction and yellow lines separate opposing traffic. </p>\n <p>Right turn on red after coming to a complete stop is legal (unless a sign prohibits it) in the majority of US states and cities. The most notable exception is New York City, where right turn on red is illegal unless a sign expressly allows it. </p>\n <p>Red lights and stop signs are always strictly enforced at <i>all</i> hours in virtually all US jurisdictions, along with traffic lights and lane lines. There is zero tolerance for many traffic manoeuvres often seen elsewhere in many countries around the world. Jumping the green, running a red, driving the wrong way on one-way streets, straddling lanes (especially in a car or truck), or swerving across the double yellow line into opposing traffic on major urban roadways to pass slower (but still moving) traffic will all result in an expensive ticket. </p>\n <p>Most American drivers tend to drive calmly and safely in the sprawling residential suburban neighborhoods where the majority of Americans live. However, freeways around the central areas of big cities often become crowded with a significant proportion of \"hurried\" drivers — who will exceed speed limits, make unsafe lane changes, or follow other cars at unsafe close distances (known as \"tailgating\"). Enforcement of posted speed limits is somewhat unpredictable and varies widely from state to state. Not exceeding the pace of other drivers will usually avoid a troublesome citation. Beware of small towns along otherwise high-speed rural roads (and medium-speed suburban roads); the reduced speed limits often posted for traffic going through such towns are strictly enforced. </p>\n <p>Another issue in many locations is drivers who linger in left lanes of multi-lane divided highways — that is, who refuse to move to the right for traffic attempting to pass. While this is seen as extremely discourteous and often dangerous, it is not illegal in most US jurisdictions unless the driver is travelling well below the speed limit. (This differs, for example, from Germany, where failing to move right to make way for passing drivers <i>and</i> passing on the right are <i>very</i> serious violations and strictly enforced.) One state that has attempted to address this issue is Georgia, which passed a law in March 2014 making it a violation to fail to move to the right for a passing vehicle, even if the driver being passed is exceeding the posted speed limit. </p>\n <p>Driving law is primarily a matter of state law and is enforced by state and local police. Fortunately, widespread adoption of provisions of the Uniform Vehicle Code, and federal regulation of traffic signs under the Highway Safety Act, means that most driving laws do not vary much from one state to the next. All states publish an official driver's handbook which summarizes state driving laws in plain English. These handbooks are usually available both on the Web and at many government offices. </p>\n <p>AAA publishes a AAA/CAA Digest of Motor Laws, which is now <a target=_blank href=http://drivinglaws.aaa.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">available online for free</a>. The Digest contains comprehensive summaries in plain English of all major driving laws that typically vary between states. The Digest's coverage includes all US states and all Canadian provinces. </p>\n <p>International visitors aged 18 and older can usually drive on their foreign driver's license for up to a year, depending on state law. Licenses that are not in English must be accompanied by an International Driving Permit (IDP) or a certified translation. Persons who will be in the United States for more than a year must obtain a driver's license from the state they are residing in. Written and practical driving tests are required, but they are usually waived for holders of valid Canadian, Mexican, and some European licenses. </p>\n <p>Traffic signs often depend on the ability to read English words. Drivers who can read English will find most signs self-explanatory. (Progress toward adopting signs with internationally understood symbols is extremely slow; don't count on seeing any.) Distances and speeds will almost always be given in miles and miles per hour (mph), without these units specified. Some areas near the Canadian and Mexican borders may feature road signs with distances in both miles and kilometers. </p>\n <p>Police patrol cars vary in make, model, color, and livery from state to state and even town to town, but all are equipped with red and/or blue flashing lights and a siren. Many police vehicles in the United States are American brand (Ford, Chevrolet, etc). If you see the lights or hear the siren, pull to the right-hand shoulder of the road to let them by. If the patrol car is directly behind you, it's your car the officer is targeting; in that case, pull over as soon as it is practical for you to do so safely, even if this means driving some extra distance. It is extremely important that you pull off the road as soon as you are able. Use your turn signals or your hazard lights to show the officer you are complying. The officer will request to see your drivers license, the registration for the vehicle, and your proof of insurance coverage, and/or rental car documentation. Many traffic stops are recorded by a video camera in the officer's patrol car, as well as a lapel microphone on their person. See the section on <span>police officers</span> in the Stay Safe section below. </p>\n <p>There's a chance of coming across a police interior border checkpoint when driving on the highway. The permanent ones are in the states bordering <span>Mexico</span>. But there's a random chance of encountering temporary ones in any state. The purpose is to help prevent illegal immigration. As with crossing into the U.S. from neighboring countries, police will require you to show proof of identification and will check your vehicle for any possible illegal immigrant(s) or other illegals federal or state wise. </p>\n <h4> <span>Car rental</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>Generally, you must be 25 or older to rent a car without restrictions or special charges. Rental car agencies in some states may be able to rent a vehicle to drivers as young as 21, but may impose a hefty surcharge. The states of New York and Michigan have laws forcing rental car agencies to rent to drivers as young as 18. </p>\n <p>Virtually every car from every rental agency in the U.S. runs on unleaded gasoline and has an automatic transmission. Renting a car usually costs anywhere from $20 and $100 per day for a basic sedan, depending on the type of car and location, with some discounts for week-long rentals. </p>\n <p>European car rental giant <a target=_blank href=http://www.sixt.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Sixt</a> ☎ +1 888 749-8227 has been expanding into the US in recent years, and is found in a handful of states, but is absent from important states like Hawaii and Illinois. For several years, European car rental company Europcar was allied with National, but in 2013 switched its US alliance partner to Advantage Rent A Car. </p>\n <p>There are no large national discount car rental agencies, but in each city there is usually at least one. Some discount car rental companies which operate only in particular regions are Advantage Rent A Car <a target=_blank href=http://www.advantage.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">[6]</a> (now owned by Hertz and expanding across the country), E-Z Rent-A-Car <a target=_blank href=http://www.e-zrentacar.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">[7]</a> (+1 800 277 5171) and Fox Rent A Car <a target=_blank href=http://www.foxrentacar.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">[8]</a>. The Internet or the <i>Yellow Pages</i> are the easiest ways to find them. Another well-known discount chain is Rent-A-Wreck <a target=_blank href=http://www.rentawreck.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">[9]</a> (+1 800 944 7501). It rents used cars at significantly lower prices. </p>\n <p>Most rental car agencies have downtown offices in major cities as well as offices at major airports. Not all companies allow picking up a car in one city and dropping it off in another (the ones that do almost always charge extra for the privilege); check with the rental agency when making your reservations. </p>\n <p>One factor that will strongly influence the price of your car rental will be location. Sometimes renting a car at an airport or near-airport location will cost three or four times as much as renting the same car from the same company at a location far from the airport (but your cost calculations must incorporate the additional time and money it will take to reach the distant off-airport location). In other areas, the airport location may be cheaper. Online travel websites such as Orbitz or Expedia can be useful for comparing prices and making reservations. </p>\n <p>Rental agencies accept a valid driver's license from your country, which must be presented with an International Drivers Permit if your license needs to be translated. You may wish to join some kind of <b>auto club</b> before starting a large American road trip, and having a cell phone is a very good idea. Most rental agencies have some kind of emergency road service program, but they can have spotty coverage for remote regions. The largest club in the United States is the American Automobile Association <a target=_blank href=http://www.aaa.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">[10]</a> (+1-800-391-4AAA), known as \"Triple A\". A yearly membership runs about $60. AAA members also get discounts at many hotels, motels, restaurants and attractions; which may make it worth getting a membership even if you don't drive. Note that some non-U.S. automobile clubs have affiliate relationships with AAA, allowing members of the non-U.S. club to take full advantage of AAA road service and discount programs. Among these clubs are the Canadian Automobile Association, The Automobile Association in the UK, and ADAC in Germany. </p>\n <p>Alternatively, Better World Club <a target=_blank href=http://www.betterworldclub.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">[11]</a> (+1-866-238-1137) offers similar rates and benefits as AAA, but with often more timely service. It is a more eco-friendly choice as 1% of revenue is donated to environmental cleanup programs. . </p>\n <p>The prices shown on rental car Web sites vary dramatically based upon whether the renter is a US resident or not. There are several reasons for this. </p>\n <p>On the one hand, US residents are charged less because the rental car companies know that most Americans are covered for loss or damage to the rental car either by their credit card or the insurance policy on their primary personal vehicle at home, and most American personal auto policies extend coverage to rental cars. Without appropriate loss damage waiver cover, you could be personally liable for the entire cost of the car should it be written off in an accident, and without appropriate liability insurance, you could face serious criminal or civil liability if you are later held to be at fault by a court of law for an accident which caused serious personal injury or death. Purchasing loss damage waiver cover, and both required and supplemental liability insurance may add up to $30/day to the price of a rental, in some cases doubling the price of the rental. </p>\n <p>On the other hand, the rental car industry is well aware that many visitors are from countries which aren't as wealthy as the US, and that some countries also have strict driver licensing and testing schemes that sharply reduce the likelihood of licensed drivers getting into accidents abroad. Thus, they try to optimize pricing separately for such visitors. If you identify your country of origin or book through Web sites customized to your own local market, you may be given a quote which includes loss damage waiver and both required and supplemental liability insurance for considerably less. Many <span>travel insurance</span> policies include cover for some rental car damage - check your policy against the rental terms and conditions. </p>\n <h4> <span>Fuel</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>Gasoline (\"gas\") is sold by the gallon, at stations that are primarily self-service (you must pump your own gas) with the exception of those in New Jersey and parts of Oregon (where self-service is illegal). The American gallon is smaller than the UK gallon, and equals 3.785 liters. The US octane scale is different from that used in Europe; a regular gallon of U.S. gasoline is rated at 87 octane, the equivalent of about 92 in Europe. In most states, gas stations offer a choice of three levels of octane: 87 (regular), 89 (midgrade or plus), and 91 (premium). Unless you are renting a luxury vehicle, your vehicle will likely require only 87 regular. </p>\n <p>One octane-related detail to watch for—at higher elevations in the mountain west, regular unleaded is often rated at 85 or 86 octane. This practice began when car engines had carburetors, and lower octane helped those cars run smoothly at altitude. Using 85 or 86 octane in a modern, fuel-injected vehicle rated for 87 octane or higher for prolonged periods may cause engine damage. </p>\n <p>Visitors from countries where self-service is illegal may feel intimidated by the idea of pumping their own gas, but should not be. US self-service gas pumps have clear directions printed on them and are easy to use. The pump will automatically stop when it senses gas backing up into the nozzle (thus indicating the tank is full). When you finish, replace the nozzle in its slot on the pump, reinsert and turn the gas cap until it begins to make clicking noises, and then close the gas cap access door. </p>\n <p>Nevertheless, most self-service gas stations will have staff on-hand to pump gas for you if you need assistance. Simply honk your horn quickly a couple of times, or ask for assistance inside the office or adjoining convenience store. </p>\n <p>Diesel is not as common, due to heavier federal taxes on it.

Prices fluctuate by region and season. As of December 2014, current prices are averaging near $2.27/gallon (equivalent to $0.59/L) for regular and $3.16/gallon for diesel ($0.83/L). Fuel prices in the United States tend to change every season. </p>\n <p>Gas prices vary dramatically from state, territory, and federal district based on a number of variables, primarily state sales tax rates (which are invariably included in the advertised price) and anti-pollution requirements. The highest prices are usually found in Hawaii, Alaska, the West Coast, Illinois, and New York. The lowest prices are generally found in the south central US and also South Carolina. Prices can also vary by city, town, village, and rural area. </p>\n <p>The only truly nationwide gas station chains are Shell and Mobil. Other large chains have achieved almost nationwide coverage but are notably absent from at least one region, like Chevron, Texaco, Exxon, Valero, and Conoco. </p>\n <p>Many gas stations have adjoining \"mini-marts\" or convenience stores where snacks, soda, coffee, and cigarettes are sold, and may or may not offer public bathroom access. In some states, you can also purchase beer. Larger chain stations may also be attached to an \"express\" version of a fast food chain (McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, Subway, etc). </p>\n <h3> <span>By bus</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Long distance</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>Intercity bus travel in the United States is widespread and, while not available everywhere, there are at least three daily routes in every state. Service between nearby major cities is extremely frequent (e.g. as of July 2012 there are 82 daily buses, by seven operators, on an off-peak weekday each way between Boston and New York, an average of nearly one every 10 minutes during daytime hours). Many patrons use bus travel when other modes aren't readily available, as buses often connect many smaller towns with regional cities. The disadvantaged and elderly may use these bus lines, as automobile travel proves arduous or not affordable for some.

Greyhound buses typically runs in 5-7 hour segments, at which time all passengers must get off the bus so it can be serviced, even if it's the middle of the night. Continuing passengers are boarded before those just getting on. There are no reservations on Greyhound buses.

Other people dislike the hassles and maintenance issues that come with RVing. And don't even think about driving an RV into a huge metropolis such as New York.

In some parts of the country, you can also rent other types of motorcycles, such as sportbikes, touring bikes, and dual-sport bikes. For those inexperienced with motorcycles, Harley and other dealerships offer classes for beginners. Wearing a helmet, although not required in all states, is always a good idea. The practice of riding between lanes of slower cars, also known as \"lane-sharing\" or \"lane-splitting,\" is illegal, except in California where it is tolerated and widespread. Solo motorcyclists can legally use \"high-occupancy vehicle\" or \"carpool\" lanes during their hours of operation. </p>\n <p>American enthusiasm towards motorcycles has led to a motorcycling subculture. <b>Motorcycle clubs</b> are exclusive clubs for members dedicated to riding a particular brand of motorcycle within a highly structured club hierarchy. <b>Riding clubs</b> may or may not be organized around a specific brand of bikes and offer open membership to anyone interested in riding. Motorcycle rallies, such as the famous one in <span>Sturgis</span>, South Dakota, are huge gatherings of motorcyclists from around the country. Many motorcyclists are not affiliated with any club and opt to ride independently or with friends. In general, motorcycling is seen as a hobby, as opposed to a practical means of transportation; this means, for example, that most American motorcyclists prefer not to ride in inclement weather. However you choose to ride, and whatever brand of bike you prefer, motorcycling can be a thrilling way to see the country. </p>\n <h3> <span>By thumb</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/MGUi79AymJKKwMiIE0u_mF2ZOzjg6w2EgCJXWX3vPEA9h99pkzY=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/QQz5RJ7zgkag6s7rD5ku6Wg5ASZ4h3QSiNTThRo9GF0_1_iTwlk=/upload/shared//thumb/1/13/Gateway_Arch_St_Louis_Missouri.jpg/390px-Gateway_Arch_St_Louis_Missouri.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Gateway Arch, <span>St. Louis</span>, <span>Missouri</span> in the <span>Midwest</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>A long history of <span>hitchhiking</span> comes out of the U.S., with record of automobile hitchhikers as early as 1911. Today, hitchhiking is nowhere near as common, but there are some nevertheless who still attempt short or cross-country trips. The laws related to hitchhiking in the U.S. are most covered by the <i>Uniform Vehicle Code</i> (UVC), adopted with changes in wording by individual states. In general, it is legal to hitchhike throughout the majority of the country, if not standing within the boundaries of a highway (usually marked by a solid white line at the shoulder of the road) and if not on an Interstate highway prohibiting pedestrians. </p>\n <p>In many states Interstate highways do not allow foot traffic, so hitchhikers must use the entrance ramps. In a few states it is allowed or tolerated (unless on a toll road). Oklahoma, Texas and Oregon are a few states that do allow pedestrians on the highway shoulder, although not in <i>some</i> metropolitan areas. Oklahoma allows foot traffic on <i>all</i> free interstates, but <i>not</i> toll roads and Texas only bans it on toll roads — and on free Interstates within the city of El Paso. Oregon only bans it in the Portland metro area. Missouri only bans it within <span>Kansas City</span> and <span>St. Louis</span> city limits. </p>\n <p>Hitchhiking has become much less popular due to increasing wariness of the possible dangers (fueled in part by sensational stories in the news media). International travelers to the U.S. should avoid this practice unless they have either a particularly strong sense of social adventure or extremely little money. Even many Americans themselves would only feel comfortable \"thumbing a ride\" if they had a good knowledge of the locale. </p>\n <h3> <span>5-1-1</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Some states offer traffic and public transport information by dialing 511 on your phone. </p>\n <h2> <span>Talk</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=1 border=0><tbody><tr no-attr=empty><td align=left width=100%> <p><b>\"Two countries divided by a common language\"</b><br>\n</p>\n <p>Users of British and Commonwealth English will find quite a few terms which differ in US English: </p>\n <p>Please see our <i><span>English language varieties</span></i> article for more words that differ. </p>\n </td></tr></tbody></table> <p><br>\n Most Americans speak <b>English</b>. In many areas, (parts of the South, New England, inner cities, and in the upper Midwest), you'll find some distinctive regional accents and dialects. Nowhere should this pose any problem to a visitor, as Americans <b>often admire foreign accents</b> and most will approximate the standard accent to help you understand them, or try to speak your language if they can. Only 18.5% of American students study a foreign language in primary or secondary school. </p>\n <p>Thus, visitors are generally <b>expected to speak and understand English</b>. The US does <i>not</i> have an official language at the federal (national) level (most states have English as their official language). A growing number of popular tourist sites have signs in other languages, but only English is certain to be available at any given location. There is a wide variety of accents across the U.S., where certain words are spoken or pronounced differently. </p>\n <p>Due primarily to immigration from Latin America, the United States has the third-largest <b>Spanish</b> speaking population in the world. Spanish is a second language in some of the United States, especially California, the Southwest, Texas, Florida, and, to a lesser extent, in the metropolitan areas of the Midwest and East Coast. Many of these areas have Spanish-language radio and television stations, with local, national and Mexican programs. </p>\n <p>Spanish is the first language of Puerto Rico and about 13% of residents on the mainland, most of whom live in the West or South. Spanish speakers in the United States are primarily Puerto Ricans, or first- and second-generation immigrants from Latin America. As a result, the Spanish spoken is almost invariably a Latin American or Puerto Rican dialect. In some areas, a good handle on Spanish can make communication easier. Because many immigrants take service-industry jobs for substandard pay, employees at restaurants, hotels, gas stations, and other such establishments in the West and South are more likely to understand, speak, and translate Spanish. About 13% of primary and secondary students in the United States study Spanish, and may be able to understand basic phrases. </p>\n <p><br>\n</p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/Rh2IEcWlrQ2kZhQg2D_mb7zd3WR_nxxC3QpZ3aomTW5TFGgBov8=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/agbfp3tFYxwnvZxCZY0K4djCl4LO09Oph4BuMGR0zVEgHzG-Sn9UnK0TAEA=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Spanish_in_the_United_States_by_county.gif/300px-Spanish_in_the_United_States_by_county.gif\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Map of Spanish speaking population of USA by county.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><br>\n<b>French</b> is the primary second language in rural areas near the border with <span>Quebec</span>, in some areas of Louisiana, and among West African immigrants, but is not widespread elsewhere. In southern Florida, Haitian immigrants primarily speak <span>Haitian Creole</span>, a separate language derived from French, as their second language, although a substantial number also speak French. </p>\n <p>Thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), some products now have trilingual packaging in English, Spanish, and French for sale throughout the entire trade bloc, especially household cleaning products and small electric appliances. In areas with large numbers of Spanish speakers, the major discount stores like Walmart and Target have internal directional signage in their stores in both Spanish and English. However, the vast majority of consumer products are labeled only in English, and most upscale department stores and boutiques have signage only in English, meaning that a rudimentary grasp of English is essential for shopping. </p>\n <p><span>Hawaiian</span> is the native language of <span>Hawaii</span> but is rarely spoken. <span>Japanese</span> is widely spoken. In the various Chinatowns in major cities, <span>Cantonese</span> and <span>Mandarin</span> are common. Smaller immigrant groups also sometimes form their own pockets of shared language, including Russian, Italian, Greek, Arabic, Tagalog, Korean, Vietnamese, and others. Chicago, for instance, is the city with the second largest ethnic Polish population in the world, behind <span>Warsaw</span>. The Amish, who have lived in Pennsylvania and Ohio for generations, speak a dialect of German. </p>\n <p>Some Native Americans speak their respective native languages, especially on reservations in the West. However, despite efforts to revive them, many Native American languages are endangered, and people who speak them as their first language are few and far between. Navajo speakers in Arizona and New Mexico are an exception to this, but even a clear majority among them speak and understand English too. </p>\n <p><b>Bottom line: unless you're certain you'll be traveling in an area populated with recent immigrants, don't expect to get by in the United States without some English.</b></p>\n <p><b>American Sign Language</b>, or <b>ASL</b> is the dominant sign language in the United States. When events are interpreted, they will be interpreted in ASL. Users of French Sign Language and other related languages may find ASL intelligible, as they share much vocabulary, but users of British Sign Language or Auslan will not. Closed-captioning on television is widespread, but far from ubiquitous. Many theaters offer FM loops or other assistive listening devices, but captioning and interpreters are rarer. </p>\n <p>For the blind, many signs and displays include <b>Braille</b> transcriptions of the printed English.

Note though, that place names that include the word \"falls\" don't always have a waterfall.

And the national parks aren't just for sightseeing, either; each has plenty of outdoors activities as well. </p>\n <p>Still, the National Parks are just the beginning. The National Park Service also operates National Monuments, National Memorials, National Historic Sites, National Seashores, National Heritage Areas... the list goes on (<span>and on</span>). And each state has its own <b>state parks</b> that can be just as good as the federal versions. Most all of these destinations, federal or state, have an admission fee, but it all goes toward maintenance and operations of the parks, and the rewards are well worth it. </p>\n <p>Those aren't your only options, though. Many of America's natural treasures can be seen without passing through admission gates. The world-famous <span>Niagara Falls</span> straddle the border between Canada and the U.S.; the American side lets you get right up next to the onrush and feel the power that has shaped the Niagara gorge. The \"purple majesty\" of the Rocky Mountains can be seen for hundreds of miles in any direction, while the placid coastal areas of the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic have relaxed Americans for generations. The lush, humid forests of the east, the white sand beaches, the limestone mountains of the south, the red extraterrestrial landscapes of the west...it's a country that has something for everyone. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Historical attractions</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Americans often have a misconception of their country as having little history.

Foreign currencies are almost never accepted, although some major hotel chains may accept travelers' checks in other currencies. Canadian currency is sometimes accepted at larger stores within 100 miles of the border, but discounted for the exchange rate. (This is more of an issue nowadays with a weak Canadian dollar.) Watch for stores that really want Canadian shoppers and will accept at par. Often, a few Canadian coins (especially pennies) won't be noticed, and do show up in circulation with American coins as they are the same size (but different metal contents and weight). Now that the Mexican peso has stabilized, it is somewhat accepted in a limited number of locations at border towns (<span>El Paso</span>, <span>San Diego</span>, <span>Laredo</span>, etc), but you're better off exchanging your pesos in Mexico, and using US dollars instead, to ensure the best exchange rate. </p>\n <p>Common American bills are for $1, $5, $10, $20, while the $50 and $100 bills are less common, and the $2 bill is usually only available by special request at a bank. All bills are the same size. All bills are made of a paper blend of cotton and linen; no polymer bills have been released. All $1, $2, and the older $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills are greenish on one side and printed with black and green ink in the other. Newer versions of the $5 (purple), $10 (orange), $20 (green &amp; orange), $50 (pink) and $100 (blue) bills incorporate different gradations of color in the paper and additional colors of ink. As designs are updated every 5-10 years to make it more difficult to counterfeit, you will currently find up to three different designs of some bills in circulation. Almost all vending machines accept $1 bills and a few accept $5 bills; acceptance of larger bills ($50 and $100) by small restaurants and stores is less common because they may not have enough change available. No US banknotes have been demonetized in the last 80 years and older series of bills are valid. In the unlucky event that your dollars get damaged or torn, U.S. banks will replace the notes for free if enough of the security features are still legible. Note that $2 bills are uncommon and often considered a novelty or a collector's item, or sometimes even a fun gift. </p>\n <p>The standard coins are the <b>penny</b> (1¢, copper color), the chunky <b>nickel</b> (5¢, silver color), the tiny <b>dime</b> (10¢, silver color) and the <b>quarter or quarter dollar</b> (25¢, silver color). <i>None of these coins display the numeral of their value</i>, so it is important to recognize the names of each. The size doesn't necessarily correspond to their relative value: the dime is the smallest coin, followed by the penny, nickel, and quarter. However, the four standard coins have had stable designs, at least on their obverses. The same American presidents have graced the front of the penny, nickel, dime, and quarter since 1909, 1938, 1946, and 1932 respectively. They also have had the same respective diameters and thicknesses since before the 20th century, so it is possible and common to receive coins decades old in change. The <b>Half dollar</b> (50¢, silver) and <b>dollar</b> ($1, silver or gold colored) coins exist but are uncommon in general circulation. No American coins have been devalued or demonetized, although changes in design and composition have driven virtually all examples of non-current types from circulation and coin tills. </p>\n <p>Coin-operated machines universally accept nickels, dimes, and quarters. Pennies will not be accepted at unmanned vending machines or parking meters, but will be accepted at self-scan checkout machines at supermarkets. Most machines that accept coins will accept dollar coins, although this may not be stated on the machine since the dollar coin is not often used. Machines that accept coins will not accept half dollars, unless specifically marked that they will. Coin-operated machines may or may not accept similarly sized and valued foreign coins (i.e., Canadian coins) depending on the sensitivity and internal settings of the machine. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Currency exchange and banking</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p><b>Currency exchange</b> centers are rare outside the downtowns of major coastal and border cities, and international airports, however, many banks can also provide currency exchange services. Note that exchange rates are mediocre at airports and downright terrible at currency exchange centers in the suburbs. It is easiest to exchange major currencies like the euro, the UK pound, the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso, and the Canadian dollar. Visitors in possession of other currencies will find less places willing to accept them, or if at all, at less optimal rates. Major foreign exchange services at airports are provided by either <a target=_blank href=http://www.travelex.com/US/Products/Foreign-Currency/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Travelex</a> or <a target=_blank href=https://www.iceplc.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">ICE Plc (International Currency Exchange)</a></p>\n <p>The Big Four U.S. retail banks are Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citibank, all of which have branches and ATMs in most major cities in the Lower 48 states. Because interstate bank branching was legalized only in 1994, many parts of the U.S. (like <span>Hawaii</span>, <span>Alaska</span>, and the territories) are poorly served by the big retail banks and are dominated by local banks. A few international banks have made inroads into the U.S. like HSBC, BBVA, and Rabobank, but because the country is so big, they are still relative newcomers and interstate banking laws are so restrictive, their branch networks are relatively limited. </p>\n <p>Most <b>automated teller machines</b> (ATMs) can handle foreign bank cards or credit cards bearing Visa/Plus or MasterCard/Cirrus logos; note, however, that many ATMs charge fees of about $3 for use with cards issued by other banks (often waived for cards issued outside of the U.S., but banks in one's home country may charge their own fees). Smaller ATMs found in restaurants etc. often charge higher fees (up to $5). Some ATMs (such as those at Sheetz gas stations and government buildings such as courthouses) have no fee. Another option is withdrawing cash (usually up to $40 over the cost of your goods) when making a debit-card purchase at a large discount store such as Walmart or Target, or at many supermarkets. Stores almost never charge a fee for this service, though the bank that issued your card may. </p>\n <p>Unless your debit / credit card is U.S issued, expect to incur foreign transaction fees from your bank. </p>\n <p>Most bank ATMs support at least one language (usually Spanish) in addition to English. ATMs operated by the Big Four banks tend to support many more languages, especially in urban areas. </p>\n <p>If you are from a country or territory with the US dollar as a official currency, you will not need to worry about understanding prices and currency transferring. Also if you are from <span>Bermuda</span>, <span>Panama</span>, or <span>Bahamas</span>, the official currency(ies) of the mentioned countries and territories have fixed exchange rates to the US Dollar. Meaning what price is said in the U.S. will be understood with your country's/territory's official currency. Example; $125 US Dollars will equal $125 Bermudian dollars, but you will still have to exchange currencies. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Credit and debit cards</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Major credit cards Visa and MasterCard were both launched in the U.S., so it makes sense that today, Visa and MasterCard (and their debit card counterparts/affiliates) are widely used and accepted throughout all 50 states and all inhabited territories. Nearly all large retailers will accept credit cards for transactions of all sizes, even as small as one or two dollars. However, some small businesses and independently-owned stores specify a minimum amount of money (usually $2-5, but can legally charge up to $10 minimum) for credit card use, as such transactions cost them around 30 to 50 cents (this practice is also common at bars when opening a tab). Almost all sit-down restaurants, hotels, and shops will accept credit and debit cards; those that do not post a sign saying \"CASH ONLY.\" Other cards such as American Express and Discover are also accepted by most retailers, but not as widely. Many retailers have a window sticker or counter sign showing the logos of the four big U.S. credit cards: Visa, MasterCard, AmEx, and Discover. However, major retailers might accept only cash or debit cards for payment of prepaid/gift cards/transportation passes. It is also possible to find vending machines which accept credit cards. </p>\n <p>Historically, logos for foreign cards like JCB and China UnionPay were very hard to find outside of high-end luxury boutiques, although both JCB and China UnionPay have longstanding alliances with Discover and can be used anywhere that takes Discover cards. In 2012, many U.S. stores, including Walmart, added JCB and China UnionPay logos to attract Asian tourists. </p>\n <p>When making large purchases, it is typical for U.S. retailers to ask to see some form of photo identification. Shops may also ask for photo identification for foreign issued cards. In certain circumstances, credit/debit cards are the only means to perform a transaction. Hence if you do not have one, you can purchase a prepaid card or gift card with Visa/Mastercard or Amex logo for yourself in a good number of stores but you may need to provide identification before the card is activated. </p>\n <p>Transaction authorization is made by signing a paper sales slip or a computer pad, although many retailers will waive the signature requirement for small purchases. The US has not yet implemented the EMV \"chip-and-PIN\" credit card authorization system used overseas, due to the high cost of upgrading point-of-sale systems and an ongoing dispute among retailers, banks, and credit card firms over who should bear that expense. Between August 2011 and June 2012, the four big credit card networks initially announced target dates in spring 2013 for EMV implementation among their US retailers. The vast majority of retailers failed to meet that deadline. The latest targets for EMV implementation are in 2015 for most retailers, and 2017 for gas stations, although it is still unclear whether those deadlines can be met. </p>\n <p>Gas station pumps, selected public transportation vending machines, and some other types of automated vending machines often have credit/debit card readers. Many gas station pumps and some automated vending machines that accept credit cards ask for the ZIP code (i.e., postal code) of the U.S. billing address for the card, which effectively prevents them from accepting foreign cards (they are unable to detect a foreign card and switch to PIN authentication). However, inputting the digits only of a UK Post Code of the UK billing address, or the digits only of the postal code of the Canadian billing address (in both cases, ignore spaces and letters), and adding on as many zeros as necessary to make five digits works often enough to be worth trying and does no harm. Since July 2013, this trick is guaranteed to work for Canadians who use cards with the MasterCard logo at gas stations that require a ZIP code prompt. At gas stations you can use a foreign issued card by paying the station attendant inside. </p>\n <p>In many big tourist cities, watch out for merchants trying to convert your USD purchase to your home currency when using your foreign debit / credit card. This is known as dynamic currency conversion and the exchange rate, at the point of sale, is NEVER in your favor; regardless of what you are told by the merchant. Always opt to be charged in USD. You can also avoid this by buying a prepaid debit card as long as you ensure there is sufficient funds in the card. </p>\n <h3> <span>Gift cards</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Each major commercial establishment (e.g. store, restaurant, online service) with a statewide, regional, nationwide or online presence makes its own gift card available to consumers for use at any of its establishments nationwide or its online store. In spite of the word \"gift\" in gift card, you can actually purchase and use these cards for yourself; however, they are most commonly given to others as gifts. This is a more polite way to give someone money as a gift, and is a standard gift for someone whom you don't know very well. A gift card for a certain establishment can be purchased at any of the establishment's branches. Supermarkets and pharmacies also have a variety of gift cards from different stores, restaurants and other services. Once these are purchased by you or given to you by friends, you can use a particular store or restaurant's gift card at any of its branches nationwide or online store for any amount. In case funds in the gift card are insufficient, you can use other payment methods to pay for the balance (like cash, credit card, a 2nd gift card particular to the establishment). VISA, MasterCard and American Express gift cards work very similarly to their credit/debit card counterparts. The gift card also has instructions on how to check your remaining balance online. Take note that the gift cards are unlikely to be accepted in the establishment's branches outside the U.S. though when you return home you can still use any remaining amount in the gift card in the establishment's online store. Also keep in mind that some gift cards expire, which makes the money on them worthless so always double check if there is one and how long you have to use the gift card. </p>\n <h3> <span>Sales tax</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>There is no nationwide sales tax (such as VAT or GST), the only exception being motor fuels like gasoline and diesel. As a result, state and/or local taxes (see below) on major purchases cannot be refunded by customs agents upon leaving the United States. </p>\n <p>However, most states have a <b>sales tax</b>, ranging from 2.9% to nearly 10% of the retail price; 4-6% is typical. Certain counties and even cities have their own sales taxes, which are added to the total tax. Sales tax is <i><b>almost never included in posted prices</b></i> (except for gasoline/diesel, and in most states, alcoholic beverages consumed on-premises), but instead will be calculated and added to the total when you pay. Most grocery items and a variety of other \"necessities\" are usually exempt, but almost any other retail transaction – including restaurant meals, excepting most items ordered for takeout – will have sales tax added to the total. <b>The price displayed is rarely the final price you pay.</b></p>\n <p>Delaware, New Hampshire and Oregon have no sales tax. Alaska has no statewide sales tax, but allows local governments to collect sales taxes. Montana also has no state-wide sales tax, but a few local governments (mostly in tourism-dominated towns) are allowed to collect sales taxes. Minnesota, Pennsylvania and New Jersey do not collect sales tax on clothes. In Massachusetts, clothing is exempt from any sales tax if the item costs no more than $175 (and sales tax is collected only on the amount over $175); in New York, clothing is exempt from state sales tax statewide and local sales tax in some locations (most notably New York City) if the item costs less than $110. At least two states, Louisiana and Texas, will refund sales tax on purchases made by international travelers taken out of the state. </p>\n <p>Regional price variations, indirect hotel and business taxes, etc, will usually have more impact on a traveler's wallet than the savings of seeking out a low-sales-tax or no-sales-tax destination. Many cities also impose sales taxes, and certain cities have tax zones near airports and business districts that are designed to exploit travelers. Thus, sales taxes can vary up to 2% in a matter of a few miles. </p>\n <p>However, even accounting for the burden of sales taxes, US retail prices still tend to be much lower than in many other countries. With one exception, the US has not implemented any form of value-added tax, where each segment in the supply chain is required to charge tax on the value it adds towards the final product. Rather, US sales taxes are charged <i>only</i> by the retailer at the time of the sale of the final product to the consumer. This is one reason for why Americans find everything to be so expensive when they visit other countries. The sole exception is the state of Hawaii, which charges a general excise tax that is <i>worse</i> than a value-added tax; it is levied on the entire price of products at every segment of the supply chain, rather than just the value added. </p>\n <p>If you are coming to the U.S. from a higher-taxed jurisdiction in search of bargains on luxury goods, note that it is much more difficult to find most of the internationally renowned brands of luxury goods in the no-sales-tax states, as such brands have traditionally positioned their boutique stores in the largest and wealthiest states: California, Texas, New York, Illinois and Florida (all of which have sales taxes). Even if you can find a particular luxury brand in a no-sales-tax state, it will likely be only one of multiple brands carried by a local luxury retailer, meaning their inventory will not be able to match the depth of a boutique dedicated solely to that brand. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Places for shopping</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p><b>Shopping malls</b> and <b>shopping centers</b>. America is the birthplace of the modern enclosed \"shopping mall\" as well as the open-air \"shopping center\". Most large high-end malls are operated by nationwide mall operators like Westfield, Simon, or General Growth Properties. In addition, American suburbs have miles and miles of small <b>strip malls</b>, or long rows of small shops with shared parking lots, usually built along a high-capacity road. Large cities still maintain central shopping districts that can be navigated on public transport, but pedestrian-friendly shopping streets are uncommon and usually small. </p>\n <p><b>Outlet centers</b>. The U.S. pioneered the factory outlet store, and in turn, the outlet center, a shopping mall consisting primarily of such stores. Outlet centers are found along major Interstate highways outside of most American cities. Simon Premium Outlets is the largest chain of outlet centers in the U.S. </p>\n <p><b>Major retailers</b>. American retailers tend to have some of the longest business hours in the world, with chains like Walmart often featuring stores open 24/7 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Department stores and other large retailers are usually open from 10 AM to 9 PM most days, and during the winter holiday season, may stay open as long as 8 AM to 11 PM. The U.S. does not regulate the timing of sales promotions as in other countries. U.S. retailers often announce sales during all major holidays, and also in between for any reason or no reason at all. American retail stores are gigantic compared to retail stores in other countries, and are a shoppers' dream come true. </p>\n <p>Travelers should be aware that bargaining is generally not practiced at established stores, though it is welcome at other sales venues (see below). While asking for a price reduction due to an item defect is generally acceptable, retail sales personnel often do not have the authority to change prices and may see attempting to haggle as rude or or even threatening. If you want to ask for a discount, be polite and accept whatever answer you are given. If you don't, you may be asked to leave. </p>\n <p><b>Garage sales</b>. On weekends, it is not uncommon to find families selling no longer needed household items in their driveway, garage, or yard. If you see a driveway full of stuff on a Saturday, it's likely a garage sale. Check it out; one person's trash may just be your treasure. Bargaining is expected and encouraged. </p>\n <p><b>Flea markets</b>. Flea markets (called \"swap meets\" in Western states) have dozens if not hundreds of vendors selling all kinds of usually inexpensive merchandise. Some flea markets are highly specialized and aimed at collectors of a particular sort; others just sell all types of items. Again, bargaining is expected. </p>\n <p><b>Auctions</b>. Americans did not invent the auction but may well have perfected it. The fast paced, sing-song cadence of a country auctioneer, selling anything from farm animals to estate furniture, is a special experience, even if you have no intention of buying. In big cities, head to the auction chambers of Christie's or Sotheby's, and watch paintings, antiques and works of art sold in a matter of minutes at prices that go into the millions. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Major U.S. retail chains</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Department stores</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>According to Deloitte, the largest fashion goods retailer in both the U.S. and the entire world is Macy's, Inc., which operates just over 720 Macy's midrange department stores in 45 states, Puerto Rico, and Guam, plus 7 Macy's Backstage discount stores, 38 upscale Bloomingdale's stores, 16 Bloomingdale's Outlet stores, and 98 Bluemercury cosmetics stores. In other words, nearly every mall you visit will have a Macy's. </p>\n <p>Unfortunately, not all of them are all worth visiting. Most Macy's stores, especially in smaller cities and middle-class suburbs, tend to heavily feature midrange brands. Most brands featured in those stores are private brands (that is, the brand concept was created by and is exclusive to Macy's itself, and most of them are not associated with a famous fashion designer). Over time, Macy's, like other U.S. department stores, has shifted its product mix in favor of its own private brands over outside designer brands. Obviously, if it owns the brand, it captures more of the profits. Therefore, shopping at most Macy's stores makes sense only if you are actually a fan of Macy's private brands. </p>\n <p>However, in the largest U.S. cities, Macy's operates high-end regional flagship stores which feature many internationally renowned upscale designer brands, and some of those stores have visitor centers catering to international tourists. In general, you should save your time and money for Macy's regional flagship stores or its gigantic original flagship store in New York City. </p>\n <p>Nordstrom is another upscale department store that is also found in most states. Other upscale department stores that operate coast-to-coast include Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Barney's New York, but they are found only in the wealthiest cities. </p>\n <p>Besides Macy's, other midrange nationwide chains include Kohl's, Sears, and JCPenney. The lower end is dominated by Marshalls, TJ Maxx, and Old Navy. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Discount stores, supermarkets, and warehouse clubs</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>General discount stores like Walmart, Target, and Kmart are ubiquitous, as well as Walmart Supercenters and SuperTargets which are similar to hypermarkets overseas. (Kmart's hypermarket equivalents are called Super Kmarts, but they are extremely rare.) Many discount stores have either a small grocery section or a full supermarket; in fact, Walmart is the country's largest seller of groceries, as well as its largest retail chain. </p>\n <p>The two largest supermarket chains are Kroger and Albertsons, but both operate under legacy regional nameplates in many states. For example, in the nation's second largest city, Los Angeles, Kroger operates Ralphs and Food4Less, while Albertsons operates Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions, and neither operates any stores under their own names. And neither chain operates in the nation's largest city, New York City, where the supermarket business is severely fragmented among a huge number of regional chains. The dominant warehouse club chain in the U.S. is Costco, whose biggest competitor is Sam's Club (operated by Walmart). </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Other chains</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>In several areas of the retail sector, ruthless consolidation has resulted in only one surviving nationwide chain, each of which competes with numerous regional chains and local stores. Examples include bookstores (Barnes &amp; Noble), toys (Toys \"R\" Us), housewares (Bed Bath &amp; Beyond), convenience stores (7-Eleven) and electronics (Best Buy). Both of the last two compete against several almost national chains that technically operate \"coast-to-coast\" but are notably absent from certain regions. For example, Circle K does not operate in the Mid-Atlantic states and New York City metro and Fry's Electronics is absent from most of the East Coast except Atlanta. </p>\n <p>Some areas of retail have two nationwide chains. The two big sporting goods chains are Sports Authority and Dick's Sporting Goods. The two big office stationery chains are Office Depot (which has absorbed OfficeMax), and Staples. </p>\n <p>In others, there are still three nationwide chains. The three big pharmacy chains are CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid—although virtually all Walmart, Target, and Kmart stores also have pharmacies, as do many supermarkets. </p>\n <p>Even if a discount store or supermarket is open 24/7, its pharmacy counter will almost never keep that schedule—it will usually have a morning-to-evening schedule and close overnight. This is only an issue if you need to fill a prescription or purchase a decongestant containing pseudoephedrine (in the latter case, pharmacists are required to record sales because it can be used to illegally make the highly addictive drug methamphetamine). </p>\n <p>Unlike most countries, many nonprescription OTC drugs (like analgesics and cold/flu remedies) are stocked on shelves in the publicly accessible section of the pharmacy, and that section normally remains often to the public even when the pharmacy counter is closed. Generally, such items can be paid for at any checkout location. </p>\n <p>U.S. pharmacies traditionally use the mortar-and-pestle as their symbol, <i>not</i> the green cross used by some European pharmacists (which in the U.S. is the symbol of medical marijuana). However, many U.S. pharmacies are now marked simply by the word \"pharmacy\" as part of their logo. U.S. pharmacies are far larger than their counterparts overseas because in the 1950s, they began selling soft drinks, packaged foods, and general merchandise to compete against the small discount stores (\"dime stores\") that were then widespread, and eventually displaced them altogether. Thus, if you don't see any supermarkets close to your hotel, try a pharmacy if you need to stock up on soft drinks and snacks. </p>\n <h3> <span>Costs</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/okrqm-8uYgqolT55Ep9NlNXU8ZzL9y-nxIZwCoYtl6BxdS7M1bw=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/ZtuIjt_zVdk0CMEswZDiMPpTMcTP-shFG97QWyYa8Y3wSJmVsfI=/upload/shared//thumb/b/b3/Bald_Eagles_Homer_Alaska_USA.jpg/390px-Bald_Eagles_Homer_Alaska_USA.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Bald Eagles in <span>Homer</span>, <span>Alaska</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Unless you live in Australia, Canada, Western Europe, or Japan, the United States is generally <b>expensive</b>, but there are ways to limit the damage. Many foreign visitors come to the United States for shopping (especially electronics, designer apparel, and accessories). While retail prices in the United States for luxury goods are lower than in many countries (as a result of low or nonexistent sales tax), and selection and quality are generally much better (due to the superior bargaining power of the gigantic U.S. retail chains), keep in mind that you could be charged taxes/tariffs on goods purchased abroad. That said, it's easy to go through the \"green lane\" at many airports and avoid paying any tax. </p>\n <p>Additionally, electronics may not be compatible with standards when you return, such as DVD region. That problem is easily avoided by using a \"region-free\" DVD/Blu-Ray player or by viewing the movies on a computer, where region codes are easy to evade. Your U.S.-bought item may not be eligible for warranty service in your home country. </p>\n <p>If you have generous friends from the U.S. who will give gift cards to you for some reason, the cards can sometimes help you defray some costs. </p>\n <p>A barebones budget for camping, hostels, and cooking your food could be $30-50/day, and you can double that if you stay at motels and eat at cheap cafes. Add on a rental car and hotel accommodation and you'll be looking at $150/day and up. </p>\n <p>There are regional variations too: large cities like New York and Los Angeles are expensive, while prices are usually lower in the suburbs and countryside. </p>\n <p>Many hotels and motels offer discounts for members of certain organizations which anyone can join, such as AAA (formerly the American Automobile Association, now generally referred to as \"Triple-A\"). If you're a member, or are a member of a club affiliated with AAA (such as the Canadian Automobile Association, The Automobile Association in the UK, or ADAC in Germany), it's worth asking at check-in. In addition, many hotels may offer senior discounts. The criteria for most is 62 (some set at 65) or older. Rates can be the same, greater, or less than AAA. Be prepared to show ID at check-in for age verification. </p>\n <h3> <span>Tipping</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Tipping in America is optional but is widely used and expected. While Americans themselves often debate correct levels and exactly who deserves to be tipped, generally accepted standard rates are: </p>\n <p>It is important to keep in mind that the legal minimum wage for restaurant waitstaff and other tip-earners is lower than minimum wage in many states, with the expectation that tips bring them up to a more \"normal\" wage. Thus, in restaurants (and certain other professions) a tip is not just a way to say \"thank you\" for service, but an essential part of a server's wages. In some states (including all states on the West Coast), it is required that employers to pay tipped employees full state minimum wage before tips and taxes. Often times servers in these states will be making $12-$15 per hour before tips, but it is still expected that you tip them as much as you would in any other state. </p>\n <p>Remember that while it is expected for you to tip normally for adequate service, you are not obliged to tip if your service was truly awful. If you receive exceptionally poor or rude service and the manager does not correct the problem when you bring it to their attention (and do bring the matter to their attention first), a deliberately small tip (one or two coins) will express your displeasure more clearly than leaving no tip at all. If you do decide not to leave a tip, don't be surprised if the restaurant's manager follows you out of the restaurant to ask you about the reasons for your dissatisfaction. Not leaving a tip is exceptionally rare, and something that will definitely be noticed and will definitely be looked down upon. </p>\n <p>If paying your bill by cash, leave a cash tip on the table when you leave (there is no need to hand it over personally or wait until it's collected), or if paying by credit card you can add it directly to the charge slip when you sign it. Look carefully, as the slip will generally inform you whether a 15% gratuity has already been added. </p>\n <p>Tipping is not expected at restaurants where patrons stand at a counter to place their order and receive their food (such as fast-food chains). Some such restaurants may have a \"tip jar\" by the cash register, which may be used wholly at the customer's discretion in appreciation of good service. Some tipping at a cafeteria or buffet is expected since the wait staff often clears the table for you and provides refills of drinks and such. 10% is generally considered appropriate in this case. </p>\n <p>The majority of jobs not mentioned here are not customarily tipped, and would likely refuse them. Retail employees or those in service positions which require high qualifications (such as doctors or dentists) are good examples. <i>Never</i> try to offer any kind of tip to a government employee of any kind, especially police officers; this could be construed as attempted bribery (a felony offense) and might cause serious legal problems. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Comics and cartoons</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The United States is known worldwide for its comics and cartoon culture, especially in superheroes and supervillans such as Superman and Joker. The U.S. is also famous for its Comic Cons (<i>Comic Conventions</i>) as they are known for being huge and for the variety of products other than comics which now make up a minority of many such events. However, there do exist smaller, more localized \"comic book conventions\" that focus exclusively on comic books and their artists/writers. Visitors to the U.S. must be aware that it can be very difficult to find non-English cartoon DVDs and mangas. Although Spanish and French speakers will have less trouble as many DVDs nowadays have French and Spanish languages as optional choices as subtitles. Due to Japanese anime and manga being the second most popular animation products in the U.S.(after American animation and comics), it is possible to find imported anime and manga products in Japanese only. But they are usually found online or in special shops catering only to Japanese products. Due to the possibility of censorship, the localized products may or may not be presented exactly as they are in Japan. In some cases, the only option may be the localized and edited English language version. As with almost everywhere else in the western hemisphere, all DVDs are in formatted in NTSC. </p>\n <h2> <span>Eat</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span><span><span>[</span><span>add listing</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/QTXn1zqq_D4vwgDelAbIGjdANeN-f-zWaQjhtJoLGlXjIudw7U8=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/TrQWNm_HEsgQalp58CEFl5gdjq243ggBkGia7B_U5BtRI4HeWgc=/upload/shared//thumb/d/d3/American_Food_Farmer%27s_Market.jpg/250px-American_Food_Farmer%27s_Market.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Berries from <span>Santa Monica</span>'s farmer's market</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>While foreigners often conjure up images of hamburgers and hotdogs, there is no \"traditional\" American food and what is seen as traditional will vary widely depending on which region you are in. Many types of food found in the United States have foreign influence, but differ significantly from the cuisine of the country that it is marketed as. Therefore, the food that you find at a \"Chinese\" or a \"Mexican\" restaurant will often be very different from traditional Chinese or Mexican cuisine. </p>\n <p>The variety of restaurants throughout the U.S. is remarkable. In a major city such as New York or Chicago, it may be possible to find a restaurant from nearly every country in the world. One thing that a traveler from Europe or Latin America will notice is that many restaurants do not serve alcohol, or may only serve beer and wine. Some restaurants, especially in larger cities, implement a BYOB (Bring Your Own Booze) policy, in other words, you are invited to bring your own alcoholic beverages. Another is the sheer number and variety of fast food and chain restaurants. Most open early in the morning and stay open late at night; many are open 24 hours a day. A third remarkable fact is the size of the portions generally served by US restaurants. Although the trend has moderated in recent years, portions have grown surprisingly large over the past two or three decades. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Types of restaurants</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/EnTMZlbZnsU1DAzlsK7RvpEL57ljwyUkFXtl7sHLpVbk0ju8tHY=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/jJc0s2wyP4h1T-WgQ2jVtESvq49apBKfbDnyxjZVOeaS3lghxpA=/upload/shared//thumb/b/b0/American_Food_In-n-Out.jpg/135px-American_Food_In-n-Out.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>In-n-Out burger</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><b>Fast food</b> restaurants such as McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, and Taco Bell are ubiquitous. But the variety of this type of restaurant in the US is astounding: pizza, Chinese and Mexican food, fish, chicken, barbecued meat, and ice cream only begin to touch on it. Alcoholic beverages are not served in these restaurants; \"soda\" (often called \"pop\" in the Midwest through Western New York and Western Pennsylvania, or generically \"coke\" in the South) or other soft drinks are standard. Don't be surprised when you order a soda, are handed a paper cup and expected to fill it yourself from the machine (refills are often free). Tea and coffee are also beverage options at nearly all American restaurants. You'll find that most Americans prefer to drink their tea iced. </p>\n <p>Americans tend to love their beverages ice cold so you can expect to see some fellow patrons filling their cups two-thirds with ice and then adding what would seem to be a tiny amount of the actual beverage, but this varies from person to person. Conversely, if the drink is filled for you at the counter, it is considered perfectly acceptable to request less ice, or even no ice depending on your preference. </p>\n <p>The quality of the food varies, but in general it will be cheap, reliable, and fairly tasty (in a mass-market sort of way - connoisseurs and \"foodies\" generally avoid these places like the plague), but the menu will be somewhat limited, and aside from a couple token healthy options, generally high in fat, carbs, and salt. The restaurants are usually clean and bright, and the service is limited but friendly. Tipping is not expected but you must clear your own table after your meal. Failure to do so is considered very rude, both by fellow customers and by the restaurant employees who will be assigned that task in your stead. </p>\n <p><b>Take-out</b> food is very common in larger cities, for food that may take a little longer to prepare than a fast-food place can accommodate. Place an order by phone (or, at an increasing number of establishments, on the Web) and then go to the restaurant to pick it up and take it away. Many places will also deliver; in fact, in some cities, it will be easier to have pizza or Chinese food delivered than to find a sit-down restaurant. Pizza delivery is especially ubiquitous in the US; almost any town of 5,000 or more people will have at least one establishment offering delivery. The main national pizza chains are <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.pizzahut.com>Pizza Hut</a>, <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.dominos.com>Domino's</a>, <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.papajohns.com>Papa John's</a>, and <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.littlecaesars.com>Little Caesars</a>. Most Pizza Huts are dine-in restaurants that also offer carry-out and delivery. Domino's and Papa John's are delivery and carry-out only. Most Little Caesars locations are carry-out only, though some now offer delivery as well. Especially in larger cities, local pizza places compete successfully against the big national chains, and many of them offer delivery. Be aware that tipping delivery personnel is considered customary, particularly as many of them deliver using their own vehicles at their own expense. There is no set percentage, but it is in addition to any delivery charge that the establishment may assess. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/GBNTv7A2EaajFta_wlFN6Sr0lXbYCSzvGybnSoESaiRqt3fvxGA=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/5tV2JYPiDgz7-htfrfgqyRb_PeC_34jX6_CN9YEu9kNR7i-o8_s=/upload/shared//thumb/8/81/American_Food_Chipotle_Bowl.jpg/250px-American_Food_Chipotle_Bowl.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Chipotle has become a staple in America's fast casual scene</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><b>Fast-Casual</b> is a fairly recent new genre of restaurants that grew in popularity during the 2000's. They are places that are usually around $5-7 for a meal and involve a little bit of waiting as food is prepared fresh (although much less waiting than sit-down restaurants). They tend to be somewhat healthier than most typical fast food chains and offer distinct menus. Notable fast-casuals include: Chipotle, Moe's Southwest Grill, Noodles and Company, Panera Bread, Five Guys (a hamburger chain), and Freddies Burgers. </p>\n <p>Very large cities in America are like large cities anywhere, and one may select from inexpensive neighborhood eateries to extravagantly expensive <b>full-service</b> restaurants with extensive wine lists and prices to match. In most medium sized cities and suburbs, you will also find a wide variety of restaurants of all classes. In \"up-scale\" restaurants, rules for men to wear jackets and ties, while once <i>de rigueur</i>, are becoming more relaxed, but you should check first if there is any doubt. This usually only happens at the most expensive of restaurants. </p>\n <p>The <b>diner</b> is a typically American, popular kind of restaurant. They are usually individually run, 24-hour establishments found along the major roadways, but also in large cities and suburban areas. They offer a huge variety of large-portion meals that often include soup or salad, bread, beverage and dessert. They are usually very popular among the locals for breakfast, in the morning or after the bars. Diner chains include <a target=_blank href=http://www.dennys.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Denny's</a>, <a target=_blank href=http://www.normsrestaurants.com/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Norm's</a>, and (in the South) <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.wafflehouse.com>Waffle House</a>, but there are many non-chain diners. Local, non-chain diners are particularly common along the east coast in New York, New Jersey, and Eastern Pennsylvania. </p>\n <p>No compendium of American restaurants would be complete without mentioning the <b>truck stop</b>. You will only encounter these places if you are taking an intercity auto or bus trip. They are located on interstate highways and they cater to truckers, usually having a separate area for diesel fuel, areas for parking \"big rigs\", and shower facilities for truckers who sleep in their cabs. These fabled restaurants serve what passes on the road for \"plain home cooking\": hot roast beef sandwiches, meatloaf, fried chicken, and of course the ubiquitous burger and fries -- expect large portion sizes!. In recent years the concept of the chain establishment has been adopted by truck stops as well, and two of the most ubiquitous of these, Flying J Travel Plazas and Petro Stopping Centers, have 24-hour restaurants at most of their installations, including \"all you can eat\" buffets. A general gauge of how good the food is at a given truck-stop is to note how many truckers have stopped there to eat. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/ueN2F5yKu-BrqZw-z939_QIAxXxcHjlNp0qYgwS8Ckuq0TeRc9o=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/bGJhjEkXOeRzEH5KFzQFkaG88vMsLRVBjOFM-Ok9B7MEo1kdlZs=/upload/shared//thumb/1/1f/American_Food_Truck.jpg/250px-American_Food_Truck.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Typical food truck setup</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The most recent newcomer to the American dining scene is the <b>food truck.</b> Food trucks are just what they sound like - trucks, buses or vans that have been converted into mobile restaurants. The quality of the food served ranges to greasy, poor-quality stuff served at construction sites to high-end operations serving gourmet, restaurant quality food (at surprisingly affordable prices) run by renowned chefs. Food trucks are common in large cities (especially on the West Coast), tend to set up shop where large groups of hungry people typically congregate (e.g. office parks and central business districts during lunch hours, and bars/clubs during evening hours. Most trucks are open for business during afternoon and evening hours Monday through Thursday, afternoon, evening and late night hours on Fridays, and late night hours on Saturdays. These trucks frequently use social media such as Twitter to announce to their followers where they'll be setting up on any given day. </p>\n <p>Some bars double as restaurants open late at night but may be off-limits to those under 21 or unable to show photo ID, and this may include the dining area. </p>\n <p>American restaurants serve soft drinks with a liberal supply of ice to keep them cold (and fill the glass). Asking for little or no ice in your drink is perfectly acceptable, and the drink will still probably be fairly cool. If you ask for water, it will usually be chilled and served with ice, unless you request otherwise. Unlike most other countries, if you ask for \"water,\" it will be still unless you specifically ask for \"carbonated\" or \"sparkling\" water. At bars and restaurants, water is served from the tap and is, therefore, almost always free of charge. Like most other beverages, water will be served with ice unless you request otherwise. In many (if not most) restaurants, soft drinks, tea, and coffee will be refilled for you at no extra charge, but you should ask if this is not explicitly stated. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Types of service</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/wQBKLhW9cDhFup1k1Q6AaKBd0NHIsZjp6b9Hqasf1umySG_2uX8=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/UQeHPiYi279i0CfOHa4waNcuRf3qtX_zqYOC1Lp-y1cBMi7Q_5E=/upload/shared//thumb/5/52/American_Food_Pastry_and_Coffee_Shop.jpg/200px-American_Food_Pastry_and_Coffee_Shop.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Breakfast pastry shop</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Many restaurants aren't open for <b>breakfast</b>. Those that do (mostly fast-food and diners), serve eggs, toast, pancakes, cereals, coffee, etc. Most restaurants stop serving breakfast between 10 and 11 AM, but some, especially diners, will serve breakfast all day. As an alternative to a restaurant breakfast, one can grab breakfast food such as doughnuts, muffins, fruits, coffee, and packaged drinks at almost any gas station or convenience store. <b>Coffee shops</b> (of which <b>Starbucks</b> is the most well-known) are popular for breakfast; although they offer pastries and other items, most people frequent them for a morning dose of caffeine. Some chains, like Dunkin' Donuts or Einstein Brothers Bagels, are sometimes liked more for their coffee than their actual food. </p>\n <p><b>Continental Breakfast</b> is a term primarily used by hotels and motels to describe a cold breakfast offering of cereal, breads, muffins, fruit, etc. Milk, fruit juices, hot coffee and tea are the typical beverages. There is usually a toaster for your bread. This is a quick, cheap (usually free) way of getting morning food. </p>\n <p><b>Lunch</b> is usually eaten around the noon hour and can be a good way to get food from a restaurant whose dinners are out of your price range. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/8MRqHZGaA2a1Vb7muSUkNh_uHkOmVewO4Fwo841DCpcVyA9yyGk=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/QJaJm9_-gn3lRxj3tgzBE7BKzaUX1MgJ46QtHYjF7d5PA-TVCMA=/upload/shared//thumb/4/4d/American_Food_Buffet_Brunch.jpg/250px-American_Food_Buffet_Brunch.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Typical brunch plate</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><b>Dinner</b>, the main meal. Depending on culture, region, and personal preference, is usually enjoyed between 5 and 9pm. Many restaurants serve portions well in excess of what can normally be eaten in one sitting, and will be willing to box up your leftover food (typically referred to as a \"to go box\"). Do not feel the need to finish what you have been served. Making reservations in advance is a good idea if the restaurant is popular, \"up-scale\", or you are dining in a large group. </p>\n <p><b>Buffets</b> are generally a cheap way to get a large amount of food. For a single, flat, rate, you can have as many servings of whatever foods are set out. However, since food can be sitting out in the heat for hours, the quality can suffer. Generally, buffets serve American or Chinese-American cuisine. </p>\n <p>Many restaurants serve <b>Sunday brunch</b>, served morning through early afternoon, with both breakfast and lunch items. There is often a buffet.

The most notable is in the <span>South</span>, where traditional local fare includes grits (ground maize porridge), collard greens (a boiled vegetable, often flavored with ham and a dash of vinegar), sweet iced tea, barbecue (not unique to this region, but best and most common here), catfish (served deep-fried with a breadcrumb coating), cornbread, okra, and gumbo (a stew of seafood or sausage, rice, okra, and sometimes tomatoes). </p>\n <p><b>Barbecue</b>, <b>BBQ</b>, or <b>barbeque</b> is a delicious American specialty. At its best, it's beef brisket, ribs, or pork shoulder slowly wood smoked for hours. Ribs are served as as a whole- or half-rack or cut into individual ribs, brisket is usually sliced thin, and the pork shoulder can be shredded (\"pulled pork\") or chopped (\"chopped pork\"). Sauce of varying spiciness may be served on the dish, or provided on the side. Various parts of the U.S. have unique styles of barbecue. Generally, the best barbecue is found in the <span>South</span>, with the most distinct styles coming from <span>Kansas City</span>, <span>Texas</span>, <span>Tennessee</span>, and <span>North Carolina</span>. However, barbecue of some variety is generally available throughout the country. Barbecue restaurants differ from many other restaurants in that the best food is often found at very casual establishments. A typical barbecue restaurant may have plastic dinnerware, picnic tables, and serve sandwiches on cheap white bread. Barbecue found on the menu at a fancy chain or non-specialty restaurant is likely to be less authentic. Ribs and chicken are always eaten with your fingers; pork and brisket are either eaten with a fork or put into a sandwich. <i>Note that the further one gets from the South, the more likely that \"barbecue\" refers to food cooked on a grill with no smoking, such as hamburgers or hot dogs.</i></p>\n <p>With a rich tradition of immigration, America has a wide variety of <b>ethnic foods</b>; everything from Ethiopian cuisine to Laotian food is available in major cities with large immigrant populations. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/YWKzW8AovvjmrouQ5sS4LFOu9l7WrWF13KLNFb0_6B4trRp7bR4=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/G35s7ZLk2UybyhOH3fU1j01UzUJPN7fjEpKO_hvSynUPMxXdjOo=/upload/shared//thumb/0/09/American_Food_Chinese_Cuisine.jpg/250px-American_Food_Chinese_Cuisine.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Chinese dumplings</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><b>Chinese food</b> is widely available and adjusted to American tastes - by default, a \"Chinese\" restaurant will serve a menu only vaguely related to authentic Chinese food, usually meat in sugary sauce with rice and noodles, often in an all-you-can-eat buffet setting. Authentic Chinese food can be found in restaurants in Chinatowns in addition to communities with large Chinese populations. Japanese <b>sushi</b>, <b>Vietnamese</b>, and <b>Thai food</b> have also been adapted for the American market in recent years. <b>Fusion</b> cuisine combines Asian ingredients and techniques with more traditional American presentation. <b>Indian food</b> outlets are available in most major U.S. cities and towns. </p>\n <p><b>Mexican/Hispanic/Tex-Mex food</b> is very popular, but again in a localized version. Combining in various ways beans, rice, cheese, and spiced beef or chicken with round flatbread loaves called <i>tortillas</i>, dishes are usually topped with spicy tomato <i>salsa</i>, sour cream, and an avocado-based dip called <i>guacamole</i>. Small authentic Mexican <i>taquerias</i> can be found easily in the <span>Southwest</span>, and increasingly in cities throughout the country. </p>\n <p><b>Italian food</b> is perhaps the only cuisine that rivals Mexican for widespread popularity. All manners of pasta can be found here, and American-styled pizzas (typically a thick crust topped with tomato sauce and cheese, in addition to other meats and vegetables) are a popular choice for social events and casual dining. Italian restaurants can be found almost everywhere, and even non-specialty restaurants and grocery stores can provide you with basic pasta meals. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/Iiy3c_tcxxJxbUMBGztDRfyj_5z7fyO5PpZEaw4M5Vf1vpdlEwg=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/Vgd76P3EwSny8LVSOH6smsxMn9Di8j5XXdHJ-okspbtpwnmrBck=/upload/shared//thumb/5/57/American_Food_Greek.jpg/250px-American_Food_Greek.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Gyros</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><b>Middle Eastern</b> and <b>Mediterranean</b> foods are also becoming popular in the United States. The <i>gyro</i> is a popular Greek sandwich which is similar to the Turkish Doner is made of sliced processed lamb on a pita bread topped with lettuce, tomatoes and a yogurt-cucumber sauce. <i>Hummus</i> (a ground chickpea dip/spread) and <i>baklava</i> pastries are frequently found in supermarkets, along with an increasingly widespread and high-quality array of \"pita\" products. </p>\n <p><b>Vegetarian food</b> is easy to come by in big urban areas. As vegetarians are becoming more common in the U.S., so are the restaurants that cater to them. Most big cities and college towns will have vegetarian restaurants serving exclusively or primarily vegetarian dishes. In smaller towns you may need to check the menu at several restaurants before finding a vegetarian main course, or else make up a meal out of side dishes. Wait staff can be helpful answering questions about meat content, but be very clear about your personal definition of vegetarian, as dishes with fish, chicken, egg, or even small quantities of beef or pork flavoring may be considered vegetarian. This is especially common with vegetable side dishes in the South. Meat-free breakfast foods such as pancakes or eggs are readily available at diners. </p>\n <p>People on low-fat or low-calorie diets should be fairly well-served in the U.S., as there has been a continuing trend in <b>calorie consciousness</b> since the 1970s. Even fast-food restaurants have \"lite\" specials, and can provide charts of calorie and fat counts on request. </p>\n <p>For the <i>backpacker</i> or those on <i>very restricted budgets</i>, American <b>supermarkets</b> offer an almost infinite variety of <i>pre-packaged</i>/<i>pre-processed</i> foods that are either ready or almost ready for consumption, e.g. breakfast cereal, ramen noodles, canned soups, etc. </p>\n <p>In the largest cities, \"corner stores\" abound. These small convenience stores carry a variety snacks, drinks, and prepackaged foods. Unlike most convenience stores, their products are sold at relatively low prices (especially by urban standards) and can provide for snacks or even (nutritionally partial) meals for a budget no more than $5 a day. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/I2RddrhIGWRrNEg0xRoQh1XMNH7QaRQeeH9a6khX9MjX_PUIedM=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/OTt6TqCKOobbRNqQ_RxejgMCdkcog2PVWtZr3f0BifIytep4YeA=/upload/shared//thumb/a/ac/American_Food_Seafood.jpg/250px-American_Food_Seafood.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Lobster tail</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><b> Seafood</b> is abundant on the coasts, with freshwater and saltwater varieties of fish and shellfish (although finding squid, octopus, and jellyfish will require a bit of effort). The Northeast is famed for its Maine lobsters, and the Southeast has a variety of shrimp and conch. Most of the seafood in Florida is served spicy, as influenced by the Caribbean taste. Seafood dining on the west is equally abundant, and Alaskan salmon is served in high quantity through the Pacific Northwest. The state of <span>Maryland</span> is famous for its Chesapeake Bay blue crabs, which are usually steamed live in a pot with a spicy seasoning. There is a bit of a learning curve to eating Maryland crabs, though any server or local, for that matter, in a crabhouse will gladly give you a lesson. It is not recommended to wear a plastic bib or napkin when eating Maryland crabs or Maine lobster. You will be instantly pegged as a tourist. </p>\n <h3> <span>Etiquette</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>It is usually inappropriate to join a table already occupied by other diners, even if it has unused seats; Americans prefer and expect this degree of privacy when they eat. Exceptions are cafeteria-style eateries with long tables, and at crowded informal eateries and cafes you may have success asking a stranger if you can share the table they're sitting at. Striking up a conversation in this situation may or may not be welcome, however. </p>\n <p>Table manners, while varying greatly, are typically European influenced. Slurping or making other noises while eating are considered rude, as is loud conversation (including phone calls). It is fairly common to wait until everybody at your table has been served before eating. You should lay cloth napkins across your lap; you can do the same with paper napkins, or keep them on the table. Offense isn't taken if you don't finish your meal, and most restaurants will package the remainder to take with you, or provide a box for you to do this yourself (sometimes euphemistically called a \"doggy bag\", implying that the leftovers are for your pet). If you want to do this, ask the server to get the remainder \"to go\"; this term will be almost universally understood, and will not cause any embarrassment. Some restaurants offer an \"all-you-can-eat\" buffet or other service; taking home portions from such a meal is either not allowed, or carries an additional fee. If you are eating with a group, it is very rude to leave before everyone else is ready to go, even if you came separately. Cleaning your plate is a sign that you enjoyed your meal, and doesn't imply that the host didn't serve enough or should bring more. </p>\n <p>Many fast food items (sandwiches, burgers, pizza, tacos, etc) are designed to be eaten by hand (so-called \"finger food\"); a few foods are almost always eaten by hand (french fries, barbecue, chicken on the bone) even at moderately nice restaurants. If unsure, eating finger food with a fork and knife probably won't offend anyone; eating fork-and-knife food by hand might, as it's considered \"uncivilized\" and rude. </p>\n <p>When invited to a meal in a private home it is considered polite for a guest to ask if they can bring anything for the meal, such a dessert, a side dish, or for an outdoor barbecue, something useful like ice or plastic cups or plates. The host will usually refuse except among very close friends, but it is nonetheless considered good manners to bring along a small gift for the host. A bottle of wine, box of candies or fresh cut flowers are most common. Gifts of cash, prepared ready-to-serve foods, or very personal items (e.g. toiletries) are not appropriate. </p>\n <p>An exception is the <b>potluck</b> meal, where each guest (or group/family) must bring a food dish to share with everyone; these shared dishes make up the entire meal. Usually dishes are grouped (e.g., salads, main dishes or casseroles, side dishes, desserts); you should ask the host if they want you to bring something in particular. Ideal dishes for a potluck should be served from a large <i>pot</i>, dish, or bowl, and would be spooned or forked on to diners' plates—hence the emphasis on salads, casseroles, and spoonable side dishes. Make sure to bring enough that if you and your family had to eat only that dish, they would be full, in order to ensure that there is enough food for everyone. </p>\n <h3> <span>Smoking</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Smoking policy is set at the state and local levels, so it varies widely from place to place. A majority of states and a number of cities ban smoking in restaurants and bars by law, and many other restaurants and bars do the same by their own policy. Some states (like New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, and California) have banned <i>any</i> smoking indoors, while some still allow designated smoking areas. Check local information, and ask before lighting up; if a sign says \"No Smoking,\" it means it. Breaking the ban may get you ejected, fined, or even arrested - and lots of dirty looks. Native American reservations are sovereign (independent) land and indoor smoking may be allowed on tribal lands even if you're in a state with an indoor smoking ban. In recent decades, smoking has acquired something of a social stigma (more so than in <span>Europe</span>)—even where smoking is permitted, be sure to ask your dining companions if they mind. With the increasing popularity of eCigarette devices, it is important to note that some establishments ask that you do not use them indoors (and in some locations, such as California, they are banned via the same laws that ban smoking). </p>\n <h2> <span>Drink</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span><span><span>[</span><span>add listing</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <p>Drinking customs in America are as varied as the backgrounds of its many people. In some rural areas, alcohol is mostly served in restaurants rather than dedicated drinking establishments, but in urban settings you will find numerous bars and nightclubs where food is either nonexistent or rudimentary. In very large cities, of course, drinking places run the gamut from tough local \"shot and a beer\" bars to upscale \"martini bars\". </p>\n <p>American tradition splits alcoholic drinks into <i>hard liquor</i> and others. Americans drink a wide array of hard liquors, partially divided by region, but for non-distilled spirits almost exclusively drink <i>beer</i> and <i>wine</i>. Other fermented fruit and grain beverages are known, and sold, but not consumed in great quantities; most fruit drinks are <i>soft</i> (meaning 'non-alcoholic', not 'low alcohol volume'). 'Cider' without further qualifiers is a spiced apple juice, and 'hard cider' is a relatively little-consumed alcoholic beverage in spite of the U.S. having been one of its most enthusiastic consumers a mere two centuries ago. Be prepared to specify that you mean a liquor or cocktail in shops not specifically dedicated to alcohol. </p>\n <p><i>Beer</i> is in many ways the 'default' alcoholic beverage in the U.S., but gone are the days when it was priced cheaply and bought without high expectations for quality. In the last 25 years, America has seen a boom in <i>craft brews</i>, and cities like <span>Baltimore</span>, <span>Philadelphia</span>, <span>San Diego</span>, and <span>Boston</span> are becoming renowned among beer lovers. The various idioms for alcohol consumption frequently and sometimes presumptively refer to beer. While most American <b>beer</b> drinkers prefer light lagers – until the 1990s this was the only kind commonly sold – a wide variety of beers are now available all over the U.S. It is not too unusual to find a bar serving 100 or more different kinds of beer, both bottled and \"draft\" (served fresh in a cup), though most will have perhaps a dozen or three, with a half dozen \"on tap\" (available on \"draft\"). <b>Microbreweries</b> – some of which have grown to be moderately large and/or purchased by one of the major breweries – make every kind of beer in much smaller quantities with traditional methods. Most microbrews are distributed regionally; bartenders will know the local brands. Nowadays all but the most basic taverns usually have one or more local beers on tap, and these are generally more full of character than the big national brands, which have a reputation for being generic. Some <b>brew pubs</b> make their own beer in-house, and generally only serve the house brand. These beers are also typically considered superior to the big national brands. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/FdIPs0apzfIXkNCpAM3Vr_EJJ8wNjSxD-brdIDohhctlXIdsX00=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/V9qu6Rh9Ony5lvT9KEEHbRfiknWuulmW32nTupOEpupQi9MUK_I=/upload/shared//thumb/7/79/Vineyards_at_Palisade%27s_Horse_Mountain.jpg/390px-Vineyards_at_Palisade%27s_Horse_Mountain.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Vineyards in <span>Palisade</span>, <span>Colorado</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><b>Wine</b> in the U.S. is also a contrast between low-quality commercial fare versus extremely high-quality product. Unlike in Europe, American wines are labeled primarily by the grape (merlot, cabernet sauvignon, Riesling, etc.). The simple categories 'red', 'white', and 'rosé' or 'pink' are also used, but disdained as sole qualifiers by oenophiles. All but the cheapest wines are usually also labeled by region, which can be a state (\"California\"), an area of a state (\"Central Coast\"), a county or other small region (\"Willamette Valley\"), or a specific vineyard (\"Dry Creek Vineyard\"). (As a general rule, the narrower the region, the higher quality the wine is likely to be.) </p>\n <p>Cheap cask wines are usually sold in a box supporting a plastic bag; bottled wines are almost universally priced as semi-luxury items, with the exception of 'fortified wines', which are the stereotypical American answer for low-price-per-milliliter-alcohol 'rotgut'. </p>\n <p>All 50 U.S. states now support winemaking, with varying levels of success and respect. <b>California wines</b> are some of the best in the world, and are available on most wine lists in the country. The most prestigious American wine region is California's <b><span>Napa Valley</span></b>, although the state also has a number of other wine-producing areas, which may provide better value for your money because they are less famous. Wines from Oregon's <b><span>Willamette Valley</span></b> and the state of <b><span>Washington</span></b> have been improving greatly in recent years, and can be bargains since they are not yet as well known as California wines. <b><span>Michigan</span></b>, <b><span>Colorado's Wine Country</span></b>, and New York State's <b><span>Finger Lakes</span></b> region have recently been producing German-style whites which have won international competitions. In recent years, the <b><span>Llano Estacado</span></b> region of Texas has become regionally renowned for its wines. The Northern Virginia area, specifically Fauquier, Loudoun, and Prince William counties are also becoming well known for both their flavor, and organized wine tasting tours, supplemented by the scenery seen on the drives between locations. </p>\n <p><b>Sparkling wines</b> are available by the bottle in up-scale restaurants, but are rarely served by the glass as they often are in western Europe. The best California sparkling wines have come out ahead of some famous brand French champagnes in recent expert blind tastings. They are comparatively difficult to find in 'supermarkets' and some non-alcoholic sparkling grape juices are marketed under that name. </p>\n <p>The wines served in most bars in America are unremarkable, but wine bars are becoming more common in urban areas. Only the most expensive restaurants have extensive wine lists, and even in more modest restaurants wine tends to be expensive, even if the wine is mediocre. Many Americans, especially in the more affluent and cosmopolitan areas of the country, consider themselves knowledgeable about wine, and if you come from a wine producing country, your country's wines may be a good topic of conversation. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/IKLIdS13jL6heJxlerQloxuCmk6T2noXRCTZ7lLNDl8fCNwzlbs=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/ybbiTBCUD9dloB5I7Ct37RM1KbQzwWPC5lI327swvUI4DfzQhtE=/upload/shared//thumb/3/3b/Bourbon.jpg/390px-Bourbon.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>America's native spirit — bourbon, straight up</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><b>Hard alcohol</b> is usually drunk with mixers, but also served \"on the rocks\" (with ice) or \"straight up\" (un-mixed, with no ice) on request. Their increasing popularity has caused a long term trend toward drinking light-colored and more \"mixable\" liquors, especially vodka, and away from the more traditional darker liquors such as whiskey and bourbon that many older drinkers favor. However this is not an exclusive trend and many Americans still enjoy whiskey and bourbon. </p>\n <p>It was formerly wholly inappropriate to drink hard liquor before 5PM (the end of the conventional workday), even on weekends. A relic of this custom is <b>\"happy hour\"</b>, a period lasting anywhere from 30 minutes to three hours, usually between 5PM and 8PM, during which a significant discount is offered on selected drinks. Happy hour and closing time are the only presumptive customs in American bars, although 'ladies night', during which women receive a discount or some other financial incentive, is increasingly common. </p>\n <p>Although laws regulating alcohol sales, consumption, and possession vary somewhat by state and county, <b>the drinking age is 21 throughout the U.S.</b> except in <span>Puerto Rico</span> and the <span>U.S. Virgin Islands</span>(where it is 18). Enforcement of this varies, but if you're under 30 you should definitely be prepared to show photo ID when buying alcohol in a store or entering a bar (which often refuse admittance to \"minors\" under 21). In some states, people who are under 21 are not even allowed to be present in bars or liquor stores. A foreign passport or other credible ID will probably be accepted, but many waiters have never seen one, and it may not even be legally valid for buying alcohol in some places. As a driver's license is the most ubiquitous form of ID in the U.S. and have a magnetic strip for verification purposes, some supermarkets have begun requiring them to purchase alcohol. In such cases, it is the cash register not the cashier which prevents such purchases. It's worth noting that most American ID's have the date of birth laid out as month/day/year, while frequently other countries ID's use year/month/day or day/month/year which may cause further confusion. Using false identification to misrepresent your age is a criminal offense in all 50 states, and while most alcohol vendors will simply refuse to sell or take a blatantly fake ID away, a few also call the police which may result in prosecution. </p>\n <p>Most states (currently 45 of them) and Washington D.C. have found and use loupes in the federal law to allow underage drinking, example; in some states like <span>Delaware</span> and <span>Mississippi</span>, underage drinking is legal on private, non-alcohol premises(including private properties not open to the public). As long as he/she is accompanied by the physical presence of a parent or legal guardian who is over the age of 21 and has the approval to consume alcohol, but this varies. In states like <span>Hawaii</span> and <span>Tennessee</span>, Underage consumption of alcohol is allowed for religious purposes. Some states require that the alcohol must be provided by an official religious representative and/or limit the type of alcohol allowed. In states like <span>Texas</span> and <span>Wisconsin</span>, underage consumption of alcohol is allowed on alcohol-selling premises, such as a restaurant or bar, as long as the legal guardian gives the minor the alcohol and is in the presence of the legal guardian. This again varies. In states like <span>Colorado</span> and <span>Nevada</span>, underage consumption of alcohol is allowed for medical purposes. Again this varies. <b>Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, New Hampshire, and West Virginia have no exceptions to underage alcohol consumption laws.</b></p>\n <p>Selling alcohol is typically prohibited after a certain hour, usually 2 AM. In some states, most stores can only sell beer and wine; hard liquor is sold at dedicated liquor stores. In Indiana, sales of any type of alcoholic beverage is banned statewide on Sunday, However, bars are still open and serve alcoholic beverages. Several \"dry counties\" – mostly in southern states – ban some or all types of alcohol in public establishments; private clubs (with nominal membership fees) are often set up to get around this. Sunday sales are restricted in some areas. Some Indian reservations(especially the <span>Navajo Nation</span>) doesn't allow any alcohol on their territory. </p>\n <p>Most towns ban drinking in public (other than in bars and restaurants of course), with varying degrees of enforcement. Even in towns which allow public drinking, a visible bottle (rather than one in a small bag, which is so commonly used for it as to be synonymous with public drinking) is either illegal or justifies police attention. All communities have some sort of ban on \"drunk and disorderly\" behavior, some quite stringent, and as a rule intoxication is an aggravating rather than exculpating factor in all but the most and least severe offenses. <b>Drunk driving</b> comes under fairly harsh scrutiny, with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08% considered \"Under the Influence\" and many states considering 0.05% \"Impaired\" - in <span>Washington D.C.</span> it's illegal to drive with <b>any</b> amount of alcohol in your system. If you're under 21, however, most states define a DUI from 0.00-0.02%. Drunk driving checkpoints are fairly common during major \"party\" events, and although privacy advocates have carved out exceptions, if a police officer asks a driver to submit to a blood-alcohol test or perform a test of sobriety, you generally may not refuse (and in certain states such as <span>New York</span> it is a crime in itself). <b>DUI (\"driving under the influence\"), OUI (\"operating under the influence\") and DWI (\"driving while intoxicated\") are typically punished quite harshly,</b> and as a foreign national it will typically mean the end of your time in the United States - even permanent residents have had their Green Cards revoked and were subsequently deported for DUI. In many jurisdictions catching and enforcing DUIs is the main job of patrolling police; it is watched for zealously and treated severely. It is also usually against the law to have an open container of alcohol anywhere in the car other than in the trunk. Some states have \"open bottle\" laws which can levy huge fines for an open container in a vehicle, sometimes several hundred dollars per container. </p>\n <p>If you're going out to drink with others; always assign at least one person as the designated driver of an automobile. Likewise, you can also arrange a taxi to take you back to your residence. Either way, it is way better than getting a ride in the back of a police car with a DUI on your record. </p>\n <h3> <span>Nightlife</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/hwpUK6Uxl7ZKsqoRr28jrYGVHpzQU9VFO4YhB2_lVJtn-xmxAAI=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/xSosk3gOGS4JQ_mI0BuyiTpk6tpqqVeiEDjE07n8ndOFTxmeKac=/upload/shared//thumb/6/61/LasVegas_Riviera_Neon.JPG/390px-LasVegas_Riviera_Neon.JPG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The bright lights of Sin City, <span>Las Vegas</span>, <span>Nevada</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Nightclubs in America run the usual gamut of various music scenes, from discos with top-40 dance tunes to obscure clubs serving tiny slices of obscure musical genres. Country music dance clubs, or <b>honky tonks</b>, are laid fairly thick in the South and West, especially in rural areas and away from the coasts, but one or two can be found in almost any city. Many nightclubs in America have a large area or \"dance floor\" where people often congregate and dance to the music played by the DJ, although in some areas of the deep south, people also dance to music played by live bands as well. A lot of nightclubs also have multi colored ceiling mounted music lights to brighten up the dance atmosphere. Mostly, a lot of couples and groups go to nightclubs, though singles also go there as well. However, if you go as a single person to a nightclub, remember that, in the United States of America, it is etiquette for the ladies to ask the guys to dance with them. </p>\n <p>Until 1977, the only U.S. state with legalized gambling was <span>Nevada</span>. The state has allowed games of chance since the 1930s, creating such resort cities as <span>Las Vegas</span> and <span>Reno</span> in the process. Dubbed \"Sin City,\" Las Vegas in particular has evolved into an end-destination adult playground, offering many other after-hours activities such as amusement parks, night clubs, strip clubs, shows, bars and four star restaurants. Gambling has since spread outside of Nevada to a plethora of U.S. cities like <span>Atlantic City</span>, <span>New Jersey</span> and Biloxi, Mississippi, as well as to riverboats, offshore cruises and Indian reservations throughout the continental United States. Some states have tolerated card rooms for many years, which have since rebranded themselves as \"casinos\" (notwithstanding their lack of slot machines) to compete for business against true casinos in New Jersey, Nevada, and Indian reservations. </p>\n <p>State lotteries and \"scratch games\" are another, popular form of legalized gambling. However, online gaming and wagering on sports across state lines both remain illegal throughout the U.S. </p>\n <h2> <span>Sleep</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span><span><span>[</span><span>add listing</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/EN7BGWdAJup4ftNMwgzyeh6C9AizOjSxtOZ6GU4J0jIga4C0dQc=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/dYiXCsJTT1kdAL5fXFlQBOErM9E-0kwKWU8wWZ58DW3VYxuLa9M=/upload/shared//thumb/8/84/Seligman_SupaiMotel.JPG/390px-Seligman_SupaiMotel.JPG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Classic 1950s motel in <span>Seligman</span>, <span>Arizona</span>, along <span>Route 66</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Virtually all hotels at check-in will ask for the name of the guest who made the reservation, then demand from that person some kind of photo identification (a passport or driver's license is normally sufficient) and a credit card to cover incidental charges. If you do not have a valid credit card, some hotels will demand a cash deposit instead. Upon check-in, a hotel front desk clerk will almost always issue you a keycard with a magnetic stripe for access to your room, although an increasing number have switched to RFID keycards, which are tapped instead of swiped. </p>\n <p>Business hotels are increasingly available across the country. Generally they are more expensive than motels, but not as expensive as full-scale hotels, with prices around $70 to $170. While the hotels may appear to be the size of a motel, they may offer amenities typically associated with larger hotels. Examples include Marriott International's Courtyard by Marriott and Fairfield Inn; Hilton's Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn; Holiday Inn's Holiday Inn Express; Starwood's Aloft and Four Points by Sheraton, and Hyatt Place. </p>\n <p>Another option are extended-stay hotels directed at business travelers or families on long-term stays (that are often relocating due to corporate decisions). These hotels often feature full kitchens in most rooms, afternoon social events (generally by a pool), and serve continental breakfast. Such \"suite\" hotels are roughly equivalent to the <b>serviced apartments</b> seen in other countries, though the term \"serviced apartments\" is not generally used in American English. Examples include Marriott’s ExecuStay, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites and SpringHill Suites; Extended StayAmerica; Homestead Studio Suites; Homewood Suites by Hilton; and Hyatt House. </p>\n <p><b>Hotels</b> are available in most cities and usually offer more services and amenities than motels. Rooms usually run about $80-$300 per night, but very large, glamorous, and expensive hotels can be found in most major cities, offering luxury suites larger than some houses. Check-out and check-in times almost always fall in the range of 11am-noon and 2pm-4pm respectively. Examples of major hotel chains include Marriott, Renaissance by Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, DoubleTree by Hilton, Sheraton, Radisson, and Wyndham. Examples of upscale hotels include St. Regis, Fairmont, Waldorf Astoria, Crowne Plaza, InterContinental and Ritz Carlton. </p>\n <p>Note that many US cities now have \"edge cities\" in their suburbs which feature high-quality upscale hotels aimed at affluent business travelers. These hotels often feature all the amenities of their downtown/CBD cousins (and more), but at less exorbitant prices. </p>\n <p>In many rural areas, especially on the coasts and in New England, <b>bed and breakfast</b> (B&amp;B) lodging can be found. Usually in converted houses or buildings with less than a dozen units, B&amp;Bs feature a more home-like lodging experience, with complimentary breakfast served (of varying quality and complexity). Bed and breakfasts range from about $50 to $200 per night, with some places being much steeper. They can be a nice break from the impersonal chain hotels and motels. Unlike Europe, most American bed and breakfasts are unmarked; one must make a reservation beforehand and receive directions there. </p>\n <p>The two best-known hotel guides covering the US are the AAA (formerly American Automobile Association; typically pronounced \"Triple-A\") TourBooks, available to members and affiliated auto clubs worldwide at local AAA offices; and the Mobil Travel Guide, available at bookstores. There are several websites booking hotels online; be aware that many of these sites add a small commission to the room rate, so it may be cheaper to book directly through the hotel. On the other hand, some hotels charge more for \"drop-in\" business than reserved rooms or rooms acquired through agents and brokers, so it's worth checking both. </p>\n For more long-term stays there are room rental options posted online such as in Craigslist which can be an afford solution for a cheap bed to crash with a bundled, flat priced rent. <div><table><tbody> <tr no-attr=empty> <td><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/qTTtU5I085JHjtLDNK_zOdjTVmAJo7ONY-Ku-B7PQVK5CnqsgCs=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/KJW9X7l7dlbGiM0ChMwsKsk_8AwJl9iMp0R3CULyiNu0k6mRFrlBAbxVidA=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Ambox_warning_pn.svg/50px-Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></td> <td> <span><b>WARNING:</b></span> Craigslist rentals are not well monitored and have a higher risk of being dangerous or fraudulent. </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody></table></div>\n <p>Some <b>unusual</b> lodging options are available in specific areas or by prior arrangement. For example, you might enjoy staying on a <b>houseboat</b> in <span>Lake Tahoe</span> or the Erie Canal. Or stay in a <b>treehouse</b> in Oregon. More conventional lodging can be found at college or university dormitories, a few of which rent out rooms to travelers during the summertime. Finally, in many tourist areas, as well as big cities, one can rent a furnished house by the day. </p>\n <h2> <span>Learn</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <p>Short courses may be undertaken on a tourist visa. Community colleges typically offer college-credit courses on an open-admissions basis; anyone with a high school degree or its equivalent and the required tuition payment can generally enroll. In large cities, open universities may offer short non-credit courses on all sorts of practical topics, from ballroom dance to buying real estate. They are a good place to learn a new skill and meet people. </p>\n <p>Studying full-time in the United States is an excellent opportunity for young adults seeking an advanced education, a chance to see a foreign country, and a better understanding of the U.S. and its people. It can be done independently by applying directly to a college for admission, or through the \"study abroad\" or \"foreign exchange\" department of a college in your own country, usually for a single term or one year. (Either approach requires, at minimum, an F or J student visa.) The latter is usually easiest; the two institutions will handle much of the arrangements, and you don't have to make a commitment to four years living in a strange country. Be forewarned, however: many state universities and private colleges are located in small towns, hundreds of miles from any big urban centers. They go out of their way to recruit lucrative international students unfamiliar with U.S. geography. Don't expect to spend your weekends in <span>New York</span> or <span>Los Angeles</span> if your college is in <span>North Dakota</span> unless it is part of the academic activities in your school/course. Furthermore, U.S. higher education institutions are distributed along a wide spectrum in terms of prestige, quality, and of course, cost. Outside of an elite group of about 20 to 40 internationally renowned universities, most U.S. colleges and universities aren't that well-known outside of their home state, let alone their home city. </p>\n <p>The common requirements to study at a higher education level will include your admissions essay (also known as the statement of purpose or personal statement), transcript of records, recommendation/reference letters, language tests (TOEFL is most widely accepted but it can be waived if your previous school primarily used English as a medium of instruction), standardized achievement tests (SAT or ACT for undergraduate, GMAT for graduate business schools, GRE for most other graduate programs), degree certificates. As the TOEFL, SAT, GMAT or GRE are administered by the New Jersey-based ETS, you can sit the exam in your home country well beforehand and arrange for your scores to be directly sent to the school you are applying to. You may need to present these documents including your acceptance letter when applying for a student visa. </p>\n <p>The types of schools vary dramatically. (In conversation, Americans tend to use the terms \"school\" and \"college\" inclusively: any college or university might be referred to as \"school\", and a university might be called \"college\".) State university systems are partially subsidized by state governments, and may have many campuses spread around the state, with hundreds of thousands of students. Private colleges are generally smaller (hundreds or a few thousand students), with a larger percentage of their students living on campus; some are affiliated with churches and may be more religious in character. Community colleges are well subsidized, and very inexpensive, but are poorly known, with varying quality. Other kinds of colleges focus on teaching specific job skills, education for working adults, and providing inexpensive college-level education to local residents. Although nearly all colleges are open to students regardless of race, gender, religion, etc. many were originally established for a particular group (e.g. African-Americans, women, members of a particular religion) and may still attract primarily students from that group. Several private colleges remain female-only, there are a few male-only private colleges, and private religious colleges may expect students to practice the school's faith. </p>\n <p>Colleges are funded by \"tuition\" charged to the student, which is often quite expensive, very commonly reaching into the tens of thousands of dollars per year. The most selective colleges (and hence, often the most desirable) run up to $40,000-50,000 per year, including both tuition and \"room &amp; board\" in that price. Most US citizens and eligible non-citizens receive substantial financial assistance from the federal government in the form of grants and low-interest loans, which are not available to most non-residents. Often financial aid for foreign students is provided by their home country. They may be eligible for privately-funded \"scholarships\" intended to provide educational opportunities for various kinds of students. Some U.S. banks offer loans to foreign students, which usually require a citizen to guarantee that they'll be repaid. Contact the Financial Aid Office of any college you are interested in attending for more information about the sources of aid available. </p>\n <p>Almost all US colleges and universities operate web sites (in the .edu domain) with information for prospective students and other visitors. </p>\n <h2> <span>Work</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <p>Work in America is best arranged long before you enter the United States. Young people who are full time students of certain nationalities can apply for a <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1267.html>J1 \"Exchange Visitor\" visa</a> which permits paid work as au pairs or summer work for up to 4 months in virtually any type of job. The United States Department of State has full information on applying for this type of visa including the precise categories that qualify. </p>\n <p>The H-1B visa allows a limited number of skilled and certain unskilled employees to temporarily work in the United States. It usually requires a bachelor's degree and is based on a petition filed by an American employer. The job you wish to apply for should be related to your degree. The most common careers of hard-to-get H-1B visa holders are nurses, math teachers, and computer science professionals. The H1-B cap was filled the day applications started this year, although proposed immigration changes would increase the cap. On the other hand, there is the more permanent employment-based immigrant visa which has similar requirements to the H-1B visa. An employment-based green card is significantly harder to obtain than an H1B, because the employer needs to first go through a tedious labor certification process, and assuming USCIS approves the petition, lengthy backlogs may occur (depending on nationality). </p>\n <p>Paid work is generally not allowed on a B1/B2 visitor visa. Working unlawfully in the United States runs the very real risk of arrest, deportation, and ineligibility to re-enter the country for at least some time. Illegal immigrants also run the risk of working in dangerous conditions without much relief from the law. Note that \"paid work\" includes receiving any sort of compensation or thing of value in exchange for your labor including \"volunteering\" in exchange for lodging. </p>\n <p>If you are seeking to adjust visa status or to enter the U.S. on a working visa you should first check the official <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.state.gov>government websites of the US Department of State</a>, which issues visas abroad, and the <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=https://www.uscis.gov>US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> which administers immigration programs within the United States. Unfortunately, con artists both in the US and overseas often prey on people's desire to travel or work here. Keep in mind that while visa applications do not usually require an attorney or other intermediary, be wary of and verify any \"advice\" offered by third parties, especially non-lawyers. If in doubt about properly applying for such visas, it is best to get a licensed immigration attorney. </p>\n <p>Keep in mind that anyone entering under the Visa Waiver Program <b>cannot</b> adjust their status for any reason. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Minimum Wage</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Federal Minimum Wage is currently at $7.25 an hour. However, most states, the Federal District of Columbia, and all territories have their own set minimum wage. These are almost all higher than this federal minimum and wage floors can also be set even at county or municipal level (city, town or village). For example; minimum wage in the State of <span>California</span> is currently $10.50 an hour, but the City of <span>San Francisco</span> is currently $14.00 an hour, the highest in the U.S., and <span>Seattle</span> is scheduled to eclipse the country by 2022, gradually increasing to $15.00 an hour. While in the Commonwealth of the <span>Northern Mariana Islands</span> (NMI), the lowest in the nation because federal labor laws don't apply to the N.M.I. Minimum wage for tips is $2.13 an hour, again, this varies by state, territory, and municipality. Georgia and Wyoming have a minimum wage for at home workers is $5.15 an hour and some states such as Oklahoma allows a $2 minimum wage for certain workers under small businesses with less than 10 employees and $150,0000 or less in profits. But most are lower than federal minimum wage and others are at the same rate as the minimum wage set by the State, Federal District, or municipality.<b>Note</b>:Minimum wage doesn't often include health insurance coverage. And be aware of the property of which you are working on as it could be a Federal enclave, and a state's minimum wage law will not apply to the Federal enclave. Also note that overtime pay which is extra applies to most workers although it also has many exemptions so do your research. </p>\n <h3> <span>Corruption</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Bribery and other corrupt practices are illegal and most Americans will at best pass on your offer and at worst report it to the police and be offended. </p>\n <h2> <span>Stay Safe</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <p>American movies, television shows, and music videos often give foreigners the impression that the US is filled with extremely high levels of violent crime. While there are some locations in the United States with high crime rates, most violent crime is heavily concentrated in certain <b>inner city</b> neighborhoods (most of which are specifically identified in the relevant city-specific articles in this travel guide), or poor outlying areas. Few visitors to the US experience any sort of crime. If you experience anything unsafe, you may call the emergency number 911. </p>\n <p>Much crime is gang- or drug-related in inner city regions or poor areas located along the US-Mexican border. It mostly occurs in areas that are of little interest to visitors, however, it can and does also occur in high tourist areas of certain cities. You can all but ensure that you won't experience crime by taking common-sense precautions and staying alert to your surroundings. Locations frequented by tourists and visitors (National Mall in Washington DC, and Manhattan in NYC) often have a police presence and are quite safe for all but the most minor petty crimes (eg: pickpocketing). </p>\n <p>Like other regions of the world, many American urban areas have populations of homeless people, some of whom are drug-addicted and/or mentally ill. In certain cities, aggressive panhandling is a concern. If you feel you are being harassed, say NO firmly and walk away and/or call the police. </p>\n <p>Note that security has increased along the US–Mexico border due to increased illegal immigration and drug-related crime. Only cross the country's borders at official ports of entry. </p>\n <h3> <span>Police</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Despite the sometimes negative coverage that law enforcement receives in the U.S. media, you will find that the vast majority of American law enforcement personnel are very professional, and take their responsibility to serve and protect the public very seriously. There is no reason to hesitate to engage law enforcement if needed during your travel in the U.S. </p>\n <p>If stopped by the police while driving, the driver is expected to stay in the car and wait for the police officer to come to the driver or passenger window. Turn on your interior car lights if it is dark, and keep your hands on the wheel so they remain visible. Do not attempt to exit the vehicle unless told to do so. It is expected for the driver to roll down the window the officer is at. When stopped you should stay calm, be polite and cooperative, and avoid making sudden movements. If you need to reach for your purse or wallet to present your identification, state what you are doing and wait for permission to do so. Often police will ask you to keep your hands out of your pockets and in view while speaking to them. This is in no way meant to be offensive but is for their peace of mind and your safety. American police are <b>always</b> armed on duty and will respond with force if they believe you present an immediate threat to them or to the public. Do not act aggressively or angrily, as that can and will make a police officer suspicious at worst, or at best will make the officer disinclined towards leniency. Contrary to many sensationalized media reports, very few officers have racial prejudices, at least that they allow to impact their work, but you do <b>not</b> want to be on the wrong side of one that does, as officers that abuse their power very often see little to no punishment for their actions so long as they can make a case that you were deemed to be a threat, which is <b>very easy</b> for them to do under the present American justice system. Patrol stops typically result in a written citation for a driving offense, or sometimes a simple verbal warning if the offense was minor, as long as you remain appropriately cooperative. If they ask to search your vehicle, you may have the right to refuse it. Be aware that the odor of illegal substances is considered probable cause for a search under the laws of most U.S. states. Always be polite and calm, and if you believe you are being treated unfairly, ask the officer if you can speak with a supervisor. </p>\n <p>If you are being detained, unlike in many other nations, in the U.S. an individual arrested or detained for an alleged crime is <b>entitled</b> to the services of an attorney, even if you are unable to afford one, in which case one will be appointed for you. All States directly employ licensed attorneys as 'public defenders' precisely for this purpose. Additionally, law enforcement in most cases may not detain a person for more than 24 hours without formally charging (arraigning) that person with a crime. This is true even if you are not a citizen or legal resident of the U.S. </p>\n <p><b>Do not offer bribes</b> to a police officer in any way or under any circumstances. While bribery may be expected in other countries, the opposite is true in most parts of the US; bribery is actually a crime for which one can <i>and will</i> be arrested and detained. Foreigners are seldom given the benefit of the doubt if they are from a country where bribery is common. Even a vague gesture that could be interpreted as an attempt at bribery will offend the officer. If you need to pay a fine, the officer can direct you to the appropriate police station, courthouse, or government office. Most minor traffic infractions can be paid by mail. Don't even think about paying a fine directly to the officer who cited you, since that will probably be interpreted as a bribe. An exception to this rule is found in <span>Montana</span>, where fines can be paid to the officer by cash, check, or even a credit or debit card. There are a few places though where police corruption tends to be more common of an issue, such as <span>Chicago</span> or <span>Detroit</span>. If you do pay a bribe in one of those cities, be aware it may be a sting operation, as those cities are aware about the high amounts of dishonesty and are trying to lower it every chance they get. </p>\n <h3> <span>Disabled</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>People with disabilities are treated with respect and kindness in the US. Asking someone what their disability is, how they got it, etc is considered rude. Only close friends should really ask. Shaming or mocking those with disabilities is not acceptable. Service dogs are often used for those not only with physical disabilities, but also invisible mental or social disabilities. Petting these dogs, distracting or taking photos of them without permission is frowned upon. You are expected to ignore these dogs unless told otherwise. If you must, ask the person questions without distracting the animal. They are working dogs, not necessarily pets. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Texting and driving</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Distracted driving is a major problem in the United States, but despite the high dangers, <b>Texting and driving is not considered illegal under federal law</b>. But each state, territory, and Washington D.C. has laws on distracted driving. In some states, if you kill someone while texting and driving, you can get charged, and punished for murder. According to the <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/cellphone_laws.html>Governors Highway Safety Administration</a>, no state, territory, nor Washington D.C. except Illinois bans all uses of cellphone while driving. So when driving or crossing the street, it's best to be aware of distracted driving. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>911 Emergency services</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>During any emergency, dialing <b>911</b> (pronounced \"nine-one-one\") on any telephone will connect you to a dispatcher for the emergency services in the area (police, fire, ambulance, etc). Calls to 911 are free from pay phones and any mobile phone capable of connecting to any local carrier. Give the facts, the dispatchers will send help. With a landline, the 911 operator can almost certainly trace your line instantly and pinpoint the exact structure you are calling from. When it comes to mobile phones, virtually all mobile phones have incorporated Enhanced 911 (or E-911) that will send a GPS location during the call that the operator can direct units to that location even if the caller is incapacitated. There may be cases where you may be connected to the regional office for the state police or highway patrol, which will then have to transfer you to the appropriate local agency once they talk to you and determine what you need. There are also cases where the complete opposite will occur where you will be transferred from a local office to a regional office if the location is under a different jurisdiction (ex. a state highway). Regardless, it is important to always give your location and a reference when calling 911, as well as answer to the best of your ability all questions that you are asked. </p>\n <p>If you are staying in one area, it may be helpful to have the phone numbers for the local emergency services so as to get through directly to the local dispatch. Moreover, in most locations, 911 calls are recorded and are open public records, while the conversation with the local emergency dispatchers cannot be accessed by the public. Remember that if you dial emergency dispatchers directly instead of through 911, the operator may not be able to trace your location. </p>\n <p>If you speak a language other than English or Spanish, it is not likely that the dispatcher you reach will be able to understand. Stay on the line and the dispatcher will open up a conference call with a translator who can help. Language barriers are not a reason to forgo calling 911 in the United States. In any case, your location can be determined and some type of help, often a police officer, will be sent to you to determine the problem. </p>\n <p>All US carriers automatically redirect 112 calls (the standard emergency number for GSM devices) to 911 and all 911 calls will go through even if it must connect to a different carrier or your service has been suspended. </p>\n <p>As with most countries, misuse of the emergency services number will result in, at the very least, a call back from authorities; if particularly egregious, you will be heavily fined or even arrested. With that being said, if you end up pocket dialing 911, which has become more common, let the dispatcher know that you are not dealing with an emergency instead of hanging up so that someone is not sent to deal with the situation. Dispatchers are aware that these mistakes happen. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Border Patrol</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>You may encounter the United States Border Patrol if you're transiting through or visiting cities geographically close to Canada (such as <span>Detroit</span>) or Mexico (<span>San Diego</span>) as well as in Southern coastal areas (<span>Florida Keys</span>). Border Patrol has the authority to verify immigration status and enforce immigration laws in places designated as \"border zones\" — generally within 40 miles of Canada and 75-100 miles of Mexico (although the law allows for 100 miles from any border, including international bodies of water like the seas and Great Lakes; this includes the entirety of some states and the majority of population centers). Border patrol is visible near Canada, though less so than on the southern border, (with guards primarily checking domestic long distance buses, Amtrak trains and their associated terminals, and rarely air travelers on arrival or departure). On the border with Mexico and in Southern coastal areas, systematic vehicle checkpoints or being pulled over by Border Patrol for a document check is much more common. </p>\n <p>Foreign nationals are legally required to have a passport, visa, and I-94(W) entry record (or Green Card) in their possession at all times. Consequences for not having them during a document check may be severe; you may be delayed or detained until your status can be verified. Long-term visa holders and permanent residents have been fined, or in extreme cases had their visas canceled for being found without their documents. If your documents are in order, you generally won't be questioned. Even US citizens are increasingly being advised to carry proof of citizenship, or at the very least identification of some kind, in areas under Border Patrol jurisdiction. </p>\n <p>Border Patrol does not have much of a presence outside the border zones; its inland counterpart, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, generally doesn't target tourists unless it suspects them of trying to work during their tourist visits. In most states, police and other local authorities cannot question you about your immigration status or ask to see passports or visas unless you're arrested and charged with a crime, and then only for the purpose of connecting you with a representative from your country's embassy or diplomatic mission. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Natural disasters</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The U.S. is a huge country with varied geography, and parts of it are occasionally affected by natural disasters: <b>hurricanes</b> in June through November in the Gulf and Atlantic coastal states, including <span>Florida</span>, extreme heat throughout the country, <b>blizzards and extreme cold in the far north, large and violent </b>tornadoes<b> mostly in the <span>Great Plains</span>, the Mid-West, and the South, </b>floods<b> in areas all over the United States, </b>wildfires<b> in the late summer and early fall in the west, </b>dust storms<b> in any arid areas, and tsunamis, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions in the west, as well as large thunderstorms throughout the country. See the regions in question for more details. </b></p>\n <p>Because tornadoes are so common between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains, this area has earned itself the colloquial name <b>Tornado Alley</b>. The west of the country sits along the pacific ring of fire, and as a result, is an area very prone to tectonic and geothermal disasters. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Gay and lesbian</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Homosexuality is legal between consenting adults in all states as of 2003, and same-sex marriage was legalized in all states in 2015. Some states and cities have anti-discrimination codes, including public accommodations in hotels, restaurants and transportation and some states don't have it. Some Americans take a live-and-let-live approach to sexuality, but there are many significant exceptions. In a lot of regions of the US it is emphatically discouraged to open about one's sexual orientation and you will receive unwanted attention, remarks, threats, violent attacks, be physically attacked with police unsympathetic to your need for help or complicit, and be refused service. A significant amount of this occurs in <span>Texas</span>, <span>Wyoming</span>, the <span>Midwest</span> and the <span><b>South</b></span>. Attitudes toward homosexuality vary widely in regions with a reputation for tolerance. Tolerance is in some major cities throughout the country specifically around the Pacific Coast, some parts of the <span>Northeast</span> and <span>Hawaii</span>. Gay-friendly destinations include <span>New York</span>'s <span>Chelsea</span>, <span>Rochester</span> in Western <span>New York State</span>, <span>Cape Cod</span> in <span>Massachusetts</span>, <span>Chicago</span>'s <span>Boystown</span>, <span>Seattle</span>'s <span>Capitol Hill</span>, <span>San Francisco</span>'s <span>Castro Street</span>, <span>Washington</span>'s <span>Dupont Circle</span>, <span>Miami Beach</span>'s <span>South Beach</span>, <span>Atlanta</span>'s <span>Midtown</span> and <span>Los Angeles</span>' <span>West Hollywood</span>. <span>Massachusetts</span> is sometimes tolerant depending on whether or not you are in a strongly religious area, which many areas of Massachusetts are. An increasing number of resort areas are known as gay-friendly, including <span>Fire Island</span>, <span>Key West</span>, <span>Asheville</span>, <span>Provincetown</span>, <span>Ogunquit</span>, <span>Rehoboth Beach</span>, <span>Saugatuck</span>, and parts of <span>Asbury Park</span>. In a few smaller cities, there are neighborhoods where gay people tend to congregate and have resource centers for LGBT people. Some gay-friendly businesses like to advertise themselves as such with a rainbow flag or a small pink triangle or three-vertical-striped sticker in the window. Men planning to engage in any sex, should be aware the heightened risk of HIV and other infections in the United States. A gay American man is 44 times more likely to contract HIV than a heterosexual one, and 46 times more likely to contract syphilis. This risk grows greatly among men likely to engage in one-night stands and other higher-risk behavior. In a nation where 0.5% of the population are HIV-positive, unprotected sex is a very real risk. <b>Precautions, including safer sex, are strongly advised during your stay.</b> Most cities have affordable or free testing and treatment centers for STIs at least for gay men, though hours may be limited and waits may be long. Lesbians and trans face the same risk. The life-long repercussions of HIV or other STIs aren't covered by healthcare providers and seeking health care elsewhere can be very pricey. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Illicit drugs</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Street drugs, including but not limited to cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamines, are illegal under federal law throughout the US. </p>\n <p>Marijuana use is more widely accepted than other drugs. Although a few states have passed laws legalizing the medical and recreational use of marijuana, this will not protect any foreign citizen caught in possession. Outside of drug-using circles, most Americans frown upon illicit drug use regardless of quantity. This is especially true in more conservative jurisdictions. And travelers would be wise to avoid using such substances in the United States, even in the jurisdictions that allow it. Penalties can be very severe, and can include mandatory minimum jail terms for possession of personal quantities in some states. Also, ANY drug possession near a school, however slight the quantity, will land you a heavy jail term. Attempting to bring any quantity into the US posses a serious risk of being arrested for \"trafficking\". </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Legal marijuana</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>Notable exceptions to the precautions above are the states of <span>Alaska</span>, <span>California</span>, <span>Colorado</span>, <span>Maine</span>, <span>Michigan</span>, <span>Massachusetts</span>, <span>Nevada</span>, <span>Oregon</span> and <span>Washington</span>, the District of Columbia (<span>Washington, D.C.</span>) and several recognized Indian Reservations, which have all recently legalized recreational use of marijuana. According to these new local laws, you can possess up to 1 ounce (8 ounces in Oregon, 2.5 ounces in the city of Portland, Maine, 2.5 ounces in Michigan and 2 ounces in Washington D.C.) of marijuana from a <b>licensed seller</b> and use it personally if you are over 21 years old. Indian Reservations have recently been allowed by the Federal government to regulate cannabis on their recognized reservation, so laws within the reservation vary widely, and can be different from state laws. Example; while cannabis is legal in the state of Washington, the Yakima Nation (an Indian reservation in Washington State) declares cannabis illegal on their land. So by default, both federal and laws of the Indian Reservation apply. However, use on public streets or inside public buildings is illegal, so if you do use it, use it in private. Law enforcement usually ignores marijuana use on private property (i.e., inside someone's home), but caution should be exercised as police <i>can</i> arrest you for marijuana use in states where it is not legal, and drug crimes can carry surprisingly stiff sentences and will result in deportation for foreigners. </p>\n <p>The federal government of the United States still considers marijuana illegal, so the use is still illegal in territory under direct federal government jurisdiction within states where marijuana use has legalized such as the Lewis-McChord Military Reservation in Washington state, and all National Parks, National Forests, and other public lands under federal jurisdition. Likewise, mailing of marijuana from Washington state to Colorado through the US Postal Service or bringing in some 'BC Bud' from British Columbia to Washington state is still illegal. The future of these laws is uncertain, but for now, they stand (with the exceptions in recognized Indian Reservations and federal territory). </p>\n <p>Marijuana possession and use is still illegal everywhere else, so <b>do NOT</b> under any circumstances bring marijuana into any U.S. jurisdiction where it is illegal, nor across adjacent international borders. This includes any Indian Reservation that deems it illegal on their land as you will risk facing criminal charges if you are caught with it. Depending on which country of your residence or you're traveling to after leaving the U.S., you may face criminal charges in your home country (or a third country) if found in possession of cannabis (or even in very small amounts) on arrival from the U.S. or having it in your urine or through other means of testing for drug use from a person's body, even if it was completely consumed in the U.S. prior to departure. The US reports crimes to other countries <i><b>even ones who enforce the death penalty for drug offences</b></i> so keep that in mind. </p>\n <p>Do <i>not</i> bring cannabis or any other federally illegal drug onto any Federal enclave, as federal drug laws are heavily enforced. </p>\n <h3> <span>Racism</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Most travelers to the US will not encounter overt racism, but latent racism still exists. Certain towns and cities have \"no-go\" areas for certain ethnicities, where hostility can be felt, although tourists are unlikely to travel to such localities and even unlikelier to face actual harm. There is an <i>extremely</i> small chance of running into someone who is a member of a supremacist group such as, the <i>Ku Klux Klan</i> or other \"Neo-Nazi\" or various other hate groups. Symbols like swastikas and other Nazi imagery are legal in the US, and may be found in tattoo art among members. However, they usually cover these up in public to avoid drawing hostility from others. For the most part, racist hate groups tend to prefer to be reclusive due to the mainstream unpopularity of their views. Most such groups choose to inhabit remote, rural, isolated areas (some of which may be crudely constructed compounds) that are difficult for outsiders to come upon incidentally. Occasionally, they may appear in public just to exercise their \"free speech rights\", even if they don't intend to commit any violent or obviously illegal acts. </p>\n <h3> <span>Islam</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Islam is generally less prevalent in the United States than in many other Western countries This fact, along with well-publicized terrorist attacks performed by such extremist groups as ISIS and al-Qaeda, means some Americans harbor resentment towards Muslims and Islam, particularly in rural and suburban areas. However, this is not necessarily a majority view, especially in larger cities. Additionally, Muslims are generally not discriminated against on a personal level, and hate crimes are very rare. However, Muslims should use special caution and consideration when traveling in public at night, while wearing traditional or religious apparel, or while in areas outside of large cities. </p>\n <h3> <span>Judaism</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Although the USA has always been a safe and welcoming place for Jewish residents and visitors and anti-Semitic hate crimes are extremely rare, anti-Semitism has been on the increase over the past two decades and observant Jews should exercise special caution and consideration when traveling in public while wearing traditional or religious apparel, particularly in inner-city urban areas, on university campuses, and areas where extreme left or right-wing views are common. There have been several high-profile attacks on Jews, including recent synagogue shootings in Pittsburgh and San Diego. If you ever feel like you're in danger call 911 immediately. </p>\n <h3> <span>Curfew</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Some cities don't allow minors below a certain age to wander alone after a certain hour at night, unless accompanied by a legal guardian. Similar rules may apply to driving. </p>\n <h3> <span>Animals</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>It is illegal to hunt, kill, or keep any of a bald eagle's feathers. Keeping its feathers will result in a $100,000 fine for each feather you possess. As well as a year in prison, repeated offenses will change your sentence. However, Indian reservations are somewhat excluded from the possession of bald eagle feathers. <b>But you must have a certification of tribal membership and the appropriate registration license to possess one</b>. If not, federal law applies. The U.S. has one of the highest populations of venomous snakes (32), and a high number of potentially dangerous animals compared to many other countries. Please exhibit caution in any wilder areas of the country (even suburban areas.). Animal fighting and abuse is illegal. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Prostitution</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Prostitution is not prohibited by Federal law. States, Territories, and the Federal District are allowed to make their own laws. Even so, prostitution remains illegal in all areas except at licensed brothels in rural Nevada counties. Prostitution remains illegal in Las Vegas and Reno, <span>Nevada</span>, and street-walking prostitutes are always illegal. Elsewhere in the US, tolerance and enforcement of prostitution laws vary considerably, but be aware that police routinely engage in \"sting\" operations in which an officer may pose as a prostitute to catch and arrest persons offering to pay for sex. This is not considered entrapment by US laws since the arrested person was consciously intending to commit an illegal act. </p>\n <h3> <span>Firearms</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Legal ownership of firearms is supported by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution, most (but not all) of the fifty states have similar wording in their state constitutions. Because of this, the U.S. has become a major destination for \"Gun tourism\", and currently the largest destination. </p>\n <p>Many Americans (but certainly not all) own a firearm, and firearm ownership is legal in all jurisdictions with varying degrees of restriction by State, Territory, and Federal District. Legally carried firearms can range from hunting rifles and shotguns to revolvers and semi-automatic handguns. </p>\n <p>Non-immigrant aliens that are in the country for fewer than 180 days cannot possess a firearm or ammunition, unless they came here specifically for hunting or sporting purposes, <i>or</i> they have a valid hunting license from the state they are visiting. Passport + Visa + State Issued Hunting License = firearm possession / use. Entry in a recognized shooting competition can substitute for the hunting license. Anything else is strictly illegal. </p>\n <p>The vast majority of Americans are non-violent except in self defense; they are responsible with their firearms and use/carry them appropriately and within the limits of the law. All States have laws regarding self defense which allow a person to use force, up to and including deadly force, in defense of themselves or others when in reasonable fear of serious bodily injury or death. This right to self-defense, <b>including</b> armed force, extends to protection of one's home, and, in some states, to other types of personal property. </p>\n <p>Your chances of a firearm-related injury in the U.S.A. are <b>very low</b>, but please keep the following in mind: </p>\n <p>If you come from a country where firearm ownership is heavily restricted, discouraged or prohibited, there is a possibility that your American host will offer to take you shooting. On a shooting trip, your host will most likely explain basic firearm safety and quiz you on it before allowing you to handle their guns. They may also watch you closely and point out any accidental safety violations. This is all done out of gun safety concerns, and should never be interpreted as impertinent or disrespectful. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Self-Defense</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Laws about self defense vary between states and depending on the situation can allow for very loose or very strict definitions of what calls for it. California or New York are examples of states where it requires more immediate danger to be allowed. Attitudes taken in the <span>South</span>, <span>Texas</span>, and <span>Rocky Mountains (United States of America)</span>, even tresspasers are seen as dangerous on private property and may be shot if seen as a threat. All States do allow for deadly force from citizens and police officers if they are in fear of their life. Read up on the policies before coming to know what the laws your State have on defending yourself. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Mass Shootings</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Incidents of mass shootings happen, but account for a small percentage of homicide deaths in the country.

This is due to Americans being more likely to have multiple partners at younger ages (down to 12 years of age,) than residents of Canada or Western Europe. </p>\n <p>Two diseases that, while rare, are worth becoming educated about are <b>rabies</b> and <b>Lyme disease</b>. Rabies is more prevalent in eastern regions of the country and may be contracted from animal bites; if you are bitten by any mammal see a doctor quickly—do not wait for symptoms. Lyme disease is spread via the deer tick, which are prevalent in the woodlands and open fields of many rural areas. When venturing into the outdoors, it is a good idea to apply an insect repellent onto exposed skin surfaces that is effective against deer ticks. </p>\n <p>Other diseases that are endemic within the United States, but are of far less concern, include <b>Hantaviral Pulmonary Syndrome</b> (found in western regions), Dengue fever (in areas from the southern Mid-West down to the Gulf and Hawaii,) Chikungunya (almost all regions,) Bubonic Plague (Pacific Northwest,) <b>Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever</b> (mostly in the Rocky Mountain region), <b>West Nile Virus</b> (all regions)and <b>Eastern/Western Equine Encephalitis</b> (particularly in the mid-west region). </p>\n <p>All of the above listed diseases are extraordinarily rare and the medical system of the United States is very much capable of handling any of these when necessary. </p>\n <p>For the latest in traveler's health information pertaining to the United States, including advisories and recommendations, visit the <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/unitedstates.aspx><b>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website</b>.</a></p>\n <h3> <span>Health care</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Health care in America is arguably the best but among the most expensive in the world. The vast majority of working Americans have health insurance for themselves and their family, for those who don't the Affordable Care Act (commonly called \"Obamacare\" by Americans) enacted by President Barack Obama in 2010 helped to alleviate the problem. Americans generally use private health insurance, paid either by their employer or out of their own pocket; some risk paying high hospital bills themselves, or depend on government subsidized health plans. If you are at least 65, then your medical coverage is covered through the national Medicare system. As a traveler you should have <span>travel insurance</span> or you will potentially face very high costs if you need medical care. </p>\n <p>Most metropolitan areas will have a mix of public and private hospitals, and in turn, US private hospitals can be either non-profit or for-profit. Public hospitals located in wealthy suburbs can be as good as private ones, but in poorer inner-city areas, public hospitals are usually overcrowded and run-down and should be avoided by tourists. However, many public hospitals are also the Level I regional trauma centers for their respective metro areas (i.e., they guarantee 24-hour on-site availability of all major types of medical specialists), which means that you will be taken there if critically injured. </p>\n <p>In a life-threatening emergency, call 911 to summon an ambulance to take you to the nearest <b>hospital emergency room</b> (\"ER\"), or in less urgent situations get to the hospital yourself and register at the ER's front desk. Emergency rooms will treat patients without regard to their ability to pay, but you will still be presented with a bill for all care. Note: if you use an ambulance to get to a hospital you will have to pay extra for that. <i>Do not</i> use ERs for non-emergency walk-in care. Not only can this be 3-4 times more expensive than other options, but you will often wait many hours (or days) before being treated, as the staff will give priority to patients with urgent needs. In most areas, the charge for an emergency room visit starts around $500, in addition to any specific services or medications you may require. Most urban areas have minor emergency centers (also called \"urgent care\", etc.) for medical situations where a fully equipped emergency room would be excessive, such as superficial lacerations. However, their hours may be limited, and few are open overnight. </p>\n <p>Walk-in <b>clinics</b> are another place for travelers to find routine medical care, letting patients see a doctor or nurse-practitioner without an appointment (but often with a bit of a wait). They are typically very up-front about fees, and always accept credit cards. To find one, check the yellow pages under \"Clinics\", or call a major hospital and ask. Make sure to tell the clerk you will be paying \"out of pocket\"; if they assume an insurance company will be paying for it, they may order tests that are not medically essential and in some cases bill for services that aren't actually provided. </p>\n <p><b>Dentists</b> are readily available throughout the United States (again, see the yellow pages). Dental offices are accustomed to explaining fees over the phone, and most will accept credit cards. Be prepared to pay for all services up front as this is a common requirement for most dental practices. </p>\n <p>Please note the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly referred to by Americans as <b>Obamacare</b> (named after the U.S. President Barack Obama who started the idea) is a law that requires everyone to have affordable health insurance to avoid paying a hefty price on their medical bills. It took effect March 1, 2014. It is however, <b>not applicable</b> to U.S. visitors so if you get sick you have to pay full price for medical bills. </p>\n <p>Most counties and cities have a government-supported clinic offering free or low-cost testing and treatment for <b>sexually transmitted diseases</b>; call the Health Department for the county you are in for more details. Many county clinics offer primary health care services as well, however these services are geared towards low-income residents and not foreign travelers. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Restrooms/Toilets</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The full-time restroom attendants often seen in certain European countries are extremely rare in the US. Some facilities may be pristine, such as in upscale shopping malls, fine restaurants, or commercial office buildings. Others will be shockingly unkempt, such as at many gas stations and bars. Public universities and big box retail stores will have a medium level of cleanliness. Nearly all public buildings are required to have restrooms accessible to the disabled. Many restrooms increasingly offer baby changing stations in both the men's and women's restrooms (especially in shopping centers and restaurants). A few places offer a separate, third \"family\" restroom which is single-occupancy but spacious. For little children who need to be monitored or assisted, it's generally acceptable for them to use the restroom of the parent they're with (little girls can go with dad to the men's room, and vice versa). The other way around (dad going to the ladies' room) is usually not okay. North Carolina had a law that transgender people use the bathrooms that match their biological sex, but it was repealed in March of 2017, a year after having been passed. </p>\n <h3> <span>Water</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Tap water is generally chlorinated and may also include fluorine. Nevertheless, some Americans use filter pitchers (common brands for both include <i>Brita</i> and <i>Pur</i>). Although tap water is not dangerous, some Americans prefer to filter (and sometimes boil) tap water before drinking. It has more to do with taste than actual safety. </p>\n <p>Ice in restaurants is typically made with ice machines. Water is always served for free in restaurants. </p>\n <p>Truly isolated rural areas or sources in condemned buildings may be suspect water sources-use your best judgement-but this is exceptionally rare. </p>\n <p>While tap water in most urban and suburban areas is safe to drink, many Americans are more comfortable drinking either filtered or bottled water. This should not be seen as a sign that the water is unsafe, rather that some prefer to always have portable bottled water on hand. You can carry a reusable water bottle (heavy plastic or metal) and refill with water from public drinking fountains, some of which are even now filtered for taste, or have a vertical spout to make dispensing water directly into a bottle easier. </p>\n <p>These considerations, of course, bar natural disasters or other disturbances to the water supply system. Again, use your best judgement. After an earthquake or a tornado or the like you can check with the local authority, and they will have maps zoned out where unsafe water may be found. Many cities water municipal properties with 'greywater' (reclaimed or otherwise not-processed) water, and there will be signs stating that the water is unsafe to drink from the sprayers. This should not be a huge problem, as parks tend to have drinking water fountains if you find yourself in a desperate situation. </p>\n <p>In hot states such as Arizona and New Mexico, all businesses must provide tap water upon request. </p>\n <h2> <span>Cope</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <h3> <span>News</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>News media in the U.S. is almost entirely privately-owned and profit-driven, and so conforms itself to its consumers and advertisers. The result is a wide range of information and opinion, some of it focused entirely on political ideology or special interests, with others attempting to be broad and impartial to appeal to a wide audience. As a very general rule (there are always exceptions) radio news has right-wing opinions, while print and cable news has a left-wing inclination. Other publications or channels will offer a range of right, center, and left opinions, but this is relatively uncommon. </p>\n <h4> <span>Newspapers</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>The five most important newspapers are as follows: </p>\n <p>Most good newsstands (especially at major airports) always carry the NYT, the WSJ, and USA Today, as well as one or more local newspapers. In addition, they may also carry either the LA Times or the Washington Post (depending on whether they sit west or east of the Mississippi River). Local newspapers can generally be found at sidewalk vending machines in the cities they cover, together with USA Today. Starbucks Coffee shops and other coffee houses often also carry newspapers. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Cable News Channels</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <h3> <span>Dress</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Today, dress in the US tends to be fairly casual. For everyday clothes, jeans and T-shirts are generally acceptable, as are shorts when the weather is suitable. Sneakers (athletic shoes) are common; flip-flops, tank tops, and sandals are also popular in warm weather. </p>\n <p>At the workplace, business casual (slacks, understated collared shirts without a tie, and non-athletic shoes) is now the default at many companies; more traditional industries (e.g. finance, legal, and insurance) still require suits and ties, while others (e.g. computer software) are even more casual, allowing jeans and even shorts. </p>\n <p>When dressing up for nice restaurants or upscale entertainment, a pair of nice slacks, a collared shirt, and dress shoes will work almost everywhere. Ties for men are rarely necessary, but jackets are occasionally required for very upscale restaurants in big cities. </p>\n <p>At the beach or pool, men prefer loose bathing trunks or boardshorts, and women wear bikinis or one-piece swimsuits. Nude bathing is allowed at certain private beaches or resorts; female toplessness is legal in most states. Many establishments, such as water parks, will enforce rules on improper swimwear; for example, insufficient covering of the intimate parts or offensive language. Staff members may ask you to either change into swimwear more appropriate or be escorted out of the park (typically without a refund). </p>\n <p>Generally, Americans accept religious attire such as hijab, yarmulke, and burqa without comment. However, do be aware that in places of heightened security such as banks, municipal buildings, and so on, wearing clothing which covers the face may be regarded as suspicious behavior. If you do this, use additional caution and calmly explain if confronted. </p>\n <h2> <span>Respect</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/vHwEO2e0KeZyIqEJLn-dFENI83DHB9OeAonkMcnyKDTTgWRDEL0=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/4qi4UVfZeHGrAQTMGXDnQY3fGBHAHP4IpHnpXs-kFvC0PPqplL8=/upload/en/b/b5/BurningMan-2003.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>Burning Man</span>, <span>Nevada</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The number one rule of respect among Americans is that it must be earned by your actions and integrity.

You must dial all seven digits even if the YYY portion is the same as the line you are calling from. The numbers XXX denote the <b>area code</b>. Densely populated areas often have several area codes (e.g. the six area codes within the borders of New York City), while some sparsely-populated states will have one or two codes for the entire state (e.g. Montana). </p>\n <p>Ordinarily, if the number you are dialing is within the same area code as the one for the line you are dialing from, dial YYY-ZZZZ; otherwise, dial 1-XXX-YYY-ZZZZ. However, many metropolitan areas, and even some entire states (such as Maryland and West Virginia) have implemented <b>10-digit dialing</b>, where all local calls must be dialed as XXX-YYY-ZZZZ. (In such areas, you must still dial \"1\" to distinguish long-distance calls.) Mobile phones are much simpler and can be dialed with all 10 digits regardless of whether the call is local or long distance. </p>\n <p>You may occasionally see phone numbers for business which spell out words, such as \"1-800-FLOWERS\". Almost all phones have letters written on each number (\"2\" is \"ABC\", \"3\" is \"DEF\", etc.) which you use to dial the number; for example, \"FLOWERS\" becomes \"356-9377\". This is a legacy of the old alphabet letter codes which were previously used for telephone exchanges. In the case of mobile phones, most feature phones (i.e., not smartphones) have the letters printed along with the numbers. As for smartphones, most touchscreen phones have virtual phone keypads that display the corresponding letters along with the numbers. Smartphones without touchscreens, such as some older BlackBerry devices, often allow you to enter letters as part of a phone number. In either case, entering \"1-800-FLOWERS\" and pressing the send button should connect you to that business. </p>\n <p><b>Long-distance</b> calls are calls to lines outside the \"local calling area\" of the line from which you are dialing. The long-distance prefix (in some countries called the \"trunk\" prefix) in the U.S. is \"1\", so a long-distance call should be dialed 1-XXX-YYY-ZZZZ. As with local calls, dialing incorrectly will result in an automated message informing you how to properly dial the number. Mobile phones typically do not require you to dial \"1\" for long-distance. </p>\n <p>Canada and certain Caribbean islands also participate in the NANP. This means they can be dialed using \"1\" as if they were in the U.S., although the call will be billed at international rates. As a general rule, calls to Canada are more expensive than U.S. domestic calls, but cheaper than calls to other countries. Calls to other locations require using the international access code (\"011\") followed by the country code of the destination number. For example, a call from the United States to the British Museum in London would be dialed as 011-44-20-7323-8000. </p>\n <p>At some locations with internal phone systems (e.g. businesses and hotels), you will need to dial an access code (usually \"9\" or \"8\") to reach an outside line before dialing the number as usual. </p>\n <p>Numbers with the area code 800, 888, 877, 866, or 855 are <b>toll free</b> within the U.S, meaning that the cost of the call is paid by the recipient. Outside the country, dial 880, 881, 882, and 883 respectively, but these aren't toll free. The area code 900 is used for services with additional charges applied to the call (e.g. \"adult entertainment\"). This is also true of \"local\" seven-digit phone numbers starting with 976. </p>\n <p>Most visitor areas and some restaurants and bars have directories with two listings of telephone numbers (often split into two books): the <b>white pages</b>, for an alphabetical listing; and the <b>yellow pages</b>, an advertising-filled listing of business and service establishments by category (e.g. \"Taxicabs\"). Directory information can also be obtained by dialing <b>411</b> (for local numbers) or <b>1-area code-555-1212</b> (for other areas). If 411 doesn't work locally, try 555-1212 or 1-555-1212. Directory information is normally an extra cost call. As an alternative, directory information is available for free via 1-800-Free411, which is ad-supported. Information directories are also available online at each regional telephone company's web site (most often AT&amp;T, Verizon, or CenturyLink; also Frontier in West Virginia and FairPoint in northern New England), as well as www.free411.com. Although each claims to have all the local phone numbers of the others, using the site of the region you are searching for yields the best results (i.e. AT&amp;T for most of California, Verizon for the Northeast, etc.) Many residential land-line phones and all mobile phones are unlisted. </p>\n <p>Historically, <b>pay phones</b> were ubiquitous on sidewalks all over the United States, and commonplace in other places such as gas stations. After 2000, cell phone usage soared and pay phone usage collapsed, so the regional landline telecom monopolies exited the pay phone business. The small companies that took over the legacy pay phones have ripped out most of them and increased prices on the ones that remain. Today, prices are typically 50 cents for the first three minutes, and a quarter for each additional minute. You will probably have to enter a store or restaurant to find one, though some are against the outer wall of such businesses, usually in front, or near bus stops. Most pay phones are coin operated (quarters, dimes and nickels) and do not accept paper bills. An online directory of pay phones can be found at Pay Phone Directory <a target=_blank href=http://www.payphone-directory.org/ rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">[30]</a>. Dialing 9-1-1 to report an emergency is still a free call on pay phones, it's just a matter of locating one to use. </p>\n <p>Long-distance telephone <b>calling cards</b> are available at most convenience stores. Most calling cards have specific destinations in mind (domestic calls, calls to particular countries), so make sure you get the right card. Some cards may be refilled by phoning a number and giving your Visa/MasterCard number, but often operators refuse foreign cards for this purpose. Moreover, calls may cost more if a payphone or toll-free number is used or if a mobile number is dialed or if more calls are made (rather than few but longer calls). </p>\n <p>Another option is using a virtual number service.<a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.kolmee.com/en/virtual-number-from?dest=us\">[31]</a> That way you can avoid paying for roaming. </p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty> <span>Mobile phones</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>American <b>mobile phone services</b> (known as <i>cell phones</i> regardless of the technology used) are not very compatible with those offered abroad. While GSM has been gaining in popularity, the US uses the unusual 1900 and 850MHz frequencies; check with your operator or mobile phone dealer to see if your phone is a <b>tri-band</b> or <b>quad-band</b> model that will work here. Roaming fees for foreign mobiles are high and text messages may not always work due to compatibility issues between networks. </p>\n <p>Depending on the length of your trip and the amount of calling you plan on doing, it may be less expensive to obtain an American mobile phone. If you are arriving and departing from the same city, consider that most larger airports will have a boutique that rents mobile phones (rates start around $3/day). Alternatively, prepaid phones and top-up cards can be purchased at mobile phone boutiques and at many discount, electronics, office supply and convenience stores. A very basic mobile handset and credit for an hour or two's worth of calls can be had for under $40, though be aware that international calling will, if it is in fact available, use up those credits <i>much</i> more quickly than a domestic call. It is possible to purchase a prepaid SIM card for an unlocked mobile, although these are not nearly as common in the United States as in other countries so you will probably have to purchase it from a GSM provider's boutique. The four major national carriers are AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile, which operate boutiques in most, if not all, metropolitan areas and offer pre-paid service. Historically, the AT&amp;T and T-Mobile networks have used GSM, while Verizon and Sprint have used the different CDMA standard (whose phones did not use SIM cards). Verizon, however, is discontinuing their CDMA network and allowing GSM only devices to use their network. Today, all four carriers are quickly migrating to the newer LTE standard (which uses SIM cards), and most Verizon and Sprint phones support LTE, CDMA, and GSM. Other providers of mobile phone service include TracFone, Boost Mobile, Simple Mobile, and various regional operators. To work out whether a regional operator might work better (as their deals are more flexible over their local areas of service) OpenSignal provide independent <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://opensignal.com/networks/usa/verizon-wireless-coverage>US coverage maps</a>. </p>\n <p>Unlike in many countries, there is no surcharge for dialing a mobile phone (calls to mobile phones are charged the same as calls to land lines outside your geographic area), but on the other hand mobile phone users are charged for incoming <i>and</i> outgoing calls and SMS (you won't be able to contact someone who does not have sufficient balance to receive phone calls). Numbers that are toll-free from land lines, however, are not free when dialed from a mobile phone. Packages as low as $25/month are available to allow you to make hundreds of minutes worth of calls. Take note that a failed attempt at making a call (or a \"missed call\") will be deducted from your balance since you are charged from the moment you dial. </p>\n <p>The US has moved away from contracts and it is more common to pay your phone through an installment plan or lease the device. Most postpaid plans offer unlimited calling, SMS, and data, but limit the speed of certain content or add extra features if you pay more. With the removal of contracts, the phone can be purchased either upfront, through an interest-free installment plan for a 24 month period, or leased with certain conditions. Instead of paying a fee to leave, the remaining balance on the phone is charged. </p>\n <p>Conversely, if you are only going to be in the US for a short period (eg a week or less), some carriers (most notably T-Mobile) offer a plan that allows unlimited calling, texting, and data for $2-3 per day. This will not include international calling, however. </p>\n <h3> <span>By mail</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <h4> <span>Overview</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/MTMJJmgANHwr0RnaRF-tIjhg1dasW5hYu9K4cuqEHJSaQWFf4hA=/en/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/jbyLZPzx99m1i-ted-u1LzwgQhH6Olwx1bX7bgBfXkdp5qOhCkk=/upload/shared//thumb/6/6f/Selfservicekiosk.JPG/390px-Selfservicekiosk.JPG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>A USPS Self-Service Kiosk at a post office.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Each post office has different hours, but most are open 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Saturday. In high crime areas, post offices are completely closed to the public when not open. In low crime areas, the lobby is divided into two areas. The retail counter area is closed after hours, but the rest of the lobby can be open 24/7 (or may only be open longer hours like 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.) and normally includes access to Post Office Boxes as well as at least one Self-Service Kiosk (SSK). The SSK is an easy-to-use self-service touchscreen kiosk that accepts credit cards. It can weigh packages and print out a variety of different types of postage and labels. </p>\n <h4> <span>Addressing</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>In general, the addressee's section of the piece of mail should appear as follows: </p>\n <p>(name of recipient) <br>\n (street address, which contains the house number and street name) <br>\n (apartment, suite or room number if any)<br>\n (city or town), (two digit state abbreviation) (ZIP code)<br>\n</p>\n <p>For example:<br>\n John &amp; Jane Doe <br>\n 555 Main St<br>\n Apt #1<br>\n Houston, TX 77002-0001<br>\n</p>\n <p>To send items to any destination within the U.S. by post, the most important item in the addressee's section of the mailpiece is the ZIP code (postal code). </p>\n <p>The importance of the ZIP code arises from the Postal Service's highly automated process for handling mail. USPS personnel dump all newly received mailpieces into a scanning machine that runs optical character recognition on the destination address and then sprays or prints a Intelligent Mail Barcode corresponding to the ZIP+4 code. The Intelligent Mail Barcode is then scanned by high-speed automatic sorting machines at each step in the system, in order to route the mailpiece into the bag or tray of the letter carrier whose route includes that ZIP+4 code. Thus, if the ZIP+4 code and Intelligent Mail Barcode are incorrect, the error will <i>not</i> be detected until the mailpiece gets to the wrong letter carrier. The USPS requires a particular combination of house number and street name to be unique within the same city, but <i>does not</i> require a street name to be unique across an entire metropolitan area. Since there are often many cities in a single metropolitan area that have streets with the same name, writing the correct ZIP code is essential to prompt delivery of your mailpiece. </p>\n <p>When you do not know of or are unsure of the correct ZIP code, visit <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input>USPS.com</a>, the website of the USPS. It enables users to look up ZIP codes by city and by street address. Entering a full street address may return a ZIP code (first 5 digits) and ZIP+4 (next 4 digits) to a total of 9 digits. The ZIP (first 5 digits) usually encompasses a greater area such as a section of a city, an entire town or across an expansive (rural) area encompassing several small towns. University campuses, large hospitals, governmental agencies, military bases, sections of the U.S. military or a single large building may have their own unique ZIP code and any mail sent to that particular ZIP code goes to that institution's internal mail room for onward delivery. Depending upon the complexity of a particular place, the unique ZIP+4 code (next for 4 digits) may correspond to anything from a segment along a letter carrier's route to the entire route (which may cover an entire small town); a group of apartments, offices or storefronts in a single address; an office within a specific building (which is often the case in big cities); or a department, office, mail stop or a building on an university campus or some large entity with its own unique zip code. </p>\n <p>The \"+4\" portion of the ZIP code is optional. For nearly all addresses, as long as the written address in its entirety corresponds to an actual and unique address, the OCR machine will be able to link it to that address, quickly identify the correct \"+4\" portion, and print the correct Intelligent Mail Barcode. But the ZIP code (the first 5 digits) is always necessary. In some areas, the same ZIP code may be used for multiple towns (for example, 19401 applies to Norristown and East Norriton, Pennsylvania), but a street name may occur multiple times in the ZIP code (there are two Montgomery Avenues in 19401, one in Norristown, the other in East Norriton), so be sure to use the correct town and use the ZIP+4, if possible. </p>\n <h4> <span>Pricing</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>First class (airmail) postcards and letters (if not oversized, or over one ounce/28.5 grams) are $1.15 internationally including to Canada and Mexico. It is no longer necessary to mark \"AIR MAIL\" on items going overseas as everything is now sent abroad on airplane by default. All addresses with a USPS ZIP code are considered \"domestic\", including <span>Alaska</span>, <span>Hawaii</span>, <span>Puerto Rico</span>, <span>U.S. Virgin Islands</span>, <span>Guam</span>, <span>American Samoa</span>, <span>Federated States of Micronesia</span>, <span>Marshall Islands</span>, <span>Palau</span>, U.S. military bases abroad (identified with an 'APO' or 'FPO' address)<a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=https://www.usps.com/ship/apo-fpo-dpo.htm>[33]</a>, U.S. Navy ships at sea (usually 'FPO' addresses) <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/lists/ship-fpo.asp>[34]</a> and U.S. diplomatic missions abroad ('DPO' addresses). Domestic postcards are sent for $0.35 (Jan. 2018) while a letter in an envelope weighing within 1 oz is mailed for $0.50 (Jan. 2018). If you put a solid object like a coin or a key in an envelope, you'll pay a surcharge. <a target=_blank rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" href=https://www.usps.com/business/prices.htm>[35]</a></p>\n <p>\"Forever\" stamps are always valid for the first ounce for all first-class domestic mail items, with no surcharge after a price increase. (For all other kinds of price increases and historically for first-class domestic mail price increases, the USPS sells one and two-cent stamps which must be added to cover the difference between the face value of stamps sold before an increase and the current rate.) However, Forever stamps are not valid for international use. </p>\n <p>If for whatever reason you have stamps that don't add up to the correct exact amount, you can try overpaying by adding one more stamp. The USPS stamp canceling machines are intelligent enough to recognize that fact and allow the mail piece through. </p>\n <p>Due to sagging demand, the USPS has taken away the vending machines through which one could formerly purchase a variety of pre-printed stamp booklets in post office lobbies. The SSKs as initially deployed could regularly dispense at least one type of pre-printed stamp booklet year-round, but that feature has been withdrawn as well. The USPS will still make stamp booklets available sometimes through the SSKs, but only on an intermittent and seasonal basis. </p>\n <p>Therefore, at this time, the <i>only</i> always-available method for buying postage at a post office when the retail counter is closed is to use the SSK in the lobby to print bar-coded postage labels.

There is no charge for this service. You just go to the main post office, wait in line, and they will give you your mail after showing ID such as a passport. </p>\n <p>John Doe <br>\n General Delivery <br>\n<span>Seattle</span>, <span>Washington</span> 98101-9999 <br>\n U.S.A. <br>\n</p>\n <p>The last four digits of the ZIP (postal) Code for General Delivery is always '9999'. If the city is large enough to have multiple post offices, <b>only one</b> (usually in the center of downtown) will have the General Delivery service. This means, for example, if you're staying in the Green Lake district of Seattle (a few miles north of downtown), you <b>cannot</b> receive your mail at the Green Lake Post Office, and must travel downtown to get it. On the other hand, if you're completely outside of the city of Seattle, and in a smaller town with only one post office, you can have it sent there. </p>\n <p>The two largest private courier services, UPS and FedEx, also have a \"Hold for Pickup\" option. Both can hold a package at the nearest depot, while FedEx can also hold packages at FedEx Office locations. </p>\n <h3> <span>By Internet</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Most Americans have Internet access, mostly in their homes and offices.

This scheme sets up a WiFi network—without a password and sometimes with a deceiving name— using their laptop/phone as a router to their laptop/phone's Internet connection, allowing them to record all information that passes through the connection or even (if they have expert computer skills) gain access to your computer's hard drive. Your best bet is to go into the business to find out what their WiFi network is named and always select \"public network\" if your computer prompts you while connecting (this prevents others on the network from 'seeing' your device and preventing any other device on the network from accessing your device). Make sure your computer has good antivirus protection and a good third-party (not just Windows) firewall as a safety precaution against unauthorized access to your device.

The <b><span>Appalachians</span></b> extend from Canada to <span>Alabama</span>, a few hundred miles west of the Atlantic Ocean. They are the oldest of the three ranges and offer spectacular sightseeing and excellent camping spots. The <b><span>Rockies</span></b> are, on average, the highest in North America, extending from Alaska to <span>New Mexico</span>, with many areas designated as <span>national parks</span> that offer hiking, camping, skiing, and sightseeing opportunities. The combined <b><span>Sierra Nevada</span></b> and <b><span>Cascade</span></b> ranges are the youngest. The Sierras extend across the \"backbone\" of <span>California</span>, with sites such as <span>Lake Tahoe</span> and <span>Yosemite National Park</span>, then give way to the even younger volcanic Cascade range, with some of the highest points in the country. </p>\n <p>In the center of the country is the <span>Great Plains</span>, which includes the entirety of <span>Oklahoma</span>, <span>Kansas</span>, <span>Nebraska</span>, <span>South Dakota</span>, <span>North Dakota</span>, and portions of the surrounding states. This region is characterized by long stretches of flat land, and areas of gentle rolling hills. It consists largely of farmland and prairie. </p>\n <p>The Gulf of Mexico is to the southeast of <span>Texas</span>, to the south of <span>Louisiana</span>, <span>Mississippi</span>, <span>Alabama</span> and <span>Florida</span>'s Panhandle, and constitutes the West Coast of Florida. </p>\n <p>The <span>Great Lakes</span> define much of the border between the eastern United States and Canada. More fresh water inland seas than lakes, they were formed by the pressure of retreating glaciers at the end of the last Ice Age. The five lakes span hundreds of miles, bordering the states of <span>Minnesota</span>, <span>Wisconsin</span>, <span>Illinois</span>, <span>Indiana</span>, <span>Michigan</span>, <span>Ohio</span>, <span>Pennsylvania</span> and <span>New York</span>, and their shores vary from pristine wilderness areas to industrial \"rust belt\" cities. </p>\n <h3> <span>Climate</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Although much of the U.S. has a <b>temperate</b> climate, there is also a wide variety from Arctic tundra in Alaska to the tropical weather in Hawaii and <span>South Florida</span>. The <span>Great Plains</span> are dry, flat and grassy, turning into <b>desert</b> in the far West and <b>Mediterranean</b> along the California coast. </p>\n <p>In the <span>winter</span>, major cities in the North and Midwest can see as much as 2 feet (61 cm) of snowfall in one day, with cold temperatures. Summers are humid, but mild. Temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C) sometimes invade the Midwest and Great Plains. Some areas in the northern plains can experience cold temperatures of −30 °F (−34 °C) during the winter. Temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C) sometimes reach as far south as <span>Oklahoma</span>. </p>\n <p>The climate of the <span>South</span> also varies. In the summer, it is hot and humid, but from October through April the weather can range from 60 °F (16 °C) to short cold spells of 20 °F (−7 °C) or so. </p>\n <p>The Great Plains and Midwestern states also experience <b><span>tornadoes</span></b> from the late spring to early fall, earlier in the south and later in the north. States along the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico may experience <b><span>hurricanes</span></b> between June and November. These intense and dangerous storms frequently miss the U.S. mainland, but evacuations are often ordered and should be heeded. </p>\n <p>The Rockies are cold and snowy. Some parts of the Rockies see over 500 inches (1,300 cm) of snow in a season. Even during the summer, temperatures are cool in the mountains, and snow can fall nearly year-round. It is dangerous to go up in the mountains unprepared in the winter and the roads through them can get very icy. </p>\n <p>The deserts of the <span>Southwest</span> are hot and dry during the summer, with temperatures often exceeding 100 °F (38 °C). Thunderstorms can be expected in the southwest frequently from July through September. Winters are mild, and snow is unusual. Average annual precipitation is low, usually less than 10 in (250 mm). </p>\n <p>Cool and damp weather is common much of the year in the coastal northwest (Oregon and Washington west of the Cascade Range, and the northern part of California west of the Coast Ranges/Cascades). Summers (July through September) are usually quite dry with low humidity, though, making it the ideal climate for outdoor activities. Rain is most frequent in winter, snow is rare, especially along the coast, and extreme temperatures are uncommon. Rain falls almost exclusively from late fall through early spring along the coast. East of the Cascades, the northwest is considerably drier. Much of the inland northwest is either semi-arid or desert, especially in Oregon. </p>\n <p>Northeastern and Upper Southern cities are known for summers with temperatures reaching into the 90s °F (32 °C) or more, with extremely high humidity, usually over 80%. This can be a drastic change from the Southwest. High humidity means that the temperature can feel hotter than actual readings. The Northeast also experiences snow, and at least once every few years there will be a dumping of the white stuff in enormous quantities. </p>\n <h3> <span>History</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <table><tbody><tr><td>United States historical travel topics:<br>\n<b><span>Indigenous nations</span> → <span>Pre-Civil War</span> → <span>Civil War</span> → <span>Old West</span> → <span>Industrialization</span> → <span>Postwar</span></b> </td></tr></tbody></table> <p><b>Native Americans</b>, or <b>American Indians</b>, arrived 13,500 to 16,000 years ago from migrating northeast Asian peoples crossing the Bering Strait into <span>Alaska</span>, and represented a wide variety of sophisticated societies that existed before the first arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century. The Mississippian cultures built huge settlements across the Southeast, and the Anasazi built elaborate cliff-side towns in the Southwest. These societies were decimated by Old-World diseases such as smallpox and were pushed west by warfare and encroaching European settlers. Their diminished numbers led to further marginalization, although today their cultures endure and continue to contribute to the American experience. </p>\n <p><b>European colonization</b> began in the 16th and 17th centuries. <span>England</span>, <span>Spain</span>, and <span>France</span> gained large holdings; the <span>Netherlands</span>, <span>Sweden</span>, and <span>Russia</span> also established outposts. The first English colonies, founded in <span>Jamestown</span>, <span>Virginia</span> (1607) and <span>Plymouth</span>, <span>Massachusetts</span> (1620), formed the kernel of what is now known as the United States. </p>\n <p>In the North, <span>Massachusetts</span> was settled by religious immigrants — <b>Puritans</b> — who later spread and founded most of the other <span>New England</span> colonies, creating a highly religious and idealistic region. Other religious groups also founded colonies, including the Quakers in <span>Pennsylvania</span> and Roman Catholics in <span>Maryland</span>. The Middle Colonies of <span>New York</span>, <span>New Jersey</span>, <span>Delaware</span> and <span>Pennsylvania</span> became the North's cosmopolitan center. </p>\n <p>Longer growing seasons in the Southern colonies, which remained dominated by Virginia, gave them richer agricultural prospects, especially for cotton and tobacco. As in <span>Latin America</span> and the <span>Caribbean</span>, indentured servants, convicts and later <b><span>African slaves</span></b> were imported and forced to cultivate large plantations. Slavery was practiced in both North and South, but its greater importance to the South's economy eventually caused tremendous upheaval. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/rBvo6TdyeeDRcKWPOejJaclOUFk1kP31yDkBgKhix_kQpMEqkas3eqk=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/IumWu51msQ4LW6efvO7Xp84jK2NO3VoKVbsKyY_sPLSoZl35Q7mjCLae51U=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Independence_hall_1_bs.jpg/250px-Independence_hall_1_bs.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Independence Hall in <span>Philadelphia</span> was where the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were drafted</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>By the early 18th century, <span>Great Britain</span> had colonized the Atlantic coast from <span>Georgia</span> north into what is now Canada. The last major British migration to the territory that would become the United States took place in middle decades of that century when the Appalachia region was settled. In 1763, British dominance in North America was established after the global Seven Years' War. In part to finance the North American campaigns of the war, known as the French and Indian War, Britain imposed unpopular taxes and regulations on its colonists. This precipitated revolution in 1775 and on 4 July 1776, colonists from 13 colonies declared independence. The <b>Revolutionary War</b> lasted until 1783, when the new United States of America gained sovereignty over all British land between the Atlantic and the <span>Mississippi River</span>. Those still loyal to the British mostly fled north to what is today <span>Canada</span>, which continued to remain under British rule. </p>\n <p>Wrangling over the formation of a national government lasted until 1787 when a constitution was agreed upon. Its Enlightenment-era ideas about individual liberty have since inspired the founding decrees of many states. <b>George Washington</b>, the general-in-chief of the revolutionary army, was elected the first president. By the turn of the 19th century, the newly-built <b><span>Washington, D.C.</span></b> was established as the national capital. </p>\n <p>New states were created as white settlers moved west beyond the Appalachian Mountains. The Native American populations were displaced and further harrowed by war and disease. The 1803 <b>Louisiana Purchase</b> of French lands to the west of the Mississippi (charted by the <span>Lewis and Clark expedition</span>) effectively doubled the size of the nation, and provided \"Indian Territory\" in what is now Oklahoma for the many Native American tribes from the east that were forcibly relocated during the <span>Trail of Tears</span> of the 1830s. </p>\n <p>Further disagreements with British commerce policies arising from the Napoleonic Wars and Royal Navy impressment led to the <b>War of 1812</b>. There were over two years of dramatic action on land and sea that included an attempted invasion of Canada and the burning of the White House and public buildings in Washington, D.C. The final stalemate saw virtually no changes of territory, but the war galvanized separate American and Canadian identities. The national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", was conceived during this war. Western Native American tribes that had sided with the British suffered greatly as their territory was given to white settlers. </p>\n <p>After the war, industry and infrastructure were expanded greatly, particularly in the Northeast; see <span>American Industry Tour</span>. Roads and canals came first and helped people spread inland. In 1825, the <span>Erie Canal</span> connected the Atlantic to the Great Lakes. By the late 1860s, railroads and telegraph lines connected the east and west coasts via the industrial hub of <span>Chicago</span> in the <span>Midwest</span>. In the early 19th century, a series of religious revivals, the Second Great Awakening, led to various reform movements that strove for goals such as temperance, the abolition of slavery, and women's suffrage. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/zbkowE3OaS9s2Yf0a8O4WxPHgovTMzJE7lya6kKVAAAu1Tw2uBP8rf4=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/34_8VPbt3hDzR8ikoNIco4VbX8tqhnqf2gdvdjrAxK8EFc-ftWz1HcgWtd0=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Alamo_San_Antonio_Texas_USA.jpg/250px-Alamo_San_Antonio_Texas_USA.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The 1836 Battle of the Alamo (<span>San Antonio</span>, <span>Texas</span>) was a crucial moment of the Texas Revolution.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>U.S. expansion south and west chipped away at Spanish and Mexican territory. Spain sold <span>Florida</span> in 1813 after American military intervention, and an 1836 rebellion by American settlers in Mexican Texas founded an independent republic which was absorbed into the Union ten years later. This sparked the <b>Mexican–American War</b> in which Mexico lost what is now <span>California</span>, <span>Nevada</span>, <span>Utah</span>, <span>Arizona</span>, and <span>New Mexico</span>, and the contiguous United States essentially assumed its modern outline. Native Americans were relegated to reservations and continued to be purged by treaty, military force, and disease from settlers on the <span>Oregon Trail</span> and other westward routes. (See also \"<span>Old West</span>\".) </p>\n <p>Federal governance was light and the states were highly autonomous. By the 1850s, there was irreconcilable disparity between the industrialized and more urban Northern states, which had all outlawed slavery within three decades of the revolution, and the plantation-dependent rural South. Many in the North wanted to impose a national ban on the expansion of slavery, while the Southern states sought to expand slavery into new territories. Abolitionists operated an <span>Underground Railroad</span> leading fugitive slaves in the northern states to freedom in <span>Canada</span>. In 1861, eleven Southern states, fearful of marginalization and the avowedly anti-slavery President <b>Abraham Lincoln</b>, broke from the Union and formed an independent Confederate States of America. The ensuing <b><span>American Civil War</span></b> remains the bloodiest conflict on American soil and killed hundreds of thousands of people. In 1865, Union forces prevailed, firmly cementing the federal government's authority over the states. Slavery was abolished nationwide and the Confederate states were re-admitted into the Union during a period of Reconstruction. The former slaves and their descendants were to remain an economic and social underclass, particularly in the South. </p>\n <p>Russia sold its tenuously held Alaskan territory in 1867, and independent Hawaii was annexed in 1898. The United States' decisive victory over Spain in the 1898 <b>Spanish–American War</b> gained it colonial territories: <span>Cuba</span> (granted independence a few years later), the <span>Philippines</span> (granted independence shortly after <span>World War II</span>), <span>Puerto Rico</span> and <span>Guam</span> (which remain American dependencies). The boundaries of the United States took the form we know today in 1959, when the territories of Alaska and Hawaii were granted statehood. </p>\n <p>In the late 19th and into the 20th century, Southern and Eastern Europeans, Russian Jews and Irish bolstered the continuing industrialization of the eastern cities by providing cheap labor. Many Southern African-Americans fled rural poverty and racism for industrial jobs in the North. Other immigrants, including many Scandinavians and Germans, moved to newly opened territories in the West and Midwest, where land was given to anyone who would develop it. </p>\n <p>The United States' entrance into <b><span>World War I</span></b> in 1917 marked the start of an era in which it would become a world power. However, soon after the victory the U.S. eschewed international involvement and refused to join the nascent League of Nations, effectively crippling the organization. Real wealth grew rapidly and in the Roaring 20s stock speculation created an immense financial \"bubble\". It burst in 1929, leading to the global economic havoc of the <b>Great Depression</b>. The resulting privation fostered a culture of sacrifice and hard work that would serve the country well in the coming conflict. It also ushered in President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His \"New Deal\" was a series of government programs that constructed thousands of buildings and bridges across the country while creating the basis of the American welfare state. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/D_PKo7enWeEK3NiZp5BMmY-1hBmLSA8Usn_W5XlqAZks7ntcb4GLYTI=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/JwBJcBRsdyaEbfWp63FYo-B3c59cQVwxMvChNY-ay2YjXkS2NtCxGFKnyAQ=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/USS_Arizona_Memorial.JPG/250px-USS_Arizona_Memorial.JPG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The USS Arizona Memorial at <span>Pearl Harbor</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>In 1941 Japan attacked <b>Pearl Harbor</b>, a Hawaiian naval base, plunging the United States into <b>World War II</b> on the side of the Allied Powers - see <span>World War II in Europe</span> and the <span>Pacific War</span>. The U.S. developed atomic bombs and dropped them twice on Japan in 1945, abruptly ending the war. By the end of the war, the United States had firmly established itself as the world's dominant economic power, responsible for nearly half of global industrial production. During the ensuing <b>Cold War</b>, the United States and the Soviet Union jostled for power while courting their own mutually assured destruction with nuclear weapons. Although war between the two superpowers never occurred, both sides were indirectly involved in covert operations and military endeavors through various proxy states that continue to (often negatively) affect the view people have of the United States and its role in global politics. </p>\n <p>For the century after the Civil War, black people, though ostensibly equal citizens under the post–Civil War amendments to the U.S. Constitution, suffered through strong social, economic, and political discrimination and state-sanctioned segregation, especially in the South. A movement fighting for full civil rights for black Americans gained strength following World War II, when returning black veterans who fought against racism abroad came home to find they were still heavily discriminated against. The <b>civil rights movement</b> vehemently, but largely peacefully, vied for equal rights. With <b>Martin Luther King, Jr.</b>, a charismatic preacher, as its most visible leader, the movement came to a head in 1963 when 200,000–300,000 people flooded the capital to listen to him. The landmark Civil Rights Act that was passed in 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, although such discrimination does still exist, mostly in less blatant forms. It would not be until the election of Barack Obama 44 years later in 2008 that the country would have its first African-American president. A revived women's movement in the 1960s also led to wide-ranging changes in American society. </p>\n <p>Postwar America was characterized by affluence and industrialization. People left agriculture and moved to the cities to become part of an increasingly technology-based economy. American car culture emerged in the 1950s and was supported by the construction of a comprehensive Interstate Highway System. These trends also led to the rise of suburbia and a decline in public transportation and rail travel, making touring the <span>United States without a car</span> particularly difficult to this day. They also resulted in <b>white flight</b> to the suburbs in many American cities, leaving many black people behind in blighted inner city neighborhoods. The American consumer culture, Hollywood movies and many forms of popular music established the United States as a cultural superpower in the world. The U.S. grew into one of the world's major centers of higher education, and is now home to many of the world's most prestigious universities, attracting more international students than any other country. </p>\n <p>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States has emerged as the world's sole superpower, and while its hegemony is increasingly being challenged by a resurgent <span>China</span> and <span>Russia</span>, it continues to play the dominant military, economic, political, and cultural role in world affairs. Hopes that after the fall of America's chief rival, expensive and sometimes disastrous wars (such as the Vietnam War) were a thing of the past sadly haven't proven true. Recent administrations have all had to deal in one form or other with what they call the threat of \"rogue states\", terrorism, and a rapidly changing global political landscape. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, are still very much an open wound and influence the political debate to this day, with heightened security measures at airports being just one way in which terrorism (or the fear of it) has affected travelers. Economically, the \"Great Recession\", triggered in 2007 by the collapse of the housing market bubble, came to an end in 2009, but the average American continues to feel the negative effects several years on. </p>\n <h3> <span>Government and politics</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The United States is a federal republic. Its major constituents are the 50 states and the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.); it also has various island territories in the Caribbean and Pacific that are strongly—but often not fully—integrated into the union. </p>\n <p>The federal government derives its power from the U.S. Constitution, which is the oldest written constitution in continuous use. Within the overarching federal laws, each state maintains its own constitution, government and laws, and so retains considerable autonomy within the federation. State laws can vary in their details but are, for the most part, fairly uniform from state to state. </p>\n <p>The <span>President</span> is elected every four years and is the head of the federal government and head of state. He and his administration form the executive branch. The bicameral Congress (comprising the lower House of Representatives and the upper Senate) is also popularly elected, and constitutes the legislative branch. The Supreme Court tops the judicial branch. State governments are organized similarly, with governors, legislatures, and judiciaries. </p>\n <p>Two major political parties have dominated at state and federal levels since the end of the Civil War: the Republican Party (often referred to as the GOP, short for \"Grand Old Party\") and the Democratic Party. Since the 1960s the Republican Party has become generally the more right-wing or \"conservative\" party whereas the Democratic Party is usually the more left-wing or \"liberal\" of the two parties. While smaller political parties exist, the winner-take-all electoral system means that they rarely succeed at any level. Although in much of the world red and blue indicate left- and right-leaning parties respectively, they are reversed in the U.S so that Republicans are red and Democrats are blue. </p>\n <h3> <span>Culture</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/XXasV3HWt9qSpEvSKHwYt0cVTT4Dkoyaav7lfhckOviYpzsJADJ1aRE=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/8KzJl7ptvCGpGgW5mSvL2mfeqchk_ybrjEKxwj2iwXPBkDDkOI_ZCEwUPw0=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Bourbon_Street_New_Orleans_Louisiana_USA.jpg/250px-Bourbon_Street_New_Orleans_Louisiana_USA.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The South's famous Bourbon Street, <span>New Orleans</span>, <span>Louisiana</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The United States is made up of many diverse ethnic groups and the culture varies greatly across the vast area of the country and even within cities – a city like New York will have dozens, if not hundreds, of different ethnicities represented within a neighborhood. Despite this difference, there exists a strong sense of national identity and certain predominant cultural traits. Generally, Americans tend to believe strongly in personal freedom and responsibility, and that an individual determines his or her own success or failure, but there are many exceptions. You will find Mississippi in the South to be very different culturally from Massachusetts in the North. </p>\n <p>Religion is very important in the United States with 80% of people identifying with having a religious affiliation. Current estimates are that 49% of Americans belong to a Christian Protestant church and another 23% are Roman Catholic. 5% of Americans belong to non-Christian religions such as Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism. Many businesses and institutions are closed on Sundays, and a number of areas in the South and Midwest forbid certain activities to take place on Sundays, while some Jewish businesses close on Friday nights and Saturdays for the Sabbath. </p>\n <p>Although officially a secular state, the United States is in practice more religious than other Western countries such as <span>Australia</span>, <span>Canada</span> and most <span>European</span> countries. However, this trend varies greatly by region, with the West Coast and Northeast being largely secular and the <span>American South</span> being heavily Evangelical Christian. Differences in religiosity often correlate with politics, so the Northeast, West Coast, Hawaii and Chicago metropolitan area are generally progressive and Democratic; most of the South and heavily Mormon states like Utah, Idaho and Wyoming are very conservative and Republican; and much of the rest of the country (e.g., several Midwestern, Southwestern/Rocky Mountain, and Southern coastal states) is nearly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. However, even this can be misleading, as many conservative states have college towns and major cities that are very liberal, while liberal states often have rural areas that are very conservative. A trend of the last few decades is one of increasing geographic political polarization. Most Americans now live in counties where their political inclination has a majority of 20% or greater and cities are - on the whole - becoming more and more liberal while rural areas are becoming more and more conservative with the middle ground disappearing. </p>\n <h3> <span>Holidays</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=1><tbody><tr><td> <p><b>Always gotta be different</b></p>\n <p>Whereas most countries celebrate Labor Day on May 1 to commemorate the Haymarket affair of 1886, the U.S. chose to celebrate it in September, due to fear that a May celebration would encourage similar Haymarket-style protests and energize the radical left. </p>\n <p>November 11, which is Remembrance Day in Europe and Canada, has been expanded to celebrate all veterans of the U.S. armed forces; Memorial Day serves the purpose of recognizing war dead. </p>\n </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>There are no nationwide, mandatory public holidays. Federal holidays are the most centrally coordinated holidays, but they are only mandatory for the federal government and banks. All federal government offices, post offices and banks close on federal holidays, but private businesses may freely choose whether or not to observe them. </p>\n <p>Nearly all states and localities observe the federal holidays; most also observe an additional handful of their own. If a federal holiday falls on a weekend, the observance will be shifted to the <b>nearest weekday</b> (either Friday or Monday), with closures similar to Presidents Day in February. The festivities and major retail closings will occur on the annual date, even if it's the weekend. </p>\n <p>The time between Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday in November) and January 1 has such a high concentration of major holidays that it is often simply called \"the holiday season.\" School and work vacations are commonly taken during this period, with people visiting family and friends. Airports, Interstates, bus stations, and train stations will be very crowded near the major holidays. If you must travel, allow extra time to check in and clear security. This is also a major gift-giving season: most shopping malls and department stores will be crowded, especially on the day after Thanksgiving, the week before Christmas, and the day after Christmas. </p>\n <p>As in most other countries where alcohol is legal, be careful on the roads at and around major holidays, such as New Year's, Memorial Day, or Independence Day, as there are higher concentrations of drunk drivers on the roads then. </p>\n <p>In the list below, federal holidays are listed in <i><b>bold italics</b></i>.

Instead it uses \"customary units\" (feet, miles, gallons, pounds, etc.), which are largely derived from the English units of the 18th century, and are sometimes different from the imperial units that occasionally linger in Britain. Road distances are given in miles and speed limits in miles per hour (1 mile is 1.61 km, or 1 km is 0.62 miles). One of the more confusing things is that an \"ounce\" can be either a measure of weight or (as a \"fluid ounce\") a measure of volume. The U.S. <i>fluid ounce</i> is also slightly larger than its imperial counterpart, while U.S. gallons, quarts and pints are smaller than their counterparts. Gasoline and other liquids are usually sold per gallon, quart, or fluid ounce (a U.S. gallon is 3.78 liters, so a U.S. quart [a <i>quart</i>er gallon] is slightly less than a liter). Beverages such as soda are sometimes sold by the liter and other times sold by the fluid ounce, with just under 34 ounces to a liter. Temperatures are usually reported in Fahrenheit only; 32° is actually freezing, not warm! Most cars' speedometers show both miles and kilometers per hour (good for trips to Canada and Mexico), and almost all packaged foods and other products are labeled in both systems. Outside of science, medicine and the military, there is little day-to-day exposure to the metric system, so Americans will assume you understand the U.S. customary measures. </p>\n <p>There is no formal regulation of clothes or shoe sizes, and the only thing you can count on is that sizes tend to be consistent within the same brand. For shoe sizes some trial and error will be needed for <i>each model</i>. </p>\n <h3> <span>Time zones</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/YP99tzBqf5D1C3vbKiseO_n71YBUkWjv4fSZfiroUtcAtYAVal4Jz7E=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/sjRWTGFrbcEF4gPEDgnMlAImFfkrkjUJ8EYjzLD-pjckKli9wV4TkNWe2h0=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/US-Timezones.svg/350px-US-Timezones.svg.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Time zones of the U.S. as of 2007; nowadays, some Indiana counties have moved to Eastern time</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Taking into consideration even the small territories in the Pacific Ocean (some of which cannot be easily accessed) the U.S. spans eleven <span>time zones</span>.

Here are a few: </p>\n <p>See the article <span>English language varieties</span> for more words that differ across both versions. </p>\n </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Almost all Americans speak <b>English</b>. Most Americans speak in accents that are recognizably similar to one another and to one traditionally associated with the Midwest, which was popularized in the 20th century by American radio, TV and movies. Although many Americans can discern differences between quite a few accents, the ones most likely to be heard as distinctive by foreign visitors include those commonly spoken in the South and Texas, the Boston area, the New York City area, the upper Midwest and Hawaii. </p>\n <p>American English differs somewhat from the English spoken in other parts of the English speaking world. These differences are mostly minor, and primarily around minor spelling and pronunciation differences. One important difference, though, is that dates are always written MM/DD/YYYY or MM/DD. See the article on <span>English language varieties</span> for a detailed discussion. </p>\n <p>Many African-Americans and some other Americans also speak African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), which has somewhat different grammar and vocabulary from styles of American English usually regarded as standard. Nearly all African-Americans can switch back and forth between AAVE and standard American English effortlessly. Generally, if you are not African-American, you should not try to speak AAVE, even if it's spoken to you; it would be considered odd and possibly offensive. Spanglish — an admixture of Spanish and English — is similarly commonplace in many areas with large Hispanic populations, and code-switching between Spanglish and standard American English is similarly commonplace. </p>\n <p>Visitors are generally <b>expected to speak and understand English</b>. While many Americans study a foreign language in school (overwhelmingly Spanish followed by French), few progress past the basics. Popular tourist sites often have signs and information available in other languages. Americans have a long history of immigration and are very accommodating towards foreign accents, and will sometimes take the effort to help you by speaking in a more standard accent. </p>\n <p><b><span>Spanish</span></b> is the first language of Puerto Rico and a large minority of residents on the mainland (with the fifth-largest Spanish speaking population in the world). Spanish speakers in the United States are often Puerto Ricans or first- and second-generation immigrants from Latin America. As a result, the Spanish spoken is almost invariably a Latin American dialect. Spanish is the primary second language in many parts of the United States such as California, the Southwest, Texas, Florida, and the metropolitan areas of Chicago and New York City. Many of these areas have Spanish-language radio and television stations, with local, national and Mexican programs. Most publications from the federal government, and those of some state and municipal governments are available in Spanish. Many establishments and government offices in major commercial and tourist areas have Spanish-speaking staff on duty, and it is possible with some difficulty to get by in the major cities and main tourist attractions speaking only Spanish. </p>\n <p>You may encounter other languages in some regions, like Hawaiian, French, American Indian languages, Yiddish, and Pennsylvania Dutch. These are covered in regional articles. </p>\n <p><b>American Sign Language</b> (<b>ASL</b>) is the dominant sign language in the United States. When events are interpreted, they will be interpreted in ASL. Users of French Sign Language and other related languages may find ASL intelligible, as they share much vocabulary, but users of Japanese Sign Language, British Sign Language, or Auslan will not. Closed-captioning on television is widespread, but far from ubiquitous.

You cannot be coming to the U.S. for formal education, to get a job, or to conduct journalism; if you are, you must get an appropriate visa in advance no matter how short your trip to the U.S. may be. </p>\n <p>The 90-day limit is not extendable. A short trip to Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean will not allow a fresh 90 days upon return to the U.S. An extended absence to the neighboring countries may reset the limit, particularly if your first trip to the U.S. was short. Take care if transiting through the U.S. on a trip around North America that exceeds 90 days. </p>\n <p>Having a criminal record, having been refused entry, or having been denied a U.S. visa will make you ineligible to enter on the VWP; you will have to apply for a U.S. visa instead. </p>\n <p>Entry under the VWP by air or sea requires the completion of an online form and a payment of $14, preferably 72 hours before arrival. The form is called the <b><a rel=nofollow href=https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/ target=_blank>Electronic System for Travel Authorization</a></b> (ESTA). ESTA approval covers multiple trips and is valid for two years (unless your passport expires earlier). This requirement is waived if entering by land. </p>\n <p><b>All passports</b> must be biometric. If your passport is an older one that was issued before biometric passports were available, you will need to obtain a new passport to travel to the U.S. on the VWP. </p>\n <p>Entry under the VWP by air or sea requires travel with a signatory carrier. Any commercial scheduled services to the U.S. will be fine, but if you are on a chartered flight or vessel you should check the status of the carrier, as you may require a visa. Flying your own personal aircraft, or sailing your own personal yacht to the U.S. will require you to obtain a tourist visa in advance. </p>\n <p>Travellers entering by air or sea should also have a return or onward ticket out of the United States. This requirement is not necessary for residents of Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, or the Caribbean. </p>\n <p>Entry under the VWP does not allow you to change your immigration status, and if you are denied entry, the decision can't be appealed and you will immediately be placed on the first flight out. </p>\n <h4> <span>Obtaining a visa</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=1><tbody><tr><td> <p><b>U.S. Visa/Residence Status Overview</b></p>\n <p><br>\n</p>\n </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>For the rest of the world, the visa application fee is a non-refundable <b>$160</b> (as of October 2018) for visas that are not issued on the basis of a petition and $190 for those that are; this fee is waived under very limited circumstances, namely for people requesting certain exchange visitor visas. </p>\n <p>Depending on your nationality and the category of visa you are requesting, you may need to pay an additional fee (ranging from $7–200) only if the visa is issued. This is called a <i>reciprocity fee</i> and is charged by the U.S. to match the fees charged by other countries on U.S. citizens. </p>\n <p>Additionally, Chinese (PRC) citizens (that is, anyone travelling to the US on a PRC passport) <b>must enroll</b> in the <b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.evus.gov/evus/#/ target=_blank>Electronic Visa Update System</a></b> (EVUS) for travel into the United States on any 10-year B-type visa. The enrollment is valid for two years (or until passport/visa expiry, whichever comes first) before it needs to be updated again. </p>\n <p>The Immigration and Nationality Act states that all persons requesting entry into the U.S. as non-immigrants are presumed to be immigrants until they overcome that presumption by showing evidence of \"binding ties\" to their home country, and sufficient proof that the visit will be temporary. Applicants also need to demonstrate that they are genuinely entitled to the visa they are applying for. Face-to-face interviews at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate are required for almost all nationalities, and waits for interview slots and visa processing can add up to several months. </p>\n <p>Embassies are closed on U.S. holidays <i>and</i> on holidays of the host country, so you need to know both holidays when setting dates to apply for a visa. You should start planning your trip far in advance, as the application process is known to take up to six months. </p>\n <p><i>Do not assume anything.</i> Check on documentation requirements with the <a rel=nofollow href=http://travel.state.gov/ target=_blank>U.S. State Department</a> or with the nearest U.S. consulate. </p>\n <p>Your visa is generally not tied to your permitted length of stay; for example, a 10-year visa does not allow a stay of 10 years. On the other hand, you can enter the country on the last day of validity of your visa and still be allowed to stay, for example, up to 180 days as a tourist. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/mqJ0ZPQIefi8ep6OjHJv3_hXHEIsj9zjcZGzizG2W8aGW9g6H__5BRM=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/om9XT0rScgT8IN6C4CQ7gnaryuLp1oDMIjujm-dEiwLQ3evBV23LwT0VNcs=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Statueofliberty_nps.jpg/250px-Statueofliberty_nps.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Statue of Liberty, <span>New York City</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <h4> <span>Travel to U.S. possessions</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>America's overseas possessions have slightly different rules.

If you are unable to convince immigration officers that you intend to abide by the terms of your visa, you will be refused entry and deported. </p>\n <p>Once they decide to let you in, you are <b>fingerprinted</b> and a <b>digital photograph</b> is taken. Entry will be denied if either of these procedures is refused. </p>\n <p>At selected airports, Canadian and VWP nationals may be able to use automated passport control (APC) kiosks to record their passport and biometric details. Household members traveling together can do this at once. VWP nationals need to have ESTA clearance, and have entered the U.S. at least once since 2008. If successful, the traveller gets a receipt and goes to the designated CBP desk to continue the inspection process. Canadians and other selected nationals may be eligible to participate in various trusted traveler programs such as <span>Global Entry</span> and <span>NEXUS</span>, which allow pre-approved passengers to use a designated kiosk for the inspection process. Unlike APC, these programs require prior application, background checks, an interview, and an application fee, but allows the passenger to bypass intense questioning and skip the lines at immigration for up to 5 years. </p>\n <p>Because <b>marijuana</b> is illegal under federal law, if you have consumed marijuana or invested in the marijuana industry, you can be banned from entering the United States. This is true even if marijuana is legal in your country and even if it's also legal in the state you're trying to enter. Border officials don't usually ask about marijuana, but if they see a reason to ask, they might. Even a single copy of \"High Times\" magazine or anything similar is enough to draw suspicion. If you admit to having used marijuana (or any other drug illegal under U.S. federal law) or invested in the industry, or if you are caught lying about it, you can be turned back and <b>banned for life</b> from entering the country. To appeal the ban, you have to apply for a $585 waiver. </p>\n <h4> <span>Customs</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>Each household (i.e. family members living and traveling together) needs to complete one customs declaration form. Travellers eligible for APC, as well as Global Entry and NEXUS members, can do this electronically using the respective kiosks and need not fill up the paper form. Those eligible for <a rel=nofollow href=https://mobilepassport.us/ target=_blank>Mobile Passport Control</a> (U.S. citizens and some Canadian citizens) also do not need to fill out the form, provided they have completed the app's questions and have a QR code ready to go.

An exception to this rule is cigars and alcoholic beverages (mainly rum) originating from Cuba. With the ongoing thaw in <span>U.S.–Cuban relations</span>, the U.S. has lifted sanctions against importation of these items for personal use (limits are the same as for tobacco and alcohol originating elsewhere). </p>\n <p>The United States has very strict biosecurity laws, and imposes restrictions on the types of food that may be brought into the country. In general, fresh food may not be brought into the country, though some types of processed, commercially packaged food may be allowed, depending on the country of origin. Check with the <b><a rel=nofollow href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/sa_international/sa_travel?1dmy&urile=wcm%3apath%3a%2Faphis_content_library%2Fsa_resources%2Fsa_traveler%2Fct_general_allowed_food_items\" target=_blank>United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)</a></b> for more details. <b>All</b> food and plant items being brought into the country must declared and inspected by customs, even if permitted. Failure to declare agricultural products can result in a fine, or in serious cases even prosecution. </p>\n <p>Besides your personal effects, which will go home with you, you are allowed to import individual gifts with a value of $100 or less per item. If you're 21 years of age or older, you may also import limited quantities of <b>tobacco</b> and <b>alcohol</b> products duty-free: </p>\n <p>If you are over the alcohol exemption by a small amount (e.g. a six pack of beer or a second bottle of wine) most customs officers will let this slide for wine and beer <i>if you've made a full and accurate declaration</i>. Anything more than this, or any hard spirits over the limit will likely result in duty and tax being assessed, the amount of which depends in part on the state you're entering to and the country the goods are from. (Duty from Canada, for example, is minimal owing in part to NAFTA.) <b>Customs officers do not show this leniency with tobacco products</b>; expect to pay if you are even one cigarette over! </p>\n <p>A reasonable quantity of <b>perfume</b> or <b>cologne</b> can also be imported provided the brand is not under a \"Trademark Restriction in the United States\". There is no restriction on the amount of <b>money</b> you can bring into or out of the U.S. However, if you are travelling with $10,000 or more (or its equivalent in foreign currency) per household, you must declare it on your customs form and you will be given a special form to fill out; not declaring exposes you to a fine and possible seizure of that cash. Checks, bonds and other financial instruments must also be declared. ATM/Debit cards linked to non-U.S. bank accounts carrying the said amount do not need to be declared (although your bank may impose some withdrawal restrictions and fees to access this money in the U.S.). </p>\n <p>The U.S. possessions of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands are outside the federal customs jurisdiction and each have their own separate requirements. Travel between these regions and the rest of the U.S. requires a customs check. There are some differences (mostly larger) in duty exemptions for U.S. citizens returning from these destinations. </p>\n <h4> <span>Leaving the United States</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <div><table><tbody><tr> <td><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/VKUR6u86M4GwUT6PlA-2FrQ3L0klarqZYYFEJnz2dwNq3wZ1ly__2vs=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/sMMQ_SdgvHFTtnPY6TIgkvoYvlKrCRrVHE0j4cb6wlCzR-biglgPHowxEM4=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Exclamationdiamond_blue.svg/40px-Exclamationdiamond_blue.svg.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></td> <td> <span><b>Thinking of Overstaying?:</b></span> Overstaying the period granted at passport control or violating your terms of entry (e.g. work on a B1/B2 status) <b>will automatically invalidate your visa.</b> It will also make it extremely difficult to re-enter the United States and may also bar you from re-entry for at least three years, if not permanently.

If you are transferring to a domestic flight, you will need to go through customs and immigration at your first U.S. stop; make sure you allow ample time to make any transfers. </p>\n <p>Most airports have near the exit a wall of \"courtesy phones\" with the description and the prices of motels in the area. You can call these motels free of charge and ask for a room and a pick up shuttle will come to fetch you at the airport.

Allow plenty of time (at least 15 minutes, sometimes more than 1 hour) and pack as lightly as possible. Security is handled by the <b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.tsa.gov/ target=_blank>Transportation Security Administration</a></b> (<b>TSA</b>), although details can vary slightly at each airport. Adults must show <b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification target=_blank>approved picture ID</a></b> (a passport is sufficient). </p>\n <p>When connecting from an international flight, <i>all</i> passengers must go through security screening to continue on the onward flight, after clearing immigration and customs inspections. That means all liquids and prohibited items (<a rel=nofollow href=http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/prohibited-items target=_blank>per TSA rules</a>) that were purchased in a Duty Free shop or allowed through as carry on from a foreign airport must re-packed into checked luggage after coming out of the customs area and before re-checking luggage. In most airports there is a check-in desk outside or conveyor belt outside of customs for transiting passengers to re-check their luggage. Items cannot be re-packed or re-arranged before customs inspections in the luggage reclaim area. </p>\n <p>There are limitations on <b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/liquids-rule target=_blank>liquids</a></b> (including gels, aerosols, creams, and pastes) in carry-on baggage. Ensure that any liquids are held in containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces (100 mL). The containers must all be placed within a single zippered plastic bag that is 1 quart (946 mL) or less in size. Only one such bag, with however much liquid, is allowed per passenger. Medications (including saline solution for contact lenses) and infant and child nourishment are exempt but subject to additional testing; notify TSA agents if you are carrying these items, store them separately from your other liquids, and if possible clearly label them in advance. </p>\n <p>If you wish to lock your checked baggage, the TSA requires you to use special locks that have the Travel Sentry TSA lock system. These locks can be opened by TSA officials using a master key should they wish to inspect the contents of your bag. If your lock is not one of the TSA-approved locks, the TSA will break it open and you will not be entitled to any compensation for the damage. </p>\n <h4> <span>Pre-clearance</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <dl><dt>From Canada</dt></dl> <p>Passengers whose journeys begin in major Canadian airports and involve either U.S. or Canadian carriers will <i>usually</i> be able to clear U.S. entry formalities (passport control and customs) at their Canadian port of exit. These flights are treated the same as U.S. domestic flights, and most Canadian carriers are located in U.S. domestic terminals or concourses in most airports. Some airports (such as LaGuardia Airport in New York City) that don't have customs and immigration facilities receive pre-cleared flights from Canada. </p>\n <p>Travellers on U.S.–Canadian flights operated by foreign carriers like Philippine Airlines and Cathay Pacific, and those from minor Canadian airports that do not have preclearance facilities, will still encounter traditional entry formalities upon arrival at their first U.S. stop; a Canadian transit visa may be required even if passengers are confined to a holding area for the entire transit time. </p>\n <p>Some airports in Canada, including <span>Vancouver</span> International Airport, Terminal 1 of <span>Toronto</span>-Pearson Airport, and <span>Montréal</span>-Trudeau Airport generally do not require passengers in transit from abroad to pass through Canadian Customs and Immigration controls before going through U.S. preclearance formalities. However, even if you pass through these airports, make sure that your papers are in order to allow you to enter Canada: if you cannot travel to the U.S. on the same day you go through preclearance, if you are not cleared for entry to the United States, <i>or</i> if you and/or your luggage is not checked through by your airline to at least your first destination in the United States, you must report to Canada Customs; a Canadian transit or temporary resident visa may be required.

Coast-to-coast travel takes about 6 hours from east to west, and 5 hours from west to east (varying due to winds), compared to the days necessary for land transportation. Most large cities in the U.S. are served by one or two airports; many smaller towns also have some passenger air service, although you may need to detour through a major hub airport to get there. Depending on where you are starting, it may be cheaper to drive to a nearby large city and fly or, conversely, to fly to a large city near your destination and rent a car. </p>\n <p>The largest airlines are the three remaining mainline legacy carriers (<b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.aa.com target=_blank>American Airlines</a></b>, <b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.delta.com target=_blank>Delta</a></b>, and <b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.united.com target=_blank>United</a></b>) and two of the country's low-cost carriers, <b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.southwest.com target=_blank>Southwest</a></b> and <b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.jetblue.com target=_blank>JetBlue</a></b>. <b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.alaskaair.com target=_blank>Alaska Airlines</a></b> and <b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.hawaiianairlines.com target=_blank>Hawaiian Airlines</a></b> are legacy regional carriers, while smaller airlines <b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.spirit.com target=_blank>Spirit</a></b>, <b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.flyfrontier.com target=_blank>Frontier</a></b>, <b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.allegiant.com target=_blank>Allegiant</a></b> and <b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.suncountry.com target=_blank>Sun Country</a></b> are trying to make inroads. There are also smaller regional airlines that are subsidiaries of the mainline carriers and can be booked through their parents. </p>\n <p>Major carriers compete for business on major routes, and travellers willing to book two or more weeks in advance can get bargains. However most smaller destinations are served by only one or two regional carriers, and prices there can be expensive. The difference in fees and service between low-cost and mainline carriers is, however, virtually nonexistent these days. Low-cost carriers occasionally offer more amenities than mainline carriers, such as inflight entertainment for even a short-haul flight, or free checked baggage in the price of their tickets. Southwest Airlines, for instance, allows passengers to check in up to two pieces of bags in their base price. </p>\n <h4> <span>Security</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <dl><dd><i>See <span>§ Security</span> under <span>§ Get in - By plane</span></i></dd></dl> <h4> <span>By private plane</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <dl><dd><i>See also: <span>General aviation</span></i></dd></dl> <p>The cost of chartering the smallest private jet begins at around $4000 per flight hour, with the cost substantially higher for larger, longer-range aircraft, and cheaper for smaller propeller planes. While private flying is by no means inexpensive, a family of four or more can often fly together at a cost similar to or even favorable to buying first-class commercial airline tickets, especially to smaller airports where scheduled commercial flights are at their most expensive, and private flying is at its cheapest. Though you may find it cheaper than flying a family of four first-class internationally, it is rarely the case, except when traveling from Western Europe. General aviation is the most practical way to reach the outer boroughs of <span>Alaska</span>. </p>\n <p><b>Air charter</b> refers to hiring a private plane for a one-time journey. <b>Jet Cards</b> are pre-paid cards entitling the owner to a specific number of flight hours on a specified aircraft. As all expenses are pre-paid on the card, you need not concern yourself with deadhead time, return flights, landing fees, etc. </p>\n <p>Many small-town airports on America's borders welcome individually-owned small aircraft.

While the United States still has the world's longest rail network, it is primarily used for freight transport these days. Except for certain corridors (mostly in the Northeast where a second cousin of <span>high speed rail</span> is available), passenger trains in the United States can be surprisingly scarce, slow, unreliable, and expensive. The national rail system, <b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.amtrak.com target=_blank>Amtrak</a></b><abbr title=phone>☏</abbr><bdi><span><span>+1-800-USA-RAIL (872-7245)</span></span></bdi>, provides service to many cities, offering exceptional sightseeing opportunities, but not particularly efficient inter-city travel, and is often more expensive than a flight. In more urban locations, Amtrak can be very efficient and comfortable, but in rural areas delays are common. Plan ahead to ensure train travel between your destinations is available and/or convenient. They have promotional discounts of 15% for students and seniors, and a 30-day U.S. Rail Pass for international travellers only. If you plan to buy a regular ticket within a week of travelling, it pays to check the website for sometimes significant \"weekly specials\". There is no dedicated <span>high-speed rail</span> network in the United States, and driving yourself will often be quicker than taking the train when travelling long distances. </p>\n <p>Amtrak offers many amenities and services that are lacking from other modes of transport. Amtrak's routes traverse some of America's most beautiful areas. Travellers with limited time may not find travel by train to be convenient, simply because the country is <i>big</i>, and that \"bigness\" is particularly evident in many of the scenic areas. For those with ample time, though, train travel offers an unparalleled view of the U.S.. Some of the most scenic routes include the <i><span>California Zephyr</span></i> that runs between <span>Emeryville</span> in the <span>Bay Area</span> of California to Chicago and the <i>Empire Builder</i> that goes from Chicago to Seattle or Portland. Both offer a lounge car with floor-to-ceiling windows and double decker cars. </p>\n <p>During usual American vacation times, some long-distance trains (outside the Northeast) can sell out weeks or even months in advance. Booking early also results in generally lower fares for all trains. Same-day reservations are usually easy, and depending on the rules of the fare you purchased, you can change travel plans on the day itself without fees. </p>\n <p>Separate from Amtrak, many major cities offer very reliable <b>commuter trains</b> that carry passengers to and from the suburbs or other relatively close-by areas. Some commuter train stations have park and ride facilities where you can park your car to use the commuter train to get to a city's downtown core where traffic and parking problems complicate car use. Parking rates at the stations vary (some facilities may be operated by third parties). Some commuter train systems and services do not operate on weekends and holidays, and even those that do often have greatly reduced frequencies, so it's best to check the system's website to plan ahead. Buy tickets <b>before</b> you board the train as you will either face a substantially more expensive fare or a hefty fine. </p>\n <h3> <span>By boat</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>America has the largest system of <b>inland waterways</b> of any country in the world. It is entirely possible to navigate around within the United States by boat. Your choices of watercraft range from self-propelled canoes and kayaks to elaborate houseboats and riverboat cruises. </p>\n <p>Rivers and canals were key to developing the country, and traversing by boat gives you a unique perspective on the nation and some one of a kind scenery. Some examples of waterways open to recreational boating and/or scheduled cruises are: </p>\n <p>Each year, many beginning boaters successfully navigate these waterways. Any kind of boating requires some preparation and planning. In general, the Coast Guard, Canal and Seaway authorities go out of their way to help recreational boaters. They will also at times give instructions which you are expected to obey immediately. For example, small craft may be asked to give way to larger craft on canals, and weather conditions may require you to stop or change your route. </p>\n <p>Regular <span>ferries</span> exist to a variety of destinations on the coast. In the northwest of the country, you can travel with the ferries of the <span>Alaska Marine Highway System</span> from <span>Bellingham (Washington)</span> all the way along Alaska's southern coast to <span>Dutch Harbor-Unalaska</span>. As a bonus you get to enjoy beautiful mountain and archipelago scenery. Moreover, much of off-the-beaten-path-Alaska is just accessible by boat. There is no commercial passenger service between the continental U.S. and <span>Hawaii</span>. </p>\n <h3> <span>By car</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <dl><dd><i>See also: <span>Driving in the United States</span></i></dd></dl> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/4qal0hlFglv-XMKareuKG9VbmgTlYEjAWfI2PnXL8vlLRB76uNzzeIs=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/ALWrl_FAvhWF1M5Te4qWJl1qcBijDANgrVS7BUhiBzz-i7YGVOsiP3FI1fM=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/High_Five.jpg/180px-High_Five.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The \"High Five\" five-Level interchange in <span>Dallas</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>America's love affair with the automobile is legendary, so travelling the <span>United States without a car</span> can be difficult. Most American cities have developed with automobiles in mind, so renting or bringing your own car is usually a very good idea. There are only a few major cities where using public transportation is preferable to driving: New York City, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, and Washington. Other very large cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Miami have limited public transport options, and the options only get worse in smaller cities. Taxis and ride-hailing services are often available, but they can get expensive and taxis (especially) can be hard to find outside of airports. While most Americans are happy to give driving directions, don't be surprised if many aren't familiar with the local public transport options available. </p>\n <p>Traffic signs do not conform to international standards but, if you understand English, they should be self-explanatory. </p>\n <p>The national road system consists of </p>\n <p>Be careful with road signs, as any of these can morph into state routes, interstates, or highways with little warning other than size and signs. </p>\n <p>All of them are generally well maintained by the respective states, but while the main Interstate system generally links only the major towns of every state (hence the name: <i>Interstate</i>), the U.S. highway and state routes can lead you to many interesting off-the-beaten-path sights, if you don't mind stopping at traffic lights and dealing with pedestrians. Most sections of the roads are free to use, but there are some which levy fees. </p>\n <h4> <span>Great American Road Trip</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/WR2K6ivs3-XEMeQ1k-w3UlbFCqQGxQ6jK2YC5jgenpIhsmaN8hCbxDs=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/Edg0KhfAx_z_u8lUo1fsQoasaOYDGVghmxbS52kMdsRui21Lp5jI9SRfxFE=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Amboy_%28California%2C_USA%29%2C_Hist._Route_66_--_2012_--_1.jpg/220px-Amboy_%28California%2C_USA%29%2C_Hist._Route_66_--_2012_--_1.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>Route 66</span>, a highway connecting Los Angeles with Chicago. Essentially the main route for the Great American Road trip. It also invokes nostalgia in the southwestern states.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>A romantic appeal is attached to the idea of <b>long-distance car travel</b>; many Americans will tell you that you can't see the \"real\" America except by car. Given the scarcity of public transportation in most American cities, the loss of time travelling <i>between</i> cities by car rather than flying can be made up by the convenience of driving around <i>within</i> cities once you arrive. In addition, many of the country's major <b>natural attractions</b>, such as the <span>Grand Canyon</span>, are almost impossible to get to without an automobile or on a bus tour. If you have the time, a classic American road trip with a rented car is very easy to achieve. (You may have to shop around a bit for a one-way rental. Pay attention to how many miles they allow you to put on the vehicle, since you probably want to make detours for sightseeing.) Because of the distances, this kind of travel can mean many long days behind the wheel, so pay attention to the comfort of the car you use. A \"coast-to-coast\" trip with more than one driver and few stops will take at least 5 days (41⁄2 if you have strong bladders). </p>\n <h4> <span>Driving laws</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>Driving law is primarily a matter of state law and is enforced by state and local police. While there are some minor variations state-to-state, the rules of the road are fairly consistent across the country. All states publish an official driver's handbook which summarizes state driving laws in plain English, with some states providing a Spanish version as well. These handbooks are usually available both on the Web and at many government offices. <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.aaa.com target=_blank>AAA</a> publishes a AAA/CAA Digest of Motor Laws, which is now <a rel=nofollow href=http://drivinglaws.aaa.com/ target=_blank>available online</a> for free that covers especially a few difference of traffic rules applied by all U.S. states and Canadian provinces. </p>\n <p>Foreign visitors age 18 and older can usually drive on their foreign driver's license for up to a year, depending on state law. Licenses that are not in English must be accompanied by an International Driving Permit (IDP) or a certified translation. Persons who stay in the United States for more than a year must obtain a driver's license from the state they are residing in, though exceptions might apply depending on the state they are in (e.g. some states waive this requirement for those on student visas).

However, downtown surface streets and big-city expressways often become crowded with a lot of \"hurried\" drivers, who will exceed speed limits, make unsafe lane changes, or follow other cars at unsafe close distances (\"tailgating\"). Speed limits are variable depending on the area in which you are driving; enforcement is unpredictable and varies widely from state to state. Keeping pace with other drivers will usually avoid trouble. Beware of small towns along otherwise high-speed rural roads (and medium-speed suburban roads); the lower speed limits within these towns are strictly enforced. </p>\n <h3> <span>By bus</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <dl><dd><i>See also: <span>Long-distance bus travel in the United States</span></i></dd></dl> <p>Intercity bus travel is widespread, but not available everywhere.

Greyhound buses typically run in 5-7 hour segments, at which time all passengers must get off the bus so it can be serviced, even if it's the middle of the night. Continuing passengers are boarded before those just getting on.

In general in the U.S., local buses don't stop at every stop. In some cities they'll stop if they see someone waiting at the bus stop, but in others you may have to give a little wave to let them know you want to get on.

Some RVers love the convenience of being able to drive their home anywhere they like and enjoy the camaraderie that RV campgrounds offer. Other people dislike the hassles and maintenance issues that come with RVing. And don't even think about driving an RV into a huge metropolis such as New York. Still, if you want to drive extensively within the United States and are comfortable handling a big rig, renting an RV is an option you should consider. </p>\n <h3> <span>By motorcycle</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The thrill and exhilaration of cross country travel are magnified when you go by motorcycle. <b>Harley-Davidson</b> is the preeminent American motorcycle brand and Harley operates a <a rel=nofollow href=\"http://www.harley-davidson.com/en_US/Content/Pages/Try_a_Bike/rent-a-bike.html?locale=en_US\" target=_blank>motorcycle rental program</a> for those licensed and capable of handling a full weight motorcycle. In some parts of the country, you can also rent other types of motorcycles, such as sportbikes, touring bikes, and dual-sport bikes. For those inexperienced with motorcycles, Harley and other dealerships offer classes for beginners. Wearing a helmet, although not required in all states, is always a good idea. The practice of riding between lanes of slower cars, also known as \"lane-sharing\" or \"lane-splitting,\" is illegal, except in California where it is tolerated and widespread. Solo motorcyclists can legally use \"high-occupancy vehicle\" or \"carpool\" lanes during their hours of operation. </p>\n <p>American enthusiasm towards motorcycles has led to a motorcycling subculture. <b>Motorcycle clubs</b> are exclusive clubs for members dedicated to riding a particular brand of motorcycle within a highly structured club hierarchy. <b>Riding clubs</b> may or may not be organized around a specific brand of bikes and offer open membership to anyone interested in riding. Motorcycle rallies, such as the famous one in <span>Sturgis</span>, South Dakota, are huge gatherings of motorcyclists from around the country. Many motorcyclists are not affiliated with any club and opt to ride independently or with friends. In general, motorcycling is seen as a hobby, as opposed to a practical means of transportation; this means, for example, that most American motorcyclists prefer not to ride in inclement weather. However you choose to ride, and whatever brand of bike you prefer, motorcycling can be a thrilling way to see the country. </p>\n <h3> <span>By thumb</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/rApG5gErzhRfiBNq-wJJ5eFIJ2nfTxz7lfqV9VT50k0uil1ymfZYuGA=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/_lEFFa8lYn3XicLJllIi8yi0Y9OT9IiLFx-kDLiul3W-BAWdNuvQyOvNluo=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/St_Louis_night_expblend.jpg/250px-St_Louis_night_expblend.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Gateway Arch, <span>St. Louis</span>, <span>Missouri</span> in the Midwest</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>A long history of <span>hitchhiking</span> comes out of the U.S., with record of automobile hitchhikers as early as 1911. The specifics of the law vary from state to state, but in general, hitchhiking itself is legal throughout the majority of the country, though generally not on Interstate highways (where pedestrians are normally prohibited) or while standing within traffic lanes (usually marked by a solid white line at the shoulder of the road). If you plan to hitchhike, best practice is to thumb rides at entrance ramps, or (better yet) highway rest areas. </p>\n <p>However, due to increasing wariness of the possible dangers (fueled in part by sensational stories in the news media), hitchhiking in the U.S. is much less common than it used to be. International travelers to the U.S. should avoid this practice unless they have either a particularly strong sense of social adventure or extremely little money. Even many Americans themselves would only feel comfortable \"thumbing a ride\" if they had a good knowledge of the locale, and American drivers also practice caution for the same reasons. </p>\n <p><b><a rel=nofollow href=http://craigslist.org target=_blank>Craigslist</a></b> has a rideshare section that sometimes proves useful for arranging rides in advance.

And each state has its own <b>state parks</b> that can be just as good as the federal versions. Most all of these destinations, federal or state, have an admission fee, but it all goes toward maintenance and operations of the parks, and the rewards are well worth it. </p>\n <p>Those aren't your only options, though. Many of America's natural treasures can be seen without passing through admission gates. The world-famous <span>Niagara Falls</span> straddle the border between Canada and the U.S.; the American side lets you get right up next to the onrush and feel the power that has shaped the Niagara gorge. The \"purple majesty\" of the Rocky Mountains can be seen for hundreds of miles in any direction, while the placid coastal areas of the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic have relaxed Americans for generations. And, although they are very different from each other, Hawaii and Alaska are perhaps the two most scenic states; they don't just <i>have</i> attractions—they <i>are</i> attractions. </p>\n <h3> <span>Historical attractions</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/0g6kMcboHMgm9wKDQybxGUQfRxyUyd4x1kvYdk2K4k-89RKjZnCIk6Q=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/YrU_TKYju_YPfN-eO25_QoCwM9F2AkLGR0TE1f814fJwo4eXR3UDMWpqIP4=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Taos_Pueblo_%285%29_%2815945350466%29.jpg/220px-Taos_Pueblo_%285%29_%2815945350466%29.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>Taos Pueblo</span>, a <span>UNESCO World Heritage site</span>, and one of the largest pre-Columbian settlements in the southwest.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The U.S. has a tremendous wealth of historical attractions—more than enough to fill months of history-centric touring. </p>\n <p>The <b>prehistory</b> of the continent can indeed be a little hard to uncover, as most of the Native American tribes did not build permanent settlements. But particularly in the <span>West</span>, you will find magnificent cliff dwellings at sites such as <span>Mesa Verde</span> and <span>Bandelier</span>, as well as near-ubiquitous rock paintings (Petroglyph National Park has some of the best rock art in the country, and it is located only 17 km outside of <span>Albuquerque</span>). The Museum of the American Indian in <span>Washington, D.C.</span> is another great place to start learning about America's culture before the arrival of Europeans colonists. </p>\n <p>The first successful British colony on the continent was at <span>Jamestown</span>, Virginia, although the settlement at <span>Plymouth</span>, Massachusetts, may loom larger in the nation's mind. The eastern states of New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the South have more than their fair share of sites from <b>early American history</b> as they make up what are known as the 13 Original Colonies. </p>\n <p>In the 18th century, major centers of commerce developed in <span>Philadelphia</span> and <span>Boston</span>, and as the colonies grew in size, wealth, and self-confidence, relations with Great Britain became strained, culminating in the Boston Tea Party and the ensuing <span>Revolutionary War</span>. </p>\n <p>There are a large number of historic sites related to the <span>American Civil War</span>, the most destructive conflict on American soil. </p>\n <h3> <span>Monuments and architecture</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Americans have never shied away from heroic feats of engineering, and many of them are among the country's biggest tourist attractions. </p>\n <p><b>Washington, D.C.</b>, as the nation's capital, has more monuments and statuary than you could see in a day, but do be sure to visit the Washington Monument (the world's tallest obelisk), the stately Lincoln Memorial, and the incredibly moving Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The city's architecture is also an attraction—the Capitol Building and the White House are two of the most iconic buildings in the country and often serve to represent the whole nation to the world. </p>\n <p>A number of American cities have world-renowned skylines, perhaps none more so than the concrete canyons of <b>Manhattan</b>, part of New York City. There, a new World Trade Center tower has risen on a site adjacent to the fallen twin towers, and the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building still stand tall, as they have for almost a century. <b>Chicago</b>, where the skyscraper was invented, can no longer claim the <i>tallest</i> building in the country, but it still has an awful lot of <span><i>really tall</i> buildings</span>.

America's passion for sports is rivaled hardly anywhere in the world, with the leagues with the world's highest attendance both per game (NFL) and total (MLB) and other leagues that are the best and most popular in their respective sport. Watching a game is a good way to meet and interact with the locals. A few of the most popular sports are: </p>\n <table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=1><tbody><tr><td> <p><b>\"Hockey\" vs \"Ice hockey\"</b></p>\n <p>In most English-speaking countries, \"hockey\" is used for a game played on grass and \"ice hockey\" for the one on ice. In North American usage, however, the former is called \"field hockey\", while \"hockey\" alone almost always means \"ice hockey\" (or, rarely, roller hockey). </p>\n </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>One unique feature of the American sports landscape is the extent to which sports are associated with educational institutions. In many regions, <b>college sports</b> (local or university teams), especially in football and men's basketball, enjoy followings that rival or surpass those of major professional teams. (In fact, 8 of the 10 largest stadiums in the world — all seating more than 100,000 spectators — are for U.S. college football teams, and the country's four largest basketball arenas house college teams.) The <b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.ncaa.com target=_blank>NCAA</a></b> (National Collegiate Athletic Association) has over 1,000 member schools, including almost all of the country's best-known colleges and universities. The <b>college football</b> season runs from roughly September 1 through mid-December, with postseason bowl games running into early January. The <b>college basketball</b> regular season begins in mid-November and ends in late February or early March, followed by post-season tournaments that run through early April. The NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, <b>\"March Madness\"</b>, is especially widely followed even by casual sports fans. <b>Rowing</b> enthusiasts may wish to watch the <b>Harvard–Yale Regatta</b>, a 4-mile-long (6.4 km) race held in <span>Connecticut</span> every year between the men's coxed eight rowing teams. </p>\n <p>Many communities also take great pride in their <b>high school sports</b> teams, and especially in smaller locales, those teams are a major part of local culture. From August to May, a high school game can be a great (and cheap) way to meet locals and discover the area in a way many visitors never experience. The most popular sports are usually football and boys' basketball (and to a lesser extent girls' basketball), plus hockey in New England and the upper Midwest. In some areas, a particular high school sport enjoys an elevated cultural position. Examples include football in Texas, basketball in Indiana, hockey in Minnesota, and wrestling in Iowa. </p>\n <p>The United States is home to many of the world's most famous <b>golf</b> courses.

Older styles are still frequently seen in circulation.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The official U.S. currency is the <b>United States dollar</b> (<b>$</b>), divided into 100 <b>cents</b> (<b>¢</b>, but often written as decimal dollars). Foreign currencies are almost never accepted, though some major hotel chains may accept traveller's checks in other currencies. Establishments close to the Canadian border accept Canadian currency, though usually at poor exchange rates. The Mexican peso can also be used (again at poor exchange rates) in border towns like <span>El Paso</span> and <span>Laredo</span>. Japanese yen is sometimes accepted in <span>Hawaii</span>. </p>\n <p>The dollar is sometimes colloquially known as a <b>buck</b>, so \"5 bucks\" means $5. Common American banknotes (or bills) are the $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. The $2 bill is still produced but rarely seen in circulation and is occasionally refused as payment; bills beyond $100 haven't been produced since the 1960s and are removed from circulation when found. The $100 and sometimes $50 bills are too valuable for small transactions, and may be refused. All $1 and $2 bills and older bills of the other denominations are greenish and printed with black and green ink (thus the nickname \"greenbacks\"). Newer versions of the $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills are slightly more colorful. All the bills are the same size. Banknotes never expire and several designs of each note can circulate together, but older designs that lack modern anti-counterfeiting features may (rarely) be refused by some retailers. </p>\n <p>The standard coins are the <b>penny</b> (1¢, copper color), the chunky <b>nickel</b> (5¢, silver color), the tiny <b>dime</b> (10¢, silver color) and the ridged-edge <b>quarter</b> (25¢, silver color). These coins only have their values written in words, not figures: \"one cent\", \"five cents\", \"one dime\", and \"quarter dollar\". When it comes to value, size doesn't matter: the dime is the smallest coin, followed by the penny, nickel, and quarter. <b>Half dollar</b> (50¢, silver) and <b>dollar</b> ($1, gold) coins exist but are uncommon. Coin-operated machines usually only accept nickels, dimes, quarters, and $1 bills, though some may also accept dollar coins. Larger vending machines, such as for buses or postal stamps, may take $5, $10, or even $20 bills. Though Canadian coins are sized similarly, machines usually reject them. Humans, on the other hand, generally won't notice (or care about) a few small Canadian coins mixed with American, particularly in the northern parts of the country. As with most currency, coins are generally not exchangeable abroad and UNICEF provides donation boxes at airports to let you dispose of them for a good cause before flying abroad. </p>\n <h3> <span>Currency exchange and banking</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=1><tbody><tr><td> <p><b>Exchange rates for U.S. dollars</b></p>\n <p>As of 31 July 2019: </p>\n <p>Exchange rates fluctuate. Current rates for these and other currencies are available from <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.xe.com/currency/usd-us-dollar target=_blank>XE.com</a></p>\n </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Currency exchange centers are rare outside the downtowns of major coastal and border cities, and international airports. Some banks also provide currency exchange services, though you may sometimes be required to call in advance. Due to the high overhead of exchange rates and transaction fees, it is often better to acquire U.S. dollars in your home country before travel; rates at currency exchange desks in airports, tourist areas and shopping areas in particular are often terrible. </p>\n <p><b>ATMs</b> can handle foreign bank cards or credit cards bearing Visa/Plus or MasterCard/Cirrus logos. They usually dispense bills in $20 denominations and generally charge about $2-4 to cards issued by other banks. Smaller ATMs in restaurants, petrol stations, etc., often charge higher fees (up to $5). These fees are in addition to your card issuer's own fees. Some ATMs, such as those at courthouses or other government buildings, have no fee. As with anywhere else in the world, there is a risk of <b>card skimmers</b> installed on these machines that can steal your credit card details. </p>\n <p>Another option is withdrawing cash (usually up to $40 or $60 over the cost of your goods) when making a debit card purchase at a supermarket, convenience store, or a large discount store such as Walmart. Stores almost never charge for this service (though it may be contingent on signing up for the store's loyalty program, which is also usually free); however, the bank that issued your card may impose a fee. </p>\n <p>Opening a bank account in the U.S. is a fairly straightforward process, and there are no restrictions on foreigners having them. </p>\n <h3> <span>Credit and debit cards</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Major credit cards such as Visa and Mastercard (and their debit card affiliates) are widely used and accepted. Nearly all large retailers will accept credit cards for transactions of all sizes, even as small as $1 or $2. However, some small businesses and independently-owned stores specify a minimum amount of money (usually $2 or $5, but sometimes $10) for credit card use, as such transactions cost them $0.30–0.50 (this practice is also common at bars when opening a tab). Almost all sit-down restaurants, hotels, and shops will accept credit and debit cards; those that do not post a sign saying \"Cash Only.\" Other cards such as American Express and Discover are also accepted, but not as widely. Many retailers have a window sticker or counter sign showing the logos of the credit cards they accept. </p>\n <p>JCB, UnionPay (China) and RuPay (India) have alliances with Discover, so they can be used at any retailer that accepts Discover cards even if the store does not display the logo on its window. </p>\n <p>Shops may also ask for photo identification for foreign-issued cards. When making large purchases, it is typical for U.S. retailers to ask to see some form of photo identification. Sometimes, credit/debit cards are the only means to perform a transaction. If you do not have one, you can purchase a prepaid card or gift card with Visa, MasterCard or AmEx logo in a good number of stores, but you may have to provide identification before the card is activated. </p>\n <p>Transaction authorization is made by signing a paper sales slip or a computer pad, although many retailers will waive the signature requirement for small purchases. The U.S. is implementing the EMV \"chip-and-PIN\" credit card authorization system used overseas. Cards and devices (e.g. iPhones and Apple Watches with Apple Pay) issued abroad with contactless or near-field communication (NFC) capabilities may not work in some merchants where NFC/contactless is used; in such cases, swipe or 'chip-and-pin' will be used. </p>\n <p>Gas station pumps, some public transportation vending machines, and some other types of automated vending machines often have credit/debit card readers. Many of these ask for the ZIP code (i.e., postal code) of the U.S. billing address for the card, which effectively prevents them from accepting foreign cards (they are unable to detect a foreign card and switch to PIN authentication). At gas stations, you can use a foreign-issued card by paying the station attendant inside. If you have a Canadian Mastercard, you can use it at all pumps that require a ZIP code by entering the digits of your postal code (ignoring letters and spaces) and adding two zeroes to the end. When using a debit card, some stations will place a hold on your account for a specified amount (a notice will be present on the pump, typically $75) and then update the charge once you've filled up (but there is often a 1-2 day delay between removing the \"hold\" and updating the amount charged). </p>\n <h3> <span>Sales tax</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>There is no federal sales tax (such as VAT or GST), so you cannot claim a tax refund when you leave the U.S. </p>\n <p>Most states have a retail <b>sales tax</b> between 3% and 10%, as do some cities. The goods that are taxed and those that are exempt (often groceries, and pharmaceuticals) vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Restaurant meals are usually taxed. </p>\n <p>Taxes are <b>usually not included in posted prices</b> but are added to your bill, so be prepared for the total to be higher than the listed prices would indicate! </p>\n <p>Some cities have tax zones near airports and business districts that are designed to exploit travellers — sales taxes can vary up to 2% in a matter of a few miles. Regional price variations, however, will usually have more impact on a traveller's wallet than the savings from seeking out a low- or no-sales-tax destination. Some municipalities, such as New York City, also impose a <b>hotel tax</b> on accommodation, which is levied on top of the sales tax. </p>\n <h3> <span>Places for shopping</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p><i>See also <span>Shopping in the United States</span></i></p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/XrRjLOI45GRc-GyOlETWntK5BSZ5mCZa8kTScbq4erRvQBdDea5U-eI=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/JmAdiX9XHfr8GxbGcjV63iEoJW02pTa9SWkfFESXF-3AeTTmJIVlxl2Uavw=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Mall_of_America_interior_three-level_corridor.jpg/220px-Mall_of_America_interior_three-level_corridor.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Mall of America in <span>Bloomington</span>, <span>Minnesota</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>America is the birthplace of the modern enclosed <b>shopping mall</b> and the open-air <b>shopping center</b>. In addition, American suburbs have miles and miles of small <b>strip malls</b> — long rows of small shops with shared parking lots. Large cities have central shopping districts that can be navigated on public transport, but pedestrian-friendly shopping streets are uncommon and usually small. American retail stores are gigantic compared to retail stores in other countries, and have some of the longest business hours in the world, with many chains open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Department stores and other large retailers are usually open from 10AM to 9PM most days, and in November and December, may stay open as long as 8AM to 11PM. Discount stores tend to stay open as late as 10PM or midnight, or may be open 24 hours a day. Most supermarkets are open late into the evening, usually until at least 9PM, and many stay open 24/7. Sunday hours tend to be somewhat shorter, or the stores may close. </p>\n <p>The U.S. pioneered the factory outlet store, in which branded goods are sold for bargain prices, and in turn, the <b>outlet center</b>, a shopping mall consisting primarily of such stores. Outlet centers are found along major Interstate highways outside of most American cities. </p>\n <p>If you see a driveway or yard full of stuff on a summer weekend, it's likely a <b>garage sale</b> (or <b>yard sale</b>), where families sell household items they no longer need. Churches often hold <b>rummage sales</b>, with proceeds generally going to their church or a mission or project they support. </p>\n <p><b>Flea markets</b> (called \"swap meets\" in Western states) have vendors selling all kinds of usually inexpensive merchandise. Bargaining is expected. </p>\n <p><b>Thrift stores</b> are retail stores run by churches, charities, and not-for-profit organizations that take in unwanted or un-needed household items as a donation and re-sell them to support projects they are engaged in. </p>\n <h3> <span>Costs</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/FRypGTbGCTN16P3kW_s0S88qvUJvdUSQfM8o8WC3uxC3we2kBg009TE=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/788dVxZ57U4hausbMUxlx-Udqt_oEwIJ-XLaWlJXFmCt1oD_iB8HZ-FkZkE=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Bald_Eagles_Homer_Alaska_USA.jpg/250px-Bald_Eagles_Homer_Alaska_USA.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Bald Eagles in <span>Homer</span>, <span>Alaska</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The U.S. is generally considered <b>expensive</b> although the cost of living is typically lower than in many other Western countries, whose residents often come to the U.S. to shop. </p>\n <p>A bare-bones budget could be $30–50/day, and you can double that if you stay at motels and eat at cheap cafés. Add on a rental car and hotel accommodation and you'll be looking at $150/day and up. There are regional variations too: large cities like <span>New York</span> and <span>San Francisco</span> are expensive, while prices go down in rural areas. Most U.S. cities have suburbs with good hotels that are often much cheaper than those in the city center. Thus, if you plan to rent a car and drive between several major cities on a single visit to the U.S., it is usually a better idea to stay at safe suburban hotels with free parking, rather than downtown hotels that charge exorbitant parking fees. </p>\n <p>If you intend to visit any <span>United States National Parks</span>, such as the <span>Grand Canyon</span> or <span>Yellowstone National Park</span>, it is worth considering buying a <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm target=_blank>National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass</a>, which gives you access to almost all of the federal parks and recreation areas for one year. </p>\n <p>Many hotels and motels offer discounts for members of certain organizations which anyone can join, such as AAA (the American Automobile Association). If you're a member, or are a member of a club affiliated with AAA (such as the Canadian Automobile Association, the Automobile Association in the UK, or ADAC in Germany), it's worth asking at check-in. Many chain motels/hotels also have frequent customer plans that offer loyalty discounts. </p>\n <h3> <span>Tipping</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p><span>Tipping</span> is widely practiced in the United States. Standards vary, but gratuities are always given to servers in restaurants and bars, taxi drivers, parking valets, and bellstaff in hotels. The salaries made in these professions, and even their taxes, take into account that they will be tipped, so it really is inappropriate to leave them out. </p>\n <table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=1><tbody><tr><td> <p><b>Thinking about Tipping</b></p>\n <p>Tipping in many countries is very rare or often not done at all, and unthinkable to some visitors. It is, however, an <i>essential</i> part of your trip to the United States, and you will upset people greatly by refusing to tip or tipping too little, as doing so deprives servers of what is often the main component of their income. A good way to approach this is to treat all prices in a restaurant or other service as having a 20% tax and adjust accordingly — i.e. that $40 meal actually costs $48. </p>\n </td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Tipping in the United States is so common and expected in some cases that in many service establishments, such as hair salons and restaurants, customers who did not tip are often asked to pay a tip, or in rare cases verbally scolded by staff for \"stiffing\" them. </p>\n <p>While Americans themselves often debate correct levels and exactly who deserves to be tipped, generally accepted standard rates are: </p>\n <p>The legal minimum wage for restaurant waitstaff and other tip-earners is quite low (just $2.13/hour before taxes in some states where minimums for other workers are $7.25 or more). Therefore, tipping for this service is regarded as even more essential. If you receive exceptionally poor or rude service and the manager does not correct the problem when you bring it to their attention, a deliberately small tip (one or two coins) will express your displeasure more clearly than leaving no tip at all (which may be construed as a forgotten tip). </p>\n <p>If paying your bill by cash, leave a cash tip on the table when you leave (there is no need to hand it over personally or wait until it's collected), or if paying by credit card you can add it directly to the charge slip when you sign it. Look carefully, as the slip will generally inform you whether a 15% gratuity has already been added. </p>\n <p>The rules for tipping at <b>fast-food</b> places are different and a bit more complicated. The key thing to remember is that tipping is associated with table service. The procedure at fast-food restaurants and when ordering takeout (even from what is otherwise a sit-down restaurant) is inherently self-service, therefore tipping is not necessary. Some eateries, mostly in the <b>fast-casual</b> sector, have a \"tip jar\" at the checkout station, but tipping in that scenario is purely optional, and you wouldn't be expected to contribute much more than the coins you're handed back as change. At <b>cafeterias</b> and <b>buffets</b>, a small tip is expected since staff often clear the table for you and provide refills of drinks and such. </p>\n <p>The rules for tipping <b>concierges</b> are also arcane. For most services — asking for maps, information, tours, etc. — a tip is not expected. But for things above and beyond like special, unusual, time-consuming requests, if you receive a lot of attention while others are waiting, or even just for an exceptionally high level of service, tips should generally be large, usually starting at $5 (a $1 tip would be insulting). </p>\n <p>Tipping well can make you look good in front of your American friends, dates and business partners, and could even earn you preferential treatment from staff, with the reverse also being true for tipping poorly. </p>\n <h2> <span>Eat</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <dl><dd><i>Main article: <span>American cuisine</span></i></dd></dl> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/HbO8Nno6xZ9FUqIZSfiSTtpByR5FLw8bfxjArKDUb8AkWI_7s4D19ic=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/IyMy9ebkInK-iluZ5KnV8ph3mdDP_irF4pxfJNoMf47gLwRE7xbxe62Wiio=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Silver_Diner_Interior_View.jpg/220px-Silver_Diner_Interior_View.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Inside a 1950s-style diner, a quintessentially American institution</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The variety of restaurants throughout the U.S. is remarkable. In a major city such as New York, it may be possible to find a restaurant from nearly every country in the world. In addition to the usual array of independent restaurants, the U.S. possesses a singularly baffling array of <span>fast food</span> and casual chain restaurants; even if you think you know U.S. fast food from the chains' international outlets, the sheer variety domestically is immense. </p>\n <p>Ethnic cuisine from other parts of the world is frequently adapted to American tastes and/or made with locally available ingredients. This is particularly true of Chinese (see below) and other Asian cuisines. </p>\n <p>Many restaurants, especially those serving fast food or breakfast, do not serve alcohol, and many others may only serve beer and wine. Portions are generally huge, regardless of restaurant style, although this trend has moderated as customers are becoming more health-conscious. Many restaurants offer several portion options, though it may not be immediately obvious. Ask when ordering if portion choices are available. Taking home \"leftovers\" is very common and is a good way to get two meals for the price of one. Ask for a to-go box at the end of your meal if you have not cleared your plate. </p>\n <p>In much of America, home-cooked food is as good as or substantially better than typical restaurant fare. This is particularly true in rural areas and small towns. If you have the opportunity to attend a <b>potluck</b> or <b>carry-in dinner</b>, this is a chance not to be missed. </p>\n <h3> <span>Places to eat</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Large cities host many examples of every type of restaurant imaginable from inexpensive neighborhood eateries to extravagant <b>full-service</b> restaurants with extensive wine lists and prices to match. Most medium-sized cities and suburbs will also field a decent selection. In the most upscale restaurants, rules for men to wear jackets and ties, while once <i>de rigueur</i>, are becoming more relaxed. Check with the restaurant if in doubt. </p>\n <p><b>Takeout</b> food is common in larger cities for meals that may take a little longer to prepare than in a fast-food place. Place an order by phone or online and then go to the restaurant to pick it up and take it away. Many places also offer <b>delivery</b>; in some cities, it is easier to have pizza or Chinese food delivered than to find a sit-down restaurant. Pizza and Chinese are especially ubiquitous for delivery or takeout in the U.S.; towns as small as 5,000 typically have at least one pizza shop and one Chinese takeout/delivery restaurant, and often more than one. Hardcore pizza fans will usually prefer local pizza places to the big national chains; many such restaurants also offer takeout and delivery. </p>\n <p><b><span>Fast-casual</span></b> restaurants offer a fast-food dining style (i.e. no table service), but the meals tend to be fresher and healthier. The food takes a bit longer to prepare — and costs a few dollars more — than at fast food joints, but it's generally worth it. Some fast-casual places even serve alcohol. </p>\n <p><b>Diners</b> are quintessentially American and have remained popular since their heyday in the 1940s and 50s. They are usually individually run, open 24-hours and found on major roads, though they also appear in large cities and suburbs. They offer a wide variety of huge meals that often include soup or salad, bread, beverage and dessert. They are usually busy for breakfast, in the morning, at the end of factory shifts, or after the bars close. </p>\n <p>No compendium of American restaurants would be complete without mentioning the <b><span>truck stop</span></b>. You will only encounter these places if you are taking an intercity auto or bus trip. They are found on the interstate highways and cater to truckers. There will be diesel fuel and separate parking for the \"big rigs\" and showers for the drivers who sleep in their cabs. These fabled restaurants serve what passes on the road for \"plain home cooking\": hot roast beef sandwiches, meatloaf, fried chicken, and of course the ubiquitous club sandwich or burger and fries, served in large portions, often 24 hours a day. \"All you can eat\" buffets and large breakfasts abound. Truckers know their eating: if there are plenty of trucks outside, it'll be good. </p>\n <p><b><span>Chain</span></b> sit-down restaurants have a more predictable level of quality and price compared to local diners and truck stops, although those with discerning palates will probably still be disappointed. Some specialize in a type of food (e.g. seafood, all-day breakfast) or a particular national cuisine, while others have broader offerings. </p>\n <p>For the backpacker or those on very restricted budgets, American <b>supermarkets</b> offer an almost infinite variety of packaged or processed foods that are either ready or almost ready for consumption, including breakfast cereal, ramen noodles, canned soups, and frozen meals. </p>\n <p>In the largest cities, <b>corner stores</b> abound. These small convenience stores carry a variety of snacks, drinks, and packaged foods. Unlike most convenience stores, their products are sold at relatively low prices (especially by urban standards) and can provide snacks or even simple meals for a budget no more than $5 a day. </p>\n <h3> <span>Types of food</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/O8Noqc32jsSl0dYKObIApe9HwlfhZKOQKtJWURtjdAUdgDdiUSVU1rs=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/IyYcubSBCLw0gYerDR4UdsZSYuCeZ0hLSDTikblH_J6uy2W8s7UVEQ005gk=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Cheeseburger.jpg/220px-Cheeseburger.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>A cheeseburger</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Popular American food items include hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, ice cream, and pie.

Alcoholic beverages are not served in these restaurants; soft drinks are standard. Don't be surprised when you order a soda, are handed a paper cup and expected to fill it yourself from the soda fountain (refills are often free). The quality of the food varies, but because of the strictly limited menu, it is generally good, especially in the daytime. Also the restaurants are usually clean and bright, and the service is limited but friendly. A few restaurants, called <b>drive-ins</b>, serve you directly in your car. Most fast food places offer <b>drive-thru</b> service, allowing you to place an order from the establishment's menu posted on the side of a dedicated auto lane, and then paying for it and having it handed to you (packaged to go) at a separate side window before driving to your next destination. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/y1-VUNJx45owqPXx_oZbzXVDq38iahEdczhtJSwWgPwvhyaFZY0_SAY=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/l6RrNyN5pIw1PrUR5Ct6C4jDEQMsaZ-q7JjjTo5vHkQTNSnQZkKCEvmD7fU=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Tips_n_slaw.jpg/220px-Tips_n_slaw.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Rib tips in <span>Memphis</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>At its best, <b>barbecue</b> (often abbreviated \"BBQ\") is pork or beef ribs, beef brisket, or pork shoulder slowly wood-smoked for hours. Ribs are served as a whole- or half-rack or cut into individual ribs, brisket is usually sliced thin, and the shoulder can be shredded (\"pulled\") or chopped. Sauces of varying spiciness may be served on the dish, or provided on the side. There are also unique regional styles of barbecue, with the best generally found in the <span>South</span>. Barbecued meat can be served with a variety of sides, including chili, corn on the cob, coleslaw and potato salad. Barbecue restaurants are unpretentious and the best food is often found at very casual establishments. Expect plastic dinnerware, picnic tables, and sandwiches on cheap white bread. Barbecue found on the menu at a fancy chain or non-specialty restaurant is likely to be less authentic. Ribs and chicken are eaten with your fingers; tackle pork and brisket either with a fork or in a sandwich. Some Americans (though never Southerners) use \"barbecue\" as a synonym for \"cookout\": a party where the likes of chicken, hamburgers, and hot dogs are grilled outdoors (rather than smoked). These can be fun, but are not to be confused with the above. </p>\n <p>With a rich tradition of immigration, America has a wide variety of <b>ethnic foods</b> — everything from Ethiopian cuisine to Laotian food is available in major cities with large immigrant populations — and they're even beginning to cross-pollinate into <b>fusion</b> restaurants, with menus that are a mix of two or more different types of cuisine. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/YtkbaORYhB176XEcapkSNlRtXv2K8ys2q1j6521P_-S-pZKGV8v24Nc=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/DYh5nqh9SD6k3e2RjTsVmhqz0AFThE-Aq_SxjLi0vfpvuFEt927CXNxKmYo=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/New_York_Pizza_Slices.png/220px-New_York_Pizza_Slices.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>These slices of pizza are from New York, but you can get pizza like this in many pizza parlors throughout the Northeast and beyond</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><b>Italian food</b> is perhaps the most pervasive of ethnic cuisines in America, almost to the point where its \"foreign-ness\" is debatable. While more authentic fare is certainly available in fancier restaurants, Italian food in the U.S. has often taken a different direction than that of <span>Italy</span> itself, especially in terms of pizza, which <span>in the United States</span> is available in a myriad of homegrown styles that are famous regionally and sometimes nationwide, but unknown in Italy. There are also restaurants that specialize in <b>Greek</b> and <b>Middle Eastern</b> cuisines (with <i>feta</i> cheese and <i>hummus</i> fairly widespread on supermarket counters), and in somewhat smaller numbers also <b>German</b> and <b>French</b> restaurants. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/WKL4BBUsHaCVQWw5tpYpSUg7OdMbIHi-dDHwSWmv7zjtMghyDYji2hc=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/QIm6_P65iPCF_KvSqQKoCtyN9YqzuWrxpD-NWf4hT9040fGVy0ATTPMJKrg=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Sushi_13.JPG/220px-Sushi_13.JPG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Sushi is one of the most common Asian dishes in the U.S.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><b>Chinese food</b> is widely available and adjusted to American tastes. Authentic Chinese food can be found in restaurants in Chinatowns in addition to communities with large Chinese populations. Japanese <b>sushi</b>, <b>Vietnamese</b>, and <b>Thai food</b> have also been adapted for the American market, with dedicated restaurants in larger towns. <b>Indian</b> and <b>Korean</b> restaurants are also present. </p>\n <p>Also very popular is <b>Latin-American cuisine</b>, especially Mexican, which for many years came almost exclusively in the form of <b>Tex-Mex cuisine</b>: a homegrown hybrid originally developed in <span>Texas</span> but based on an Americanized interpretation of the cuisine of <span>Northern Mexico</span>. Nonetheless, the small authentic Mexican <i>taquerias</i> that were once limited mostly to <span>California</span> and the <span>Southwest</span> have now spread throughout the country. You'll also find <b>Cuban</b> food in <span>South Florida</span> and <b>Puerto Rican</b> and <b>Dominican</b> restaurants in Northeastern coastal cities, both generally serving a more authentic and less Americanized product. </p>\n <p>The <b>Jewish community</b> has given a great deal to the culinary scene. While full-fledged <b>Kosher delis</b> are a dying breed that are nowadays mostly relegated to New York City and other places with exceptionally large Jewish populations, some specialties like <b>bagels</b> and <b>pastrami</b> have entered the culinary mainstream and are now enjoyed nationwide by Americans of all types. Note that most American Jewish cuisine (like most American Jews) are of Ashkenazi extraction; Sephardi and Mizrahi food is largely unknown in the U.S. </p>\n <h3> <span>Dietary restrictions</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Restaurants catering to <b>vegetarians</b> are becoming more common in the U.S. Most big cities and college towns will have restaurants serving exclusively or primarily vegetarian dishes. In smaller towns you may have more of a challenge. Waitstaff can answer questions about menu items, but may consider dishes with beef or pork flavoring, fish, chicken, or egg to be vegetarian. This is especially common with vegetable side dishes in the South. Meat-free breakfast foods such as pancakes or eggs are readily available at diners. <b>Vegan</b> restaurants (and vegan options at other restaurants) are increasingly appearing, especially in large cities. </p>\n <p>People on low-fat or low-calorie diets should be fairly well-served in the U.S. Even fast-food restaurants tend to have a few healthier options on the menu, and can provide charts of calorie and fat counts on request. </p>\n <p>Awareness of <b>food allergies</b> varies. Packaged food must be labeled if it contains milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, or soy. Packaged food must also list its ingredients, although this can include non-specific items like \"spices\", \"seasonings\", or \"added color\". But there is usually no obligation to label allergens in unpackaged food, e.g. in restaurants, bakeries, and fresh food at grocery stores (but laws vary by state). Some restaurants do label allergens, and cater to those with food allergies. Fast food and casual-dining chain restaurants are often a safer bet for people with food allergies as they have consistent ingredients and methods. At sit-down restaurants, inform your waiter, ask questions, and if your waiter is unsure of anything then have them double-check or insist on speaking to a chef. A large selection of <b>gluten-free</b> foods are available, but like other allergens, the labeling laws (must contain less than 20 ppm gluten) apply to packaged food but not restaurants. </p>\n <p>People on <b>religious diets</b> should not have any problems finding what they need in the major cities. Most major cities have at least one <i>halal</i> and <i>kosher</i> butcher, and there are often restaurants serving those respective communities too. <b><a rel=nofollow href=https://thehalalguys.com/ target=_blank>The Halal Guys</a></b> is a uniquely American chain of halal restaurants that operates branches in many major cities. However, such food is often not available at all in small towns and rural areas. </p>\n <h3> <span>Etiquette</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>It is usually inappropriate to join a table already occupied by other diners, even if it has unused seats; Americans prefer this degree of privacy when they eat. Exceptions include cafeteria-style eateries with long tables and crowded informal eateries and cafés where you may have success asking a stranger if you can share the table they're sitting at. Striking up a conversation in this situation may or may not be welcome. </p>\n <p>Table manners, though varied, are typically European-influenced. Slurping or making other noises while eating are considered rude, as is loud conversation (including phone calls). It is fairly common to wait until everybody at your table has been served before eating. You should lay cloth napkins across your lap; you can do the same with paper napkins or keep them on the table. </p>\n <p>Many fast food items (sandwiches, burgers, pizza, tacos, etc.) are designed to be eaten by hand; a few foods are almost always eaten by hand (French fries, bacon, barbecue ribs, and many appetizers) even at moderately nice restaurants. If unsure, eating so-called \"finger foods\" with a fork and knife probably won't offend anyone; eating fork-and-knife food by hand might. </p>\n <p>Offense isn't taken if you don't finish your meal; most restaurants will package the remainder to take with you, or provide a box for you to do this yourself (sometimes euphemistically called a \"doggy bag\", implying that the leftovers are for your pet). If you want to do this, ask the server to get the remainder \"to go\"; this will be almost universally understood, and will not cause any embarrassment. Some restaurants offer an \"all-you-can-eat\" buffet or other service; taking home portions from such a meal is either not allowed or carries an additional cost. </p>\n <p>When invited to a meal in a private home, you might ask if you can contribute something to the meal, such as a dessert, a side dish, wine or beer, or for an outdoor cookout, something useful like ice or disposable cups or plates. The host will often decline, especially since you're a traveller. If you aren't asked to contribute to the meal, it is considered good manners to bring along a small gift for the host (often called a <b>hostess gift</b>). A bottle of wine, box of candies or fresh cut flowers are most common. You should not expect your gift, if it's food, to be served with the meal; the host has already selected the meal's components. Gifts of cash or very personal items (e.g. toiletries) are not appropriate. </p>\n <p>An exception is the <b>potluck</b> or <b>carry-in</b> meal, where each guest (or group/family) brings a food dish to share with everyone; these shared dishes make up the entire meal. Usually dishes are grouped (e.g., salads, main dishes or casseroles, side dishes, <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>, desserts); you should ask the host if they want you to bring something in particular. Ideal dishes for a potluck should be served from a large <i>pot</i>, dish, or bowl, and are usually served buffet style—hence the emphasis on salads, casseroles, and bite-sized foods. These types of meals typically offer a wide assortment of well-prepared foods and may be the very best way to experience authentic American cuisine—and your foreign specialty might just be the star attraction! </p>\n <h3> <span>Smoking</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Whether you are allowed to smoke in a bar or restaurant or other public indoor space varies between, and even within, states. In most cases, it is banned. If there is a \"No Smoking\" sign, lighting up may get you ejected, fined, or even arrested, in addition to dirty looks. </p>\n <p>Smoking has acquired a social stigma, even where it is permitted. You may want to ask the people around you whether they mind before lighting up. Many states have laws about smoking near public entrances: keep an eye out for posted signs stating a minimum distance to the door although enforcement is not consistent. Typically, if you find an ash tray or a butt station, you are safe to smoke there. </p>\n <p>As of 2018, some states have legalized recreational and/or medical use of <span>cannabis</span>. In states where cannabis/medical marijuana is legal, a green cross – similar to the logo of the Red Cross, and confusingly similar to the signs for normal pharmacies in other countries – represents a business that sells medical marijuana. Sales in some areas may be limited to local residents or to people with particular medical conditions. Additionally, federal law prohibits handling of cannabis, and transporting cannabis into the country or across state borders, even between states where cannabis is legal, is a crime. It is furthermore unclear how state law (or the jurisdiction of Indian reservations) and federal law collide in terms of cannabis. </p>\n <h2> <span>Drink</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/3GrrARhOXx3XCMMI37D390RAB2e0Cc_J7ZJJqwWGPXWidx2n6Ruoq0w=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/BvbyHbZ6tXCbndw7iq2XAoqeICIOzmQKx3K45WIDtHul4U5ge4te8Hkn-sE=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Bourbon.jpg/250px-Bourbon.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>America's native spirit — bourbon, neat</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Drinking customs in America are as varied as the backgrounds of its many people. In the cities, you can find everything from tough local \"shot and a beer\" bars to upscale \"martini bars\"; urban bars and nightclubs will often serve only simple food, or none at all. In the suburbs, alcohol is mainly served in restaurants rather than bars. And in rural areas, the line between \"bar\" and \"restaurant\" is often blurred to the point of meaninglessness; with few establishments nearby, locals go to the same place for both meals and nightlife. A few states have <b>dry counties</b>, places where it is illegal to sell alcohol for local consumption; these are mostly in rural areas. </p>\n <h3> <span>Laws</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=1><tbody><tr><td> <p><b>Date confusion</b></p>\n <p>Some 21-year-olds trying to use a foreign ID to purchase alcohol may be confounded by an unexpected problem: the <span>date is often in the wrong order</span>! </p>\n <p>In most of the world, a birthdate of <i>12 January 1996</i> would be written <b>12-1-1996</b>, using day-month-year order. But the U.S. invariably uses month-day-year order, in which those numbers would be taken to mean <i>December 1</i>, almost a full year later! Unless your ID specifically states that it uses day-month-year format, or uses [English] names for the month as some passports do, it's likely that your ID won't be accepted, as the employee would otherwise be taking you at your word that you're of age to drink. If you want to avoid the problem, get an alternative ID that shows your birthdate in an unambiguous format. </p>\n </td></tr></tbody></table> <p><b>The drinking age is 21 throughout the U.S.</b> except in most of the outlying territories (where it is 18). Enforcement of this varies, but always carry a valid picture ID in case you are carded. Generally accepted forms of ID are a U.S. driver's license, state ID or passport. Some bars and retailers require IDs on all transactions, and some may not accept a foreign driver's license (except possibly Canada), so having your passport available when purchasing alcohol is strongly advised. In some states, people who are under 21 cannot even legally enter a bar or liquor store — and even where the law allows it, individual bars might still choose not to admit minors. </p>\n <p>Alcohol sales are typically prohibited after 2AM, though there are some cities where bars are open later or even all night. In some states, most stores can only sell beer and wine; hard liquor is sold at dedicated liquor stores. Several \"dry counties\" – mostly in southern states – ban some or all types of alcohol in public establishments; private clubs (with nominal membership fees) are often set up to get around this. Sunday sales are restricted in some areas. </p>\n <p>Most towns ban drinking in the open with varying degrees of enforcement. Even if it is allowed, a visible bottle (rather than one in a small bag) is either illegal or justifies police attention. Being \"drunk and disorderly\" is illegal. <b>Drunk driving</b> comes under fairly harsh scrutiny. A blood-alcohol level of 0.08% is considered \"under the Influence\" and many states consider a level of 0.05% as \"impaired\". If you're under 21, most states have limits of 0.00-0.02%. American police keep a sharp eye out for drunken drivers (especially on holiday weekends), and have an array of tools at their disposal that can quickly determine if you are under the influence. <b>If you are caught driving under the influence of alcohol, you will almost certainly be arrested.</b> Foreigners will typically be deported, even well-established permanent residents. It is also usually against the law to have an open container of alcohol anywhere in a car other than in the trunk; this can be heavily fined. Should you find yourself in a situation where you drank a bit more than you intended and are unsure if you should drive, taxi cabs are fairly prolific in medium to large cities, and ride-hailing apps have drivers even in small cities. Many automotive clubs offer hotlines to find a ride home. </p>\n <h3> <span>Drinks</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p><b>Beer</b> and <b>wine</b> are the main non-distilled alcoholic drinks, with <b>whiskey</b> the main <i>hard liquor</i> (i.e. distilled drink). \"Cider\" without further qualification is just an unfiltered variety of apple juice. <b>Hard cider</b> is the alcoholic drink from fermented apples; although enthusiastically consumed two centuries ago, its popularity is only now resurging after decades of obscurity. </p>\n <p><b>Beer</b> constitutes approximately half the alcohol consumed in the U.S. Nationally known light lagers (which are cheap and mediocre) remain most prevalent, despite the emergence of other types of beer since the 1990s. <b>Microbreweries</b>, which specialize in small-batch, high-quality beers made by traditional methods, add much-needed variety. Microbrews, also called \"craft beers\", are often inventive and experimental; some are excellent examples of classic beer styles, while others push the limits and develop new, unique flavors. Most are only available locally, but quite a few have reached regional or even national distribution. Some bars and restaurants serve craft beers, while others don't, seemingly at random. Most stores (even convenience stores) carry at least a few, and many have a wide selection. <b>Brew pubs</b> combine microbrewery and bar and serve highly regarded beer that is made on the premises. </p>\n <p><b>Wine</b> is available across the quality spectrum. American wines are labeled primarily by the grape variety. A rough guide to quality comes in the specificity of the labeling. Color alone (\"Red\", \"white\", and \"rosé\" or \"pink\") denotes the lowest echelon. Above this, regions are labeled by state (e.g. \"California\"), an area of a state (e.g. \"<span>Central Coast</span>\"), a county or other small region (e.g. \"Willamette Valley\"), or a specific vineyard (e.g. \"Dry Creek Vineyard\"). </p>\n <p>The cheapest wine tends to come in a plastic bag encased in a box. \"Fortified wines\", known as \"bum wine\", are the precise opposite of high-class European port, sherry or Madeira. </p>\n <p>All 50 states practice some sort of winemaking, though 90% of America's wine—including its most highly regarded from the <b><span>Napa Valley</span></b>—are <b>Californian</b>. Wines from Oregon's <b><span>Willamette Valley</span></b> and <b><span>Washington state</span></b> represent good value as they are less well known. <b><span>Michigan</span></b>, <b><span>Colorado's Wine Country</span></b>, and New York State's <b><span>Finger Lakes</span></b> produce German-style whites which have won international competitions. The <b><span>Llano Estacado</span></b> region of Texas is also notable for its wines. </p>\n <p><b>Sparkling wines</b> are available by the bottle in upscale restaurants, and are also sometimes served by the glass. The best Californian sparkling wines have been rated comparably to leading French champagnes but they are not commonly sold in supermarkets outside of California. </p>\n <p><b>Sparkling cider</b> is usually a non-alcoholic drink that comes in the shape of a champagne bottle and can be flavored. <b>Hard Ciders</b> are those that contain alcohol in them. </p>\n <p>Most bars, except urbane wine bars, serve unremarkable wine. Wine is taken quite seriously by some restaurants, but as with all other alcoholic drinks in restaurants, expect to pay up to four times the liquor store price for a bottle. </p>\n <p><b>Hard alcohol</b> (i.e. spirits) is usually drunk with mixers, but it is also served \"on the rocks\" (with ice) or \"straight\" (unmixed, with no ice, also called \"neat\"). Whiskey, the traditional choice, remains popular despite the increased popularity of vodka and other clear spirits. <b>Whiskey</b> is distilled from many different grains. The main types are rye, malt (made with mainly barley) and bourbon (made with mainly corn, i.e. maize). </p>\n <h3> <span>Nightlife</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/rR-YvP-krczhpvfrlLlTSA0Lu7VyEfUJvDj0XSkEaYjTqEtnVOvGDfg=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/kBosK58ACPILq8kh0huClYTXXRVugXkkPpIv-rHC4i7Y-gZy6l1Rqh8Fm-U=/wikivoyage/en/thumb/6/61/LasVegas_Riviera_Neon.JPG/250px-LasVegas_Riviera_Neon.JPG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The bright lights of Sin City, <span>Las Vegas</span>, <span>Nevada</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Nightclubs in America run the usual gamut of various music scenes, from discos with top-40 dance tunes to obscure clubs serving tiny slices of obscure musical genres. Country music dance clubs, or <b>honky tonks</b>, are laid fairly thick in the South and West, especially in rural areas and away from the coasts, but one or two can be found in almost any city. Also, gay/lesbian nightclubs exist in nearly every medium- to large-sized city. </p>\n <p><b>\"Happy hour\"</b>, a period usually lasting from 30 minutes to three hours, usually between 5PM and 8PM, sees significant discounts on selected drinks. \"Ladies' nights\", during which women receive a discount, are increasingly common. </p>\n <p>Until 1977, the only U.S. state with legalized gambling was <span>Nevada</span>. The state has allowed games of chance since the 1930s, creating such resort cities as <span>Las Vegas</span> and <span>Reno</span> in the process. Dubbed \"Sin City,\" Las Vegas in particular has evolved into an end-destination adult playground, offering many other after-hours activities such as amusement parks, night clubs, strip clubs, shows, bars and four star restaurants. Gambling has since spread outside of Nevada to a plethora of U.S. cities like <span>Atlantic City</span>, <span>New Jersey</span> and Biloxi, Mississippi, as well as to riverboats, offshore cruises and Indian reservations. State lotteries and \"scratch games\" are another, popular form of legalized gambling. However, online gaming and wagering on sports across state lines remains illegal in the U.S. </p>\n <h3> <span>Non-alcoholic beverages</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The United States has a wide variety of <b><span>soft drinks</span></b> with some of the most famous brands originating here. While Pepsi and Coca-Cola are sold around the world, some flavors are hardly known outside North America. Sparkling water, once seen as a European curiosity, has become increasingly popular as a healthier alternative to sugary soft drinks and is now available in most stores. <b>Tap water</b> is usually served for free at restaurants, and in most parts of the country other than the New York City area, you will generally get free refills of coffee, tea, and (somewhat less often) soft drinks. Americans like to put a lot of ice into their drinks, so unless you specifically request otherwise, expect any non-alcoholic drink you order in a restaurant (including water) to contain a large quantity of ice cubes. When ordering water at fast food restaurants, bottled water may be assumed if you don't specify tap water. </p>\n <h2> <span>Sleep</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/x44KWNf69wmcOj-UZhtjCKzZfnbbN_J1YN_cCoXQG7-pd-SQkTNMjVY=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/helMjLsdqJTdO-EFOjLM7OJZn6AnX1bNu9qCpFAnxvAO-bTBNfn4GKYWePY=/wikivoyage/en/thumb/8/84/Seligman_SupaiMotel.JPG/250px-Seligman_SupaiMotel.JPG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Classic 1950s motel in <span>Seligman</span>, <span>Arizona</span>, along <span>Route 66</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>By far the most common form of lodging in rural United States and along many Interstates is the <b>motel</b>. Providing inexpensive rooms to automotive travelers, most motels are clean and reasonable with a limited array of amenities: telephone, TV, bed, bathroom. <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.motel6.com/ target=_blank>Motel 6</a> (<abbr title=phone>☏</abbr><bdi><span><span>+1-800-466-8356</span></span></bdi>) is a national chain with reasonable rates ($30–70, depending on the city). <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.super8.com/ target=_blank>Super 8 Motels</a> (<abbr title=phone>☏</abbr><bdi><span><span>+1-800-800-8000</span></span></bdi>) provide reasonable accommodations throughout the country as well. Reservations are typically unnecessary, which is convenient since you don't have to arbitrarily interrupt a long road trip; you can simply drive until you're tired then find a room. Often they will also light up their sign outside to tell if there is vacancy, in which case you can simply walk in if they have one. However, some are used by adults looking to book a night for sex or illicit activities and many are located in undesirable areas. </p>\n <p>Business or extended-stay hotels are increasingly available across the country. They can be found in smaller towns across the Midwest or in coastal urban areas. Generally they are more expensive than motels, but not as expensive as full-scale hotels, with prices around $70 to $170. While the hotels may appear to be the size of a motel, they may offer amenities from larger hotels. </p>\n <p>Some extended-stay hotels are directed at business travelers or families on long-term stays (that are often relocating due to corporate decisions). These hotels often feature kitchens in most rooms, afternoon social events (generally by a pool), and serve continental breakfast. Such \"suite\" hotels are roughly equivalent to the <b>serviced apartments</b> seen in other countries, though the term is not generally used in American English. </p>\n <p><b>Hotels</b> are available in most cities and usually offer more services and amenities than motels. Rooms usually run about $80–300 per night, but very large, glamorous, and expensive hotels can be found in most major cities, offering luxury suites larger than some houses. Check-in and check-out times are almost always fall in the range of 11AM-noon and 2PM-4PM, respectively. Some hotels in the U.S. will not take people under the age of 21 if not checking in with older adults. Many U.S. cities now have \"edge cities\" in their suburbs which feature high-quality upscale hotels aimed at affluent business travelers. These hotels often feature all the amenities of their downtown/CBD cousins (and more), but at less exorbitant prices. A minority of hotels are dog-friendly, with even fewer allowing other types of pets; either way you'll likely need to pay a surcharge and a refundable damage deposit. Amenities such as wi-fi and breakfast are usually free in mid-range hotels, but often not available at all in the cheapest motels, and only available for exorbitant prices in luxury hotels. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/q0bLXvulan2x0jb-qN_PNwmT37xz4MKwJ9MLaKw-lpwOCpTh2tmXH4E=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/C6DsIwCgii3LuZnQeVCFXJtkRVwMDO4BaEWKgxSHD9mhe8bOtmGV5N4no4g=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Inn_on_the_Main%2C_Canandaigua%2C_NY.jpg/220px-Inn_on_the_Main%2C_Canandaigua%2C_NY.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Many bed &amp; breakfasts are in old, antique or historic houses</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>In many rural areas <b>bed and breakfast</b> (B&amp;B) lodging can be found that are usually in converted houses.

Unlike Europe, most American bed and breakfasts are unmarked. </p>\n <p>The two best-known hotel guides covering the U.S. are the AAA (formerly American Automobile Association; typically pronounced \"Triple-A\") TourBooks, available to members and affiliated auto clubs worldwide at local AAA offices; and the Mobil Travel Guide, available at bookstores. There are several websites booking hotels online; be aware that many of these sites add a small commission to the room rate, so it may be cheaper to book directly through the hotel. On the other hand, some hotels charge more for \"drop-in\" business than reserved rooms or rooms acquired through agents and brokers, so it's worth checking both. </p>\n <p><b><span>Youth hostels</span></b> haven't really taken off in the U.S., but they exist across the country. Some are affiliated with the <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.hiayh.org/ target=_blank>American Youth Hostel</a> organization (a Hostelling International member). Quality of hostels varies widely, but at $8–$24 per night, the prices are unbeatable. Despite the name, AYH membership is open to people of any age. Non-AYH hostels are also available, particularly in larger cities. Hostels are clustered in more touristy locations: do not assume that all mid-sized cities will have a hostel, and even very big cities may only have one or two. </p>\n <p><b>Camping</b> can also be an affordable lodging option, especially with good weather. The downside is that most campgrounds are outside urban regions, so it's not much of an option for trips to big cities. There is a huge network of <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.nps.gov/ target=_blank>National Parks</a> (<abbr title=phone>☏</abbr><bdi><span><span>+1-800-365-2267</span></span></bdi>), with most states and many counties having their own park systems, too. Most state and national campgrounds are of excellent quality, with beautiful natural environments. Expect to pay $7–$20 per car on entry. <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.koakampgrounds.com/ target=_blank>Kampgrounds of America</a> (KOA) has a chain of commercial campground franchises across the country, of significantly less charm than their public-sector equivalents, but with hookups for recreational vehicles and amenities such as laundromats. Countless independently owned private campgrounds vary in character. </p>\n <p>Some <b>unusual</b> lodging options are available in specific areas or by prior arrangement. For example, you might enjoy staying on a <b>houseboat</b> in <span>Lake Tahoe</span> or the Erie Canal. Or stay in a <b>treehouse</b> in Oregon. More conventional lodging can be found at college or university dormitories, a few of which rent out rooms to travelers during the summertime. Finally, in many tourist areas, as well as big cities, you can rent a furnished house by the day. </p>\n <h2> <span>Learn</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <dl> <dd><i>Main article: <span>Studying in the United States</span></i></dd> <dd><i>See also: <span>Touring prestigious and notable universities in the U.S.</span></i></dd> </dl> <p>Studying full-time in the United States is an excellent opportunity for young adults seeking an advanced education, a chance to see a foreign country, and a better understanding of the U.S. and its people. It can be done independently by applying directly to a college for admission, or through the \"study abroad\" or \"foreign exchange\" department of a college in your own country, usually for a single term or one year. The latter is usually easiest; the two institutions will handle much of the arrangements, and you don't have to make a commitment to four years living in a strange country. The U.S. is home to many of the world's most prestigious universities and attracts more international students than any other country in the world, and a lot of cultural diversity can be seen throughout its top universities. </p>\n <h2> <span>Work</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <dl><dd><i>Main article: <span>Working in the United States</span></i></dd></dl> <p>The United States, as the biggest economy in the world, entices foreigners with employment opportunities across the full range of skill levels and economic sectors. Like other countries, though, the U.S. has adopted immigration and visa laws designed to give preference to U.S. residents. Make sure you understand what legal barriers you face to getting a job in the U.S. Do not attempt to work illegally in the U.S., as you could potentially be subject to arrest, deportation, and a ban on re-entry. Illegal workers also run the risk of unsafe work conditions. </p>\n <h2> <span>Stay safe</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <h3> <span>Crime</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Headline-grabbing major crimes give the U.S. a reputation for crime, but few visitors experience any problems; common-sense precautions and staying alert are generally sufficient to avoid trouble. Crime is usually connected with gangs and drugs in the inner cities, and with heated disputes. Avoid those and you'll be fine. Urban tourist areas are heavily policed and are safe from all but petty crimes. </p>\n <p>Rural crime in America tends to be very rare and very local, occurring primarily in very poor, troubled communities which are easy to avoid. Urban areas tend to have homeless people who may aggressively ask for money. If you feel harassed, say \"No\" firmly and walk away. </p>\n <p>Crime rates (including murder rates) are significantly higher in the U.S. than in most of Europe and East Asia, but lower than in most of the rest of the world. However, those rates are somewhat distorted by gang violence and other organized crime that is almost exclusively contained within certain impoverished neighborhoods and members of organized crime groups targeting one another - all things that are unlikely to affect the vast majority of travelers. </p>\n <p>Illegal immigration and drug smuggling, and the authorities' heavy-handed treatment of them, make the Mexican border undesirable to visit. Official border crossings are safe to use. </p>\n <p>There has been a reported increase in mass shootings and white nationalist terrorism since 2016, albeit against the backdrop of a declining number of homicide deaths overall. While these occur in random locations that are nearly impossible to predict, as a tourist, your chances of encountering one are slim. </p>\n <h3> <span>Police</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/kao5bXBkeK4DqMloJ5zY1vg0x1mktqDijWGPKqiyEakuHyBhtYA4Wek=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/x4pm8o2DRVuLSVko08g2PQphzlGjbKtfU6pICCvy4wwdb55Gj4ozJgq-J2k=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/LAPD_Police_Car.jpg/220px-LAPD_Police_Car.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Officers of the Los Angeles Police in a patrol car</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>American police are generally polite, professional, and honest. When in uniform, they are also more formal, cautious, cold and sometimes aggressive than police in, say, Europe or Latin America—especially in large cities. You should expect that police will draw and use their weapons much faster and with more deadly force than police forces in other Western countries. If stopped by police, you should stay calm, be polite and cooperative, avoid making sudden movements, and state what you are doing if you need to reach for your purse or wallet to present your identification. It is particularly important for you to appear calm and cooperative if you are a person of color, since non-white people are much more likely to be subject to police harassment. Turn on the inside car lights and keep your hands on the wheel to make it clear that you are not a threat; do not exit the vehicle unless told to do so. Generally the driver of the car should speak to the officer when they approach. </p>\n <p><b>Do <i>not</i> offer bribes</b> to a police officer under any circumstances. U.S. police culture categorically rejects bribes, and even the mere suggestion can result in your immediate arrest. If you need to pay a fine, don't try to pay the officer; he or she can direct you to the appropriate police station, courthouse, or government office. Most minor traffic infractions can be paid by mail. Increasingly fines can be paid online or over the phone within a matter of minutes of receiving the ticket, though often for a convenience fee of a few dollars. Instructions are often printed on the ticket. Unlike in much of the world, fines are not tied to income and can be rather steep as many towns and counties—controversially—rely on them as a major source of revenue. You should thus be especially careful to comply with the less obvious rules. </p>\n <p>There are three types of police you are most likely to encounter: state police or highway patrol units on major highways, deputy sheriffs employed by county governments in rural areas, and police officers employed by city or town governments in urban areas. There are also smaller police departments, like transit or airport police which patrol public transportation, and university or campus police which patrol universities. Federal law enforcement officers are generally found only in or near federal facilities, such as ports of entry, national parks, and government offices. If you encounter them elsewhere, it is usually because they are investigating specific allegations of federal crimes. </p>\n <h3> <span>Emergency services</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Dialing <b>911</b> at any telephone will reach the emergency services (police, fire, ambulance, etc.). Any U.S. phone, regardless if it is \"active\" or not, must be able to dial 911 if it is connected to the network, and such calls are always free. Unless you are calling from a mobile or Internet-based phone, the operator should be able to locate you from the phone you are using even if you do not say anything. Modern cell phones will send a GPS fix of your location down to a few meters within a few seconds of dialing 911. Dialing 911 and leaving an open line will bring all 3 emergency services to your location in under 5 minutes in most populated areas. Response time may be longer in sparsely populated areas or along the Interstates. </p>\n <p>On any GSM mobile phone (the standard technology in most of the world, especially in Europe), you can also dial <b>112</b>, which is the standard emergency number for GSM networks worldwide. U.S. GSM carriers (AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and smaller regional operators) automatically redirect 112 calls to 911. </p>\n <h3> <span>Border Patrol</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The United States Border Patrol works near both the Canadian and the Mexican borders, as well as in Southern coastal areas like the <span>Florida Keys</span>. They can verify immigration status and enforce immigration laws in the \"border zones\"—generally within 40 miles of Canada and 75 miles of Mexico (although the law allows for 100 miles from any border, including sea and the Great Lakes). Near Canada they tend to be unobtrusive and generally focus their work on long-distance buses and trains. Near the southern border, systematic vehicle checkpoints or being stopped on the street with a friendly \"Papers, please...\" is much more likely. They tend not to target tourists specifically. </p>\n <p>Foreigners are always required to carry their passports, visas, and landing cards (or Green Cards). Being found without them near the border could lead you to being detained until your status is verified, or possibly fined. If your documents are in order, you generally won't be questioned. In most states (<span>Arizona</span> is a notable exception), police and other local authorities are not allowed to question you about your immigration status or to ask to see your passport or visa unless you're arrested and charged with a crime, and then only for the purpose of connecting you with your embassy. As a result of the 9/11 attacks, some statistics have shown that Muslims or those who are assumed to be Muslims may be disproportionately targeted for additional screenings at airports despite claims that passengers are chosen at random. </p>\n <h3> <span>Natural disasters</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/rcZDZHyHtzyZSRGN18Vt5DfFMUO0tp33IoMZea8nR0F0L0UkJR-Cx2g=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/4UAAmGJw8Q9NlMRRKzBlT0OHQvWBdaNIC5hU__JCXlGtdrs5W_irpljyAWQ=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Alfalfa_Tornado_-_NOAA.jpg/220px-Alfalfa_Tornado_-_NOAA.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Tornadoes are more common in the United States than in any other country</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The U.S. is a huge country with very varied geography, and parts of it are occasionally affected by natural disasters: <b>hurricanes</b> and <b>tropical storms</b> from June through November in the <span>South</span> and along the East Coast, <b>blizzards</b> in <span>New England</span>, near the Great Lakes, and in the <span>Rocky Mountains</span>, <b>tornadoes</b> mostly in the <span>Great Plains</span> and Midwest, <b>earthquakes</b> on the West Coast and in <span>Alaska</span>, <b>floods</b> in areas of the Midwest and <b>wildfires</b> in the late summer and early fall in <span>Texas</span> and on the West Coast, particularly <span>California</span>. See the regions in question for more details. </p>\n <p>Because tornadoes are so common between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains, this area has earned itself the colloquial name <b>Tornado Alley</b>. Hawaii contains several active volcanoes, but they are not usually a threat to life and limb. The last high profile eruption in the mainland U.S. was that of Mount Saint Helens in 1980. </p>\n <p>In the case of a natural disaster, local, state or federal authorities can issue a warning over the Emergency Alert System. It has a very distinctive electronic screeching followed by a sound similar to a dial tone prior to any message. It will override AM/FM radio broadcasts as well as TV systems. Smartphones sold since about 2011 will often receive an alert message based on the current location of the phone (depending on the phone's settings, this may include a loud alert tone). Coast Guard weather is broadcast continuously on VHF marine radio for <span>seafarers</span>; a separate system (seven frequencies around 161 MHz) provides conditions ashore. Special \"weather radios\" are able to monitor the frequency, even in standby mode, and sound the alarm if deadly storms (such as tornadoes or hurricanes) are brewing. In most tornado-prone regions, a system of sirens will sound when a tornado warning is issued. If you hear the siren, seek shelter immediately. (For more information, see <i><span>tornado safety</span></i>.) </p>\n <h3> <span>Gay and lesbian</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/2wwW6jsslRl1uPB4Di9AQ2ZbiNACpXFh3qA8-DXx-dfmAuoORijDpm0=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/018psb9Jm66OfZ4eY7QKwWrQSES4Q0UIzwWGksia1CqvMvV33OlCoKqX1ZY=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Castro_Street_Pedcrossing_with_Rainbow_Flag_Colour.JPG/220px-Castro_Street_Pedcrossing_with_Rainbow_Flag_Colour.JPG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>Castro Street</span> pedestrian crosswalk with Rainbow Flag Colors</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>In general, the U.S. is a safe destination for gay and lesbian travelers, though as a whole, homosexuality is not quite as well accepted as in Australia, New Zealand, Canada or Western Europe. Most Americans take a live-and-let-live approach to sexuality, but there are significant exceptions. It's generally not a problem to be open about your sexual orientation, though you may receive unwanted attention or remarks in some situations. Attitudes toward homosexuality vary widely even in regions with a reputation for tolerance or intolerance. Acceptance is most common in major cities throughout the country and smaller cities, suburbs and college towns especially around the Pacific Coast, the Northeast and Hawaii, with acceptance in these areas generally being on par with Western Europe. Homophobia and anti-gay violence may be encountered anywhere, especially in some suburban and rural areas, but the chances of this happening to you are low. </p>\n <p>The 6-color <b>rainbow flag</b> or <b>gay pride flag</b> is widely known even outside the gay community, and is very commonly used by individuals and by gay-friendly businesses. Other symbols (such as the pink triangle, or specific flags for bisexual or transgender people) exist but are much less common. </p>\n <p>Gay-friendly destinations, where openly gay couples are common, include <span>New York</span>'s <span>Chelsea</span>, <span>Rochester</span> in Western <span>New York State</span>, <span>Austin</span>,<span>Chicago</span>'s <span>Boystown</span>, <span>Seattle</span>'s <span>Capitol Hill</span>, <span>San Francisco</span>'s <span>Castro Street</span>, <span>Washington</span>'s <span>Dupont Circle</span>, <span>Miami Beach</span>'s <span>South Beach</span>, <span>Atlanta</span>'s <span>Midtown</span> and <span>Los Angeles</span>' <span>West Hollywood</span>. Even outside of gay neighborhoods, many major cities are gay-friendly, especially in the Northeast and the West Coast. An increasing number of resort areas are known as gay-friendly, including <span>Fire Island</span>, <span>Key West</span>, <span>Asheville</span>, <span>Provincetown</span>, <span>Ogunquit</span>, <span>Rehoboth Beach</span>, <span>Saugatuck</span>, and <span>Asbury Park</span>. In other smaller cities, there are neighborhoods where gay people tend to congregate, and many have resource centers for LGBT people. </p>\n <p>If you're married to someone of the same sex, you may encounter some difficulties in more conservative areas of the country, but Supreme Court rulings have made it clear that no municipal, state or federal authority is allowed to treat same-sex relationships differently from opposite-sex ones. In most jurisdictions, individual businesses remain free to refuse service to gays and lesbians; fewer than twenty states list sexual orientation as a protected category (like race and gender) and fewer still extend these protections to transgender persons. While <b>transgender</b> persons are not prohibited from travel, some have reported undue scrutiny at U.S. airport security checkpoints. A few large cities have enacted local anti-discrimination ordinances and some businesses specifically advertise that they are LGBT-friendly by displaying symbols (typically a rainbow flag) on their storefronts. A few large cities have alternative monthly or weekly <b>publications</b> which provide news and lists of venues or events specifically for the LGBT communities; national LGBT publications include <i><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.out.com/ target=_blank>Out</a></i> magazine and <i><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.theadvocate.com/ target=_blank>The Advocate</a></i>. </p>\n <p>Men planning to engage in any sexual activity should be aware of the heightened risk of HIV and other infections in the United States. A gay American man is 44 times more likely to contract HIV than a heterosexual one, and 46 times more likely to contract syphilis. This risk grows greatly among men likely to engage in one-night stands and other higher-risk behavior. In a nation where 0.5% of the population are infected with HIV, unprotected sex is a very real risk. Precautions, including using protection, are strongly advised during your stay. Most cities have affordable or free testing and treatment centers for STIs, though hours may be limited and waits may be long. <a rel=nofollow href=https://www.plannedparenthood.org/ target=_blank>Planned Parenthood</a> clinics are often an affordable alternative. Seeking health care elsewhere can be very pricey. </p>\n <h3> <span>Drugs</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>In general U.S. drug laws can be pretty severe: even possession or transportation of small amounts can lead to prison or deportation and should be avoided by travelers. However, laws and attitudes concerning the most commonly available drug, <b><span>marijuana</span></b>, vary wildly from state to state. States like Louisiana and Florida impose large fines and lengthy prison sentences, while in other states marijuana use has been largely decriminalized. 18 states allow medical use of marijuana, where persons can obtain marijuana for medicinal use with a doctor's prescription and a \"medical marijuana card\". In some states, particularly cities on the West Coast, medical marijuana dispensaries are so commonplace that they seem almost ordinary. <span>Colorado</span>, <span>Washington state</span>, <span>Oregon</span>, <span>California</span> and <span>Alaska</span> allow limited recreational use of marijuana, as does the <span>District of Columbia</span>, although the status of legalization there is in doubt due to the District's unique Federal status. Under no circumstances should you transport marijuana or other drugs that are illegal under federal law across state lines, onto (some) Indian reservations, onto federal lands (such as federal office buildings, military bases, and post offices) or internationally as doing so is drug trafficking and could subject you to a lengthy prison term. Even if transporting on a direct flight or through the mail between places where marijuana is legal or tolerated such as between the U.S. and the Netherlands, between Washington state and Colorado, or even within a state where marijuana is legal (eg. in California), it is still illegal under U.S. federal law. </p>\n <div><table><tbody><tr> <td><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/ob0F_IZx1Nw0xgnY-yZ9WuyykNsuaERuu_m-GNODeSss-XevqTM9Q30=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/sUjxMArGkOv3lGaLbfIhDPXgCMQcX0PhbQcSx0ySRTqWr8VRZscuk-lSn6M=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Exclamationdiamond_blue.svg/40px-Exclamationdiamond_blue.svg.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></td> <td> <span><b>Note:</b></span> You can be turned away from the U.S. border if you are carrying any substance prohibited by U.S. federal laws, including marijuana.

Possession of firearms is regulated by individual states, and while these regulations (obtaining necessary permits, the kinds of arms permitted) vary greatly from state to state and, sometimes, from city to city within the same state, the U.S. is generally considered to be a place with lenient attitudes towards firearm ownership, especially compared to Europe and Asia. </p>\n <p>Although U.S. citizens have a constitutionally guaranteed right to own and carry firearms, non-immigrant aliens present in America for fewer than 180 days cannot legally possess a firearm or ammunition, unless they travelled specifically for hunting or sport shooting, <i>or</i> they have a valid hunting license from the state they are shooting in. Entry in a recognized shooting competition also qualifies. Anything else is strictly illegal. </p>\n <p><b>Warning:</b> People who have renounced U.S. citizenship are not allowed to possess firearms or ammunition, even for sporting purposes. </p>\n <p>Your chances of getting shot are <b>very low</b>, but bear in mind that: </p>\n <h3> <span>Racism</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Compared to many European and Asian countries, the U.S. is, at least publicly, a racially tolerant country. The U.S. Constitution, coupled with both state and federal legislation and case law, prohibits racial discrimination in a range of public spheres such as employment, university admissions and receiving services from retail businesses. However, the Constitution also guarantees freedom of speech to a greater degree than in most other Western democracies, so it is unfortunately possible to encounter racist comments (both blatant and subtle) in public forums. </p>\n <p>Still, most Americans are, or at least profess to be, tolerant of other races, and it is rare to face open aggression from random people solely as a result of one's race. The country goes through occasional periods of increased animosity toward racial minorities or immigrants, but the longer-term trend has been one of increasing tolerance and acceptance. </p>\n <h2> <span>Stay healthy</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <p><b><span>Tap water</span></b> is potable, but sometimes avoided due to the taste imparted by the chlorine used to purify it. It's of good quality in many places, including <span>New York City</span>; however, it tastes bad in certain low-rainfall areas, such as <span>Santa Barbara</span>, so you might prefer to drink bottled water or seltzer in those places. Bottled water is near ubiquitous and available for a variety of prices. Quality tends to be high and the chemical difference between a 50 cent bottle of water and a 5 dollar bottle of water is oftentimes negligible. Lead plumbing is still a problem in some places, as became evident in the high profile case of <span>Flint</span>, <span>Michigan</span>, but hotels and public water dispensers are unlikely to be affected. </p>\n <h3> <span>Disease</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Being a highly industrialized nation, the United States is largely free from most serious communicable diseases found in many developing nations; however, the <b>HIV rate is higher</b> than in Canada and Western Europe, with about a 0.5% infection rate in the overall population. </p>\n <p>For the latest in traveler's health information pertaining to the United States, including advisories and recommendations, visit the <b>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</b> (<b>CDC</b>) website for <a rel=nofollow href=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/united-states target=_blank>health information for travellers to the United States</a>. </p>\n <p>There are two <span>infectious diseases</span> that are worth becoming educated about: </p>\n <p>Other diseases that are endemic within the United States, but are of far less concern, include <b>Hantaviral Pulmonary Syndrome</b> (found in western regions), <b>Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever</b> (mostly in the Rocky Mountain region), <b>West Nile Virus</b> (all regions) and <b>Eastern/Western Equine Encephalitis</b> (particularly in the Midwest). </p>\n <p>Due to the high amount of travel and the fact that diaspora communities from almost every country in the world have some presence here., the U.S. is somewhat more likely than other places to have \"imported\" cases of pandemics, as seen in the case of the Ebola epidemic of 2014. Again this is unlikely to be of concern to you. </p>\n <h3> <span>Health care</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>American health care is generally first-class, but very expensive. <b>Make sure that your <span>travel insurance</span> is valid for the U.S.</b> Given the high costs, some \"world-wide\" insurance specifically does not cover the U.S. But if you can afford it, the U.S. is by far the world's leading nation in medical research, and you have at your disposal the most cutting edge treatments that are often not available anywhere else. Long-term visitors to the U.S. (e.g., work or student visa holders) are generally required to take up private health insurance as part of their visa conditions. If you are planning to work in the U.S., check with your employer to see if health insurance is provided as part of your employee benefits. </p>\n <p>To the patient, America's public (20%), private for-profit (20%), and private not-for-profit (60%) hospitals are generally indistinguishable. Inner city public hospitals may be more crowded and less well maintained, but as a whole both costs and service levels are consistently high in all types. <b>No hospital can refuse a life-threatening emergency case.</b> Private hospitals may only stabilize such patients before sending them to a nearby public hospital, which will generally act as the regional center for 24-hour emergency treatment. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/S92y_H_Kk4k-qg8FEuHda9SdbftDNpNG7UmKREZTShyedo8AH4OEn20=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/LkiOeN-zwzKzLKid9hvMnpOhbCXPC-aGwE6wrl2wyHSyipdk68CgPlVcV0c=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Med_015_%288185755069%29.jpg/220px-Med_015_%288185755069%29.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Ambulance in <span>Pittsburgh</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>In a life-threatening emergency, call <b>911</b> to summon an ambulance to take you to the nearest <b>hospital emergency room</b> (\"<b>ER</b>\"), or in less urgent situations get to the hospital yourself and register at the ER's front desk. Ambulance fees typically range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, and though they will never refuse to transport you in an emergency, the ambulance fees will be billed to you at a later date. Emergency rooms treat patients regardless of their ability to pay, even though their services are <b>not free</b>. Expect to pay at least $500 for a visit, plus the cost of any specific services or medications you are given. <b>Avoid</b> using ERs for non-emergency walk-in care; they are 3–4 times more expensive than other options and your non-urgent condition means you will have a wait of hours or maybe days. Most urban areas also have minor emergency centers (also called \"urgent care\", etc.) for conditions that don't require a visit to the emergency room (e.g. superficial lacerations). Their hours may be limited; few are open at night. </p>\n <p>Walk-in <b>clinics</b> can provide routine medical care; to find one, check the yellow pages (see <span>By phone</span> below) under \"Clinics\", or call a major hospital and ask. Patients see a doctor or nurse practitioner without an appointment (but often with a bit of a wait). They are typically very up-front about fees, and always accept credit cards. Make sure the clerk knows you will be paying \"out of pocket\"; if they assume an insurance company is paying, they may inflate the bill with unnecessary extras. </p>\n <p><b>Dentists</b> are accustomed to explaining fees over the phone, and most will accept credit cards. Health insurance typically does <i>not</i> provide dental coverage; you will need to take up separate <b>dental insurance</b> for that. </p>\n <p>Government-supported clinics offering free or low-cost testing and treatment for <b>sexually transmitted diseases</b> are widespread. Local Health Departments will provide more details. <a rel=nofollow href=https://www.plannedparenthood.org/ target=_blank>Planned Parenthood</a> (1-800-230-7526) is a private agency with clinics and centers around the country providing birth control and other reproductive health services. </p>\n <p>Note the difference between a red cross and a green cross: in the United States, anything medically related will have a red cross, whereas medical marijuana dispensaries will have a green cross. </p>\n <h2> <span>Cope</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <h3> <span>Religious services</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Christian visitors looking to attend religious services should have no problem locating a house of worship, even in small towns. A typical medium-sized American town or city probably has one or more Catholic parishes, several Protestant churches (the most common being Baptist, Pentecostal, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Methodist and Episcopal/Anglican), and possibly other houses of worship depending on the demographics of the area (such as synagogues or mosques). </p>\n <p>Most churches in the United States practice an \"open table\", meaning they welcome you to participate in worship, and some or all rituals, even if you're not a member of their religious denomination. Some churches, and some entire denominations, welcome LGBT individuals. </p>\n <p>Some churches also have after-church luncheon for free or at a nominal cost. Visitors are always welcome to stay for lunch and fellowship as a way to meet locals. </p>\n <h3> <span>News and media</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Though it's not as ubiquitous as before the advent of the Internet, print media isn't dead yet. Just about every mid-sized city (and many small ones) has a daily newspaper covering local news and often some national news. Major metropolitan areas will usually have more than one paper to choose from. With a few exceptions (mostly tabloids like the <i>New York Post</i> and <i>New York Daily News</i>), most papers provide reasonably balanced coverage of hard news, with their political biases manifesting themselves only in their editorial or opinion sections. </p>\n <p>The national paper of record is <i><b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.nytimes.com/ target=_blank>The New York Times</a></b></i> ($2.50 daily, $6 Sunday); its coverage of national and international issues makes it daily reading just about anywhere in the country. For financial news, <i><b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.wsj.com/ target=_blank>The Wall Street Journal</a></b></i> (also based in NYC, $2) is similarly well-respected and widely read. For a more casual but still informative format, <i><b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.usatoday.com/ target=_blank>USA Today</a></b></i> ($2) is published five days a week; it's the most widely circulated print newspaper in the country. Many hotels offer free copies of either the local paper or <i>USA Today</i>; ask at the front desk. Other widely read papers include the <i><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.latimes.com/ target=_blank>Los Angeles Times</a></i> (known for its West Coast coverage) and <i><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ target=_blank>The Washington Post</a></i> (with exemplary political reporting from the nation's capital). <i><b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.time.com/ target=_blank>Time</a></b></i> and <i><b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.newsweek.com/ target=_blank>Newsweek</a></b></i> are newsmagazines published weekly that offers more in-depth feature coverage. </p>\n <p>Major metropolitan areas also have a full suite of <b>broadcast television</b> stations; small cities might have only two or three local stations, especially if they're within broadcast range of a larger city. The major broadcast networks are <a rel=nofollow href=http://abc.go.com/ target=_blank>ABC</a>, <a rel=nofollow href=https://www.cbs.com/ target=_blank>CBS</a>, <a rel=nofollow href=https://www.nbc.com/ target=_blank>NBC</a>, <a rel=nofollow href=https://www.fox.com/ target=_blank>Fox</a>, and <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.pbs.com/ target=_blank>PBS</a> (taxpayer-subsidized public broadcasting); each has local stations in each market that broadcast local and national news, syndicated shows, and in-house TV series. Almost the entire country is wired for cable TV. That opens up a whole range of options for viewing, from <b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.cnn.com/ target=_blank>CNN</a></b> for news to <b><a rel=nofollow href=https://weather.com/ target=_blank>The Weather Channel</a></b> to <b><a rel=nofollow href=http://www.espn.com/ target=_blank>ESPN</a></b> for sports, along with countless entertainment channels. </p>\n <p><b>Broadcast radio</b> is a much more fragmented market than television; major cities have dozens of stations on both AM and FM bands. The AM band is mostly used for talk formats; music stations are almost exclusively found on the FM band. Many rental cars come equipped with <b>satellite radio</b> from <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.siriusxm.com/ target=_blank>SiriusXM</a>, which offers hundreds of channels of music, comedy, news, talk, and sports, without the need to keep finding new stations as you drive across the country. </p>\n <h2> <span>Respect</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/7pmQ51Sp1_7BPtR1AhYR6n3MVopVC6FSvIDAj4nX0Vlbox1eZtWkxDQ=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/NNbYXjewC6K3eP9545tFwMB19SBuN1OWdASyjYSWVvoOZ9dXPKuzXh_TyDA=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Burning_Man_2011_Victor_Grigas_The_man_IMG_4602_cropped.jpg/250px-Burning_Man_2011_Victor_Grigas_The_man_IMG_4602_cropped.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>Burning Man</span>, <span>Nevada</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The United States is a very diverse country, meaning that <b>cultural norms can vary significantly</b> from region to region, and it is difficult to generalize what could be offensive and what could not. For instance, while making homophobic statements would be very offensive in a liberal area like New York City, the opposite could be true in a strongly Evangelical rural town in the South. </p>\n <p>Also see the section on <span>tipping</span>, and the section on <span>smoking</span>. </p>\n <h3> <span>Dress</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p><span>Dress</span> in the U.S. tends to be fairly <b>casual</b>. For everyday clothes, jeans and T-shirts are always acceptable, as are shorts when the weather is suitable. Sneakers (athletic shoes) are common; flip-flops and sandals are also popular in warm weather. In the winter seasons in northern states boots are commonly worn. </p>\n <p>In general, dress code is a bit more formal in the metropolises of the Atlantic, and in the South (where \"Southern style\" is a surviving concept), and more relaxed the further west you go. </p>\n <p>Generally, Americans accept religious attire such as yarmulkes, hijabs and burqas without comment. </p>\n <p>At the workplace, <b>business casual</b> (slacks, understated collared shirts without a tie, and non-athletic shoes) is now the default at many companies. More traditional industries (e.g. finance, legal, and insurance) still require suits and ties. Other industries (e.g. computer software) are even more casual, allowing jeans and even shorts for everyday wear; as a business visitor, a safe choice would be business casual, or jeans and a collared shirt. </p>\n <p>When dressing up for nice restaurants or upscale entertainment, a pair of nice slacks, a collared shirt, and dress shoes will work almost everywhere. Ties for men are rarely necessary, but jackets are occasionally required for very upscale restaurants in big cities (such restaurants will almost always have jackets to lend). </p>\n <p>At the beach or pool, men prefer loose bathing trunks or boardshorts, and women wear bikinis or one-piece swimsuits. Nude bathing is not generally acceptable and is usually illegal except at certain private beaches or resorts; even women going topless is not usually accepted by most people, and is also illegal in some states. </p>\n <p><b>Breastfeeding in public</b> can be a touchy subject. While most mothers in the U.S. do breastfeed at home for at least a little while, a woman doing so in public, whether covered or not, can elicit complaints about indecent exposure, often from other mothers. All states/territories except Idaho and Puerto Rico have laws explicitly allowing women to breastfeed in public, and 29 states plus D.C. and the Virgin Islands also exempt breastfeeding from prosecution for public indecency or indecent exposure; some businesses have also changed their policies in the last few years to allow and protect breastfeeding mothers. However, public attitudes vary, and a mother breastfeeding in public, particularly uncovered, may receive some unwanted stares and in rare cases negative comments. </p>\n <h2> <span>Connect</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <h3> <span>By phone</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/r_WBjDt1Y-DXGK1fwHRYUO_gAUSF_eS82aI72PzubAeu7-u8DzXx_O0=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/PhIk_eJtR0MQmi7HWkkieyCS_qcWBs1clSEGXowVncdV8AAjhyIO-8IDNGs=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Phone_charging_station_at_Newark_airport.JPG/220px-Phone_charging_station_at_Newark_airport.JPG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Phone charging station at <span>Newark airport</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <h4> <span>Domestic calls</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>The <b>country code</b> for the U.S. is <b>+1</b>. The long-distance prefix (trunk code) is also \"1\", so U.S. telephone numbers are frequently written as an eleven-digit number: \"1-nnn-nnn-nnnn\". The rest of the telephone number consists of ten digits: a three-digit <b>area code</b>, and a seven-digit number. There can be many area codes in large cities, and only one or two for the entirety of a mostly rural state. The area code does not indicate whether a number is a mobile or a landline. Also, many Americans do not change their numbers when they move, so the area code of their mobile number may not match landlines in the region. </p>\n <p><b>From a mobile phone</b>, a domestic call is simple: always dial ten digits without the \"1\". </p>\n <p><b>From a fixed line</b>, you can usually dial a local number using ten digits. <span>New York City</span>, <span>Los Angeles</span>, <span>Chicago</span> and <span>San Francisco</span> require eleven digits. Regions with only one area code usually allow seven digits. If a number is written or given without the area code, you can usually dial it like that locally, but dialing ten digits also works. For long-distance and toll-free, always dial eleven digits. </p>\n <p>Domestic calls to area codes 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844 and 833 are <b>toll-free</b>. From a fixed line, they must be dialed using the full 11-digit pattern. With few exceptions (such as Canada or, rarely, Mexico) these are not reachable from abroad. (<span>VoIP</span> and Skype users may be able to circumvent this restriction by calling via a U.S.-based gateway.) </p>\n <h4> <span>International calls</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>To dial abroad from the U.S., the <b>international access code</b> is <b>011</b>. On a mobile phone, \"+\" will also work. </p>\n <p>Canada, U.S. territories, Bermuda, and 17 Caribbean nations are part of the <b>North American Numbering Plan</b>, and have the same +1 country code as the U.S. Calls made between these countries are dialed using only the full 11-digit number, without the \"011\" or \"+\" access code, but almost all are charged at international rates. Calls between the U.S. and its territories may be more expensive than calls within the contiguous 48 states and D.C., or even calls between the U.S. mainland and Canada (which are typically charged at a higher rate than domestic calls, but lower than other international calls). Alaska and Hawaii may carry a surcharge even for domestic calls, depending on the carrier and rate plan. </p>\n <h4> <span>Phones and directories</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p><b>Pay phones</b> can be hard to find. Likely locations include in or near stores and restaurants, shopping mall entrances and near bus stops. Most are coin operated (quarters, dimes and nickels) and do not accept banknotes. Prices are normally $0.50 for the first three minutes, and $0.25 for each additional minute. An online directory of pay phones can be found at <a rel=nofollow href=http://www.payphone-directory.org/ target=_blank>Pay Phone Directory</a>. Calls to 911 (to report an emergency) and to toll-free area codes (800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844 and 833) are free from pay phones. A few commercial toll-free numbers block inbound calls from U.S. payphones. </p>\n <p>Telephone directories are often split into two books: the <b>white pages</b> list phone numbers alphabetically by last name, and the <b>yellow pages</b> list businesses by category (e.g. \"Taxicabs\"). Many residential land-line phones and all mobile phones are unlisted. <b>Directory assistance</b> can be had (at an extra cost) by dialing <b>411</b> (for local numbers) or <b>1-<i>[area code]</i>-555-1212</b> (for other areas). If 411 doesn't work, try 555-1212, <i>[area code]</i>-555-1212 or 1-<i>[area code]</i>-555-1212. <b>Free directory information</b> (with advertisements) is available: dial 1-800-FREE-411 (1-800-3733-411) or browse <a rel=nofollow href=http://free411.com target=_blank>free411.com</a> or <a rel=nofollow href=http://411.info target=_blank>411.info</a>. Regional telephone companies' web sites (most often AT&amp;T, Verizon, or CenturyLink) also provide directory information. Using the website of the company that operates in the region you are interested in yields the best results. </p>\n <p>Long-distance telephone <b>calling cards</b> are available at most convenience stores. They are generally aimed at specific types of call (e.g. domestic, or to particular countries). Credit can often be replenished over the phone using a credit or debit card, but foreign bank cards may be refused. Card calls from payphones via toll-free numbers printed on the cards may be more expensive. There may also be effective charges per connection as well as per minute; some cards also carry hidden weekly or monthly charges which deplete their value. </p>\n <h4> <span>Mobile phones</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>The four largest mobile phone networks in the U.S. are <a rel=nofollow href=https://www.att.com/shop/wireless target=_blank>AT&amp;T</a>, <a rel=nofollow href=https://www.verizonwireless.com/ target=_blank>Verizon Wireless</a>, <a rel=nofollow href=https://www.sprint.com/ target=_blank>Sprint</a>, and <a rel=nofollow href=https://www.t-mobile.com/ target=_blank>T-Mobile</a>. These all have good coverage of practically all urban/suburban and many rural areas of the country, although each network has strong and weak areas. </p>\n <p>There is no surcharge for calling to a mobile phone (calls to mobile phones are charged the same as calls to land lines), and mobile phones don't pay surcharges when calling domestic long-distance. Instead, <b>mobile phones themselves are charged for all usage, outgoing and incoming</b>. In other words, a call to/from a mobile phone carries the same cost <i>to that mobile phone</i>, but it doesn't matter whether it's local, domestic long-distance, or toll-free. Credit packages from $25/month allow you to make hundreds of minutes' worth of calls. A failed call (or a \"missed call\") will be charged since you are billed from the moment you dial. </p>\n <p>If you want to have a mobile phone in the U.S. while you travel, you have several options: </p>\n <h3> <span>By mail</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/34fE3TF_S48CjLCYoKuySswUquVX6O8gP7_owPB6TM6HvprY23JkZYw=/wiki/United_States_of_America__-__/tunnel/6NfdXQS5zaRuI7MJzJ7OyZTK87UGUhB3BCTmAON0BZDDRzGKIxEM_DHcPtg=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Self_Service_center_at_US_Post_Office_in_Provo%2C_Utah.JPG/220px-Self_Service_center_at_US_Post_Office_in_Provo%2C_Utah.JPG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Self Service Postal Center</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Addressing mail with a properly-formatted address will expedite its journey with the <b><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.usps.com/ target=_blank>United States Postal Service</a></b> (USPS, not to be confused with the private shipper UPS). The <b>ZIP code</b> (postal code) is important, and you can <a rel=nofollow href=https://www.usps.com/zip4/ target=_blank>look up ZIP codes and correct address formats</a> online. A 5-digit ZIP code identifies a main post office; a 4-digit extension (recommended but optional) may narrow this to one business or an individual building. Addresses should be written in three to four lines with the name of recipient, house number and street name, suite or apartment or building number, city or town, two-letter state abbreviation, ZIP code, e.g.: </p>\n <blockquote><p>Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.<br>\n149 New Montgomery St.<br>\nSan Francisco, CA 94105-3739</p>\n</blockquote> <p>First-class international airmail postcards and letters (up to one ounce/28.5 grams) cost $1.15. All locations with a ZIP code are considered domestic, including the 50 states, U.S. possessions, <span>Micronesia (FSM)</span>, <span>Marshall Islands</span>, <span>Palau</span> and overseas military bases, ships (APO or FPO) and diplomatic posts (APO or DPO). Domestic postcards cost $0.35, and ordinary letters up to an ounce, $0.55 (2019). \"Forever\" stamps are available for the first ounce of domestic and international postage, and protect against future increases. Mailing thick or rigid objects, or non-standard shapes increases the postage cost. </p>\n <p><b>Poste Restante</b>, the receiving of mail at a post office rather than a private address, is called <b>General Delivery</b>. There is no charge for this service. You must show ID such as a passport to pick up your mail. Post offices will usually hold mail for up to 30 days. If the city is large enough to have multiple post offices, <b>only one</b> (usually in the center of downtown) will allow General Delivery. </p>\n <p>FedEx and UPS also have a \"Hold for Pickup\" option and have locations throughout larger cities in the U.S. Though usually more expensive, these may be a better option when receiving something important from abroad. </p>\n <h3> <span>By Internet</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>Given the ubiquity of private Internet access, Internet cafés are <i>rare</i> outside major cities and tourist areas. However, you do have some options, except perhaps in the most rural of areas. Accessible Wi-Fi networks, however, are common. </p>\n <h4> <span>Wireless</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p>The most generally useful Wi-Fi spots are in <b>coffee shops, fast-food chains, and bookshops</b>, though you may need to buy something first. Some cities also provide free Wi-Fi across their downtown areas. Try to use only public networks. Using a private network (even one without a password), unless authorized to do so, is illegal (though enforcement is nearly non-existent), and it may also allow criminals to track your browsing and so defraud you. Even traffic on public networks may be logged. </p>\n <p>A few less obvious Wi-Fi spots may be found in: </p>\n <p><b>Mobile broadband</b> via a USB modem is also an option. Service providers include Verizon Wireless and Virgin Mobile (which uses the Sprint network). Make sure to check a coverage map before you buy, each company has large areas with bad or no coverage. Also, these plans are subject to data limits which are easy to exceed unknowingly! Avoid watching videos over a mobile network. </p>\n <h4> <span>Public PC terminals</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h4> <p><b>Internet cafés</b> can still be found in some larger cities. Airports and shopping malls offer Internet access terminals for quick use, although these are generally disappearing. Access typically costs $1 for 1–2 minutes of web time.

When data is available, the languages spoken in each country are broken down according to the percent of the total population speaking each language as a first language. For those countries without available data, languages are listed in rank order based on prevalence, starting with the most-spoken language. </p>\n <p>This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents starting with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total population. The core characteristics and beliefs of the world's major religions are described below. Baha'i - Founded by Mirza Husayn-Ali (known as Baha'u'llah) in Iran in 1852, Baha'i faith emphasizes monotheism and believes in one eternal transcendent God.

Information is included by sex and age group as follows: 0-14 years (children), 15-24 years (early working age), 25-54 years (prime working age), 55-64 years (mature working age), 65 years and over (elderly). The age structure of a population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while countries with older population . . . </p>\n <p>Dependency ratios are a measure of the age structure of a population. They relate the number of individuals that are likely to be economically \"dependent\" on the support of others. Dependency ratios contrast the ratio of youths (ages 0-14) and the elderly (ages 65+) to the number of those in the working-age group (ages 15-64). Changes in the dependency ratio provide an indication of potential social support requirements resulting from changes in population age structures.

It is a single index that summarizes the age distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from a low of about 15 in Niger and Uganda to 40 or more in several European countries and Japan. See the entry for \"Age structure\" for the importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by implication, a low versus a high . . . </p>\n <p>The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can be seen as . . . </p>\n <p>This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility and the age structure of the population. </p>\n <p>This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all ages, as declining . . . </p>\n <p>This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall level of population chan . . . </p>\n <p>This entry provides a summary description of the population dispersion within a country. While it may suggest population density, it does not provide density figures. </p>\n <p>This entry provides two measures of the degree of urbanization of a population.

An urban agglomeration is defined as comprising th . . . </p>\n <p>This entry provides the population of the capital and up to six major cities defined as urban agglomerations with populations of at least 750,000 people. An urban agglomeration is defined as comprising the city or town proper and also the suburban fringe or thickly settled territory lying outside of, but adjacent to, the boundaries of the city. For smaller countries, lacking urban centers of 750,000 or more, only the population of the capital is presented. </p>\n <p>This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over, and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and fertilit . . . </p>\n <p>This entry provides the mean (average) age of mothers at the birth of their first child. It is a useful indicator for gauging the success of family planning programs aiming to reduce maternal mortality, increase contraceptive use – particularly among married and unmarried adolescents – delay age at first marriage, and improve the health of newborns. </p>\n <p>The maternal mortality rate (MMR) is the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes). The MMR includes deaths during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, for a specified year. </p>\n <p>This entry gives the number of deaths of infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births in the same year. This rate is often used as an indicator of the level of health in a country. </p>\n <p>This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in the future. Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human capital and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial measures. </p>\n <p>This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more direct measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential for population change in the country. A rate of two children per woman is considered the replaceme . . . </p>\n <p>This field gives the percent of women of reproductive age (15-49) who are married or in union and are using, or whose sexual partner is using, a method of contraception according to the date of the most recent available data.

Nations use different standards and procedures in collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys based on income will normally show a more unequal distribution than surveys based on consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with time, yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country comparisons. </p>\n <p>This index measures the degree of inequality in the distribution of family income in a country. The index is calculated from the Lorenz curve, in which cumulative family income is plotted against the number of families arranged from the poorest to the richest. The index is the ratio of (a) the area between a country's Lorenz curve and the 45 degree helping line to (b) the entire triangular area under the 45 degree line. The more nearly equal a country's income distribution, the closer its . . . </p>\n <p>This entry includes revenues, expenditures, and capital expenditures.
