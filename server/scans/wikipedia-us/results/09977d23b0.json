With a population of over 327 million people, the U.S. is the third most populous country. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York City. Most of the country is located contiguously in North America between Canada and Mexico. \n Paleo-Indiansmigrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago.European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Following the French and Indian War, numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775, and the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories,displacing Native American tribes, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848.\n During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery. By the end of the century, the United States had reached the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Sweeping civil rights legislation passed under President Lyndon B. Johnson, notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, outlawed discrimination based on race or color and established the country as a full liberal democracy. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the 1969 U.S. Moon landing. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.\n The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a federal republic and a representative democracy. The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The U.S. economy is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world.[30] The United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter of goods, by value.[31] Although its population is only 4.3% of the world total,[33] the U.S. holds 31% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country.[34]\n Despite income and wealth disparities, the United States continues to rank very high in measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, median income (both before and after taxes and transfers), human development, per capita GDP, and worker productivity.[35][36] The United States is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending,[37] and is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[38]\n Contents\n\n Etymology See also: Naming of the Americas, Names for United States citizens, and American (word) \n  The Americas are believed to be named for the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci.[39] \n \n\n In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere America in honor of the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin: Americus Vespucius).[40] The first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., to George Washington's aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army, Lt. Col. Joseph Reed. Moylan expressed his wish to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort.[41][43] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[44]\n The second draft of the Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared \"The name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America'\".[45] The final version of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence \"The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'\".[46] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his \"original Rough draught\" of the Declaration of Independence.[45] This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.[45]\n The short form \"United States\" is also standard. Other common forms are the \"U.S.\", the \"USA\", and \"America\". Colloquial names are the \"U.S. of A.\" and, internationally, the \"States\". \"Columbia\", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the name \"District of Columbia\", many landmarks and institutions in the Western Hemisphere bear his name, including the country of Colombia.[47]\n The phrase \"United States\" was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., \"the United States are\"—including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865.[48] The singular form—e.g., \"the United States is\"—became popular after the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom \"these United States\". The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.[49]\n A citizen of the United States is an \"American\". \"United States\", \"American\" and \"U.S.\" refer to the country adjectivally (\"American values\", \"U.S. forces\"). In English, the word \"American\" rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States.[50]\n History Main articles: History of the United States, Timeline of United States history, American business history, Economic history of the United States, and Labor history of the United States \n Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history Further information: Native Americans in the United States \n   \n  Monks Mound, in Cahokia, a UNESCOWorld Heritage Site \n \n  \n The Cliff Palace, built by the Ancestral Puebloans \n \n \n\n\n It has been generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[51] After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward along the Pacific coast[53] and through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets.[54] The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas.[55] The Clovis culture was believed to represent the first human settlement of the Americas.[56] Over the years, more and more evidence has advanced the idea of \"pre-Clovis\" cultures including tools dating back about 15,550 years ago. It is likely these represent the first of three major waves of migrations into North America.[57]\n Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-ColumbianMississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies.[58] The Mississippian culture flourished in the south from 800 to 1600 AD, extending from the Mexican border down through Florida.[59] Its city state Cahokia is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States.[60] In the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloans culture developed as the culmination of centuries of agricultural experimentation, which produced greater dependence on farming.[61] Three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United States are credited to the Pueblos: Mesa Verde National Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, and Taos Pueblo.[63] The earthworks constructed by Native Americans of the Poverty Point culture in northeastern Louisiana have also been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.[64]\n The date of the first settlements of the Hawaiian Islands is a topic of continuing debate.[65]Archaeological evidence seems to indicate a settlement as early as 124 AD.[66]\n Effects on and interaction with native populations Further information: American Indian Wars, Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas, and Native American disease and epidemics \n With the progress of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced.[67] The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles.[68][69]\n While estimating the original native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult, an attempt was made in the early part of the twentieth century by James Mooney using historic records to estimate the indigenous population north of Mexico in 1600.[70][71] In more recent years, Douglas H. Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution has updated these figures. While Ubelaker estimated that there was a population of 92,916 in the south Atlantic states and a population of 473,616 in the Gulf states, most academics regard the figure as too low.[70]AnthropologistHenry F. Dobyns believed that the populations were much higher, suggesting 1,100,000 along the shores of the gulf of Mexico, 2,211,000 people living between Florida and Massachusetts, 5,250,000 in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries and 697,000 people in the Florida peninsula.[70][71]\n The first interaction between Europeans and Native Americans was made by the Norsemen. A number of surviving Norse sagas provide information regarding The Maritimes and its indigenous people. The Norse attempted to settle in North America about 500 years before Columbus.[73][74][75]\n In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.[76] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans, and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.[77][78]\n European settlements Further information: Colonial history of the United States, European colonization of the Americas, and Thirteen Colonies \n   St. Augustine, Florida, the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States (1565)[79] \n \n\n   The Mayflower Compact, 1620 by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris \n \n\n With the advancement of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced.[80] The first Europeans to arrive in the territory of the modern United States were Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made his first visit to Florida in 1513; however, if unincorporated territories are accounted for, then credit would go to Christopher Columbus who landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage. The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine[79] and Santa Fe. The French established their own as well along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims'Plymouth Colony in 1620. Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[81]\n Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice, and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period, Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply.[83] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.[84]\n A large-scale slave trade with English privateers was begun.[85] The life expectancy of slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves.[86][87] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.[88][89] But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.[90]\n With the British colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America were established.[91] All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism. With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.[93] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.[94]\n  The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748\n \n\n During the Seven Years' War (in the United States, known as the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[95] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.[96]\n In 1774, the Spanish Navy ship Santiago, under Juan Pérez, entered and anchored in an inlet of Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, in present-day British Columbia. Although the Spanish did not land, natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from California.[97] At the time, the Spanish were able to monopolize the trade between Asia and North America, granting limited licenses to the Portuguese. When the Russians began establishing a growing fur trading system in Alaska, the Spanish began to challenge the Russians, with Pérez's voyage being the first of many to the Pacific Northwest.[98][j]\n During his third and final voyage, Captain James Cook became the first European to begin formal contact with Hawaii.[100] Captain Cook's last voyage included sailing along the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months.[101]\n Independence and expansion (1776–1865) Further information: American Revolutionary War, United States Declaration of Independence, American Revolution, and Territorial evolution of the United States \n   Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull \n \n\n The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of \"republicanism\" asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen and \"no taxation without representation\". The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.\n The Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, which recognized, in a long preamble, that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great Britain, and declared, in the words of the resolution, that the thirteen United Colonies formed an independent nation and had no further allegiance to the British crown. The fourth day of July is celebrated annually as Independence Day.[103] The Second Continental Congress declared on September 9 \"where, heretofore, the words 'United Colonies' have been used, the stile be altered for the future to the 'United States' \".[104] In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789.[103]\n   U.S. territorial acquisitions–portions of each territory were granted statehood since the 18th century.\n \n\n Following the defeat at Yorktown in 1781,[105] Britain signed the peace treaty of 1783, and American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[106]\n Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population.[107][108][109] The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[110] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[111]\n  Map of the states and territories of the United States, c. 1834\n \n\n Americans' eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's area.[113] The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism.[114] A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[115] The expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&amp;M; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.[116]\n From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider white male suffrage; it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny.[117] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[118] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[119]\n  The national mammal, an American bison in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming\n \n\n The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration, the California Genocide and the creation of additional western states. After the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, the loss of the American bison (sometimes called \"buffalo\") was an existential blow to many Plains Indians culture. In 1869, a new Peace Policy nominally promised to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship. Nonetheless, large-scale conflicts continued throughout the West into the 1900s. \n Civil War and Reconstruction era Further information: American Civil War and Reconstruction era \n   The Battle of Gettysburg by Thure de Thulstrup \n \n\n Differences of opinion regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union had alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.\n With the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the \"South\"), while the federal government (the \"Union\") maintained that secession was illegal. In order to bring about this secession, military action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind. The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians. The South fought for the freedom to own slaves, while the Union at first simply fought to maintain the country as one united whole. Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibited slavery. \n Three amendments were added to the U.S. Constitution in the years after the war: the aforementioned Thirteenth as well as the Fourteenth Amendment providing citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,[130] and the Fifteenth Amendment ensuring in theory that African Americans had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power[131] aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the South while guaranteeing the rights of the newly freed slaves. \n Reconstruction began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, an assassin's bullet on April 14, 1865, drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the Compromise of 1877 when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the presidential election of 1876. \n Southern white Democrats, calling themselves \"Redeemers\", took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction. From 1890 to 1910, so-called Jim Crow lawsdisenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region. Blacks faced racial segregation, especially in the South. They also occasionally experienced vigilante violence, including lynching.[133]\n   Ellis Island, in New York City, was a major gateway for European immigration.[134] \n \n\n  The Statue of Liberty in New York City, dedicated in 1886, is a symbol of the United States as well as its ideals of freedom, democracy, and justice.[135] \n \n\n Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization Main articles: Economic history of the United States and Technological and industrial history of the United States \n In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture.[136] National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.[137]\n The United States fought Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River from 1810 to at least 1890.[138] Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and the confinement of the latter to Indian reservations. This further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets.[139] Mainland expansion also included the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[140] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War.[141]American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War. The United States purchased the U.S. Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917.[143]\n Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest, and the United States achieved great power status.[144] These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[145] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.[146][147][148]\n World War I, Great Depression, and World War II Further information: World War I, Great Depression, and World War II \n  The Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world when completed in 1931, during the Great Depression.\n \n\n The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until 1917, when it joined the war as an \"associated power\", alongside the formal Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[149]\n In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage.[150] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television.[151] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system. The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s;[153] whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[154]\n At first effectively neutral during World War II while Germany conquered much of continental Europe, the United States began supplying material to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers.[155] Although Japan attacked the United States first, the U.S. nonetheless pursued a \"Europe first\" defense policy.[156] The United States thus left its vast Asian colony, the Philippines, isolated and fighting a losing struggle against Japanese invasion and occupation, as military resources were devoted to the European theater. During the war, the United States was referred to as one of the \"Four Policemen\"[157] of Allies power who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union and China.[158][159] Although the nation lost around 400,000 military personnel,[160] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[161]\n  The Trinity test of the Manhattan Project was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon \n \n\n The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences with the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and other Allies, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe's postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war. The United States and Japan then fought each other in the largest naval battle in history in terms of gross tonnage sunk, the Battle of Leyte Gulf.[163][164] The United States eventually developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; causing the Japanese to surrender on September 2, ending World War II.[165][166] Parades and celebrations followed in what is known as Victory Day, or V-J Day.[167]\n Cold War and civil rights era Main articles: History of the United States (1945–1964), History of the United States (1964–1980), and History of the United States (1980–1991) \n Further information: Cold War, Civil Rights Movement, War on Poverty, Space Race, and Reaganomics \n   Martin Luther King, Jr. speaking to an anti-Vietnam War rally at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul on April 27, 1967\n \n\n  U.S. president Ronald Reagan (left) and Soviet general secretaryMikhail Gorbachev, meeting in Geneva in 1985\n \n\n After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what became known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism[168] and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict. \n The United States often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored, and occasionally pursued direct action for regime change against left-wing governments.[169] American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–53.[170] The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a \"Space Race\" in which the United States became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969.[170] A proxy war in Southeast Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War. \n At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[171] In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state added to the country.[173] The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination.[174][175][176] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution. \n The launch of a \"War on Poverty\" expanded entitlements and welfare spending, including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that provide health coverage to the elderly and poor, respectively, and the means-testedFood Stamp Program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.[177]\n The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned \"containment\" and initiated the more aggressive \"rollback\" strategy towards the USSR.[178][179][180][181] After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[183]\n The late 1980s brought a \"thaw\" in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.[184][185][186][187] This brought about unipolarity[188] with the U.S. unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower. The concept of Pax Americana, which had appeared in the post-World War II period, gained wide popularity as a term for the post-Cold War new world order.\n Contemporary history Main articles: History of the United States (1991–2008) and History of the United States (2008–present) \n Further information: Gulf War, September 11 attacks, War on Terror, 2008 financial crisis, and Affordable Care Act \n   \n The World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan during the September 11terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda in 2001\n \n  \n  One World Trade Center, newly built in its place\n \n \n\n\n After the Cold War, the conflict in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Saddam Husseininvaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H. W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.[189]\n Originating in U.S. defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic networks, and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the global economy, society, and culture.[190]\n Due to the dot-com boom, stable monetary policy under Alan Greenspan, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.[191] Beginning in 1994, the U.S. entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade among the three partners has soared since NAFTA went into force.\n On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[193] In response, the United States launched the War on Terror, which included war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.[194][195] In 2007, the Bush administration ordered a major troop surge in the Iraq War,[196] which successfully reduced violence and led to greater stability in the region.[197][198]\n Government policy designed to promote affordable housing,[199] widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation's history since the Great Depression.Barack Obama, the first African-American and multiracial president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements and a relative decline in unemployment. Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there has been debate about its effects on the economy.\n American forces in Iraq were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and the war in the region was declared formally over in December 2011. The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency, leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region. In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time since 1961.[needs update] The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran's nuclear program, though the U.S. withdrew from the deal in May 2018. In the United States presidential election of 2016, Republican Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States. Trump is both the oldest and wealthiest person elected president in United States history.\n Geography, climate, and environment Main articles: Geography of the United States, Climate of the United States, and Environment of the United States \n  A composite satellite image of the contiguous United States and surrounding areas\n \n\n  Köppen climate classifications\n \n\n The land area of the entire United States is approximately 3,800,000 square miles (9,841,955 km2), with the contiguous United States making up 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940.6 km2) of that. Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856.2 km2). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. The populated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2). Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.\n The United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured.[d] The Encyclopædia Britannica, for instance, lists the size of the United States as 3,677,649 square miles (9,525,067 km2), as they do not count the country's coastal or territorial waters.The World Factbook, which includes those waters, gives 3,796,742 square miles (9,833,517 km2).\n The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont. The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest. The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.\n  Highest peak in the country, Denali \n \n\n The Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado. Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave. The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California, and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart. At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali (Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and North America. Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature. The United States has the most ecoregions out of any country in the world.\n The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.\n Wildlife Main articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States \n See also: Category:Biota of the United States \n  The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782.\n \n\n The U.S. ecology is megadiverse: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland. The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species. About 91,000 insect species have been described. The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself.\n There are 59 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas. Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country's land area. Most of this is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; about .86% is used for military purposes.\n Environmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and international responses to global warming. Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n Demographics Main articles: Americans, Demography of the United States, and Race and ethnicity in the United States \n Population See also: List of U.S. states by population and List of United States cities by population \n  Historical population   Census Pop. %±   1790 3,929,214  —   1800 5,308,483  35.1%   1810 7,239,881  36.4%    9,638,453  33.1%   1830 12,866,020  33.5%   1840 17,069,453  32.7%   1850 23,191,876  35.9%   1860 31,443,321  35.6%   1870 38,558,371  22.6%   1880 50,189,209  30.2%   1890 62,979,766  25.5%   1900 76,212,168  21.0%   1910 92,228,496  21.0%    106,021,537  15.0%   1930 123,202,624  16.2%   1940 132,164,569  7.3%   1950 151,325,798  14.5%   1960 179,323,175  18.5%   1970 203,211,926  13.3%   1980 226,545,805  11.5%   1990 248,709,873  9.8%    281,421,906  13.2%    308,745,538  9.7%   Est. 2018[9] 327,167,434  6.0%  1610–1780 population data.\nNote that the census numbers do\nnot include Native Americans until 1860.  The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the country's population to be 327,167,434 as of July 1, 2018, and to be adding 1 person (net gain) every 13 seconds, or about 6,646 people per day.[33] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from 76.2 million in 1900 to 281.4 million in 2000. The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected. In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children; by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56. Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.76 children per woman in 2017. Foreign-born immigration has caused the U.S. population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign-born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 45 million in 2015, representing one-third of the population increase. In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants (second-generation Americans) in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population. The United States has a very diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.German Americans are the largest ethnic group (more than 50 million) – followed by Irish Americans (circa 37 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans (circa 28 million).\n White Americans (mostly European ancestry group with 73.1% of total population) are the largest racial group; black Americans are the nation's largest racial minority (note that in the U.S. Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans are counted as an ethnic group, not a \"racial\" group), and third-largest ancestry group.Asian Americans are the country's second-largest racial minority; the three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans. According to a 2015 survey, the largest American community with European ancestry is German Americans, which consists of more than 14% of the total population. In 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively). The census counted more than 19 million people of \"Some Other Race\" who were \"unable to identify with any\" of its five official race categories in 2010, over 18.5 million (97%) of whom are of Hispanic ethnicity.\n  Most common ancestry in each U.S. state in 2000\nGermanAmericanMexicanIrishAfricanItalianEnglishJapanesePuerto Rican \n \n\n The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend. The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent are identified as sharing a distinct \"ethnicity\" by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent. Between 2000 and 2010, the country's Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%. Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[k]\n The drop in the U.S. fertility rate from 2.08 per woman in 2007 to 1.76 in 2017 was mostly due to the declining birth rate of Hispanics, teenagers, and young women, although the birth rate for older women rose, below the replacement rate of 2.1. In 2018 the median age of the United States population was 38.1 years.\n Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 37.2% of the population in 2012 and over 50% of children under age one, and are projected to constitute the majority by 2044.\n The United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world average. Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher than that of many developed nations. In fiscal year 2017, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.Mexico has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries since the 1990s. As of 2012, approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal immigrants. As of 2015, 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing. The estimated number of illegal immigrants dropped to 10.7 million in 2017, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. In 2017, 33,000 refugees were resettled in the United States. This was fewer than were resettled in the rest of the world for the first time in decades. A 2017 Gallup poll concluded that 4.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT with 5.1% of women identifying as LGBT, compared with 3.9% of men. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%.\n Major population areas The U.S. Census Bureau numerically ranks population areas by city, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), and larger combined statistical areas (CSAs). \n About 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs); about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston). There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million. Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South. The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008.\n In addition to official census groupings based on the aforementioned city, MSA and CSA level, clusters of American cities can also be known as megaregions: the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. \n Language Main article: Languages of the United States \n See also: Language Spoken at Home in the United States of America, List of endangered languages in the United States, and Language education in the United States \n English (American English) is the de factonational language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in 32 states.\n Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state law.Alaska recognizes twenty Native languages as well as English. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms.\n Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan[300] is officially recognized by American Samoa. Chamorro[301] is an official language of Guam. Both Carolinian and Chamorro have official recognition in the Northern Mariana Islands. Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there.[303]\n The most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate education, are: Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners) include Latin, Japanese, ASL, Italian, and Chinese.[304][305] 18% of all Americans claim to speak at least one language in addition to English.[306]\n  Languages spoken at home by more than 1 million persons in the U.S. (2016)[307][308][l]    Language Percent of\npopulation Number of\nspeakers Number who\nspeak English\nvery well Number who\nspeak English\nless than\nvery well     English(only)  ~80% 237,810,023 N/A N/A     Spanish\n(including Spanish Creole but excluding Puerto Rico)  13% 40,489,813 23,899,421 16,590,392     Chinese\n(all varieties, including Mandarin and Cantonese)  1.0% 3,372,930 1,518,619 1,854,311     Tagalog\n(including Filipino)  0.5% 1,701,960 1,159,211 542,749    Vietnamese 0.4% 1,509,993 634,273 875,720     Arabic\n(all varieties)  0.3% 1,231,098 770,882 460,216     French\n(including Patois and Cajun)  0.3% 1,216,668 965,584 251,087    Korean 0.2% 1,088,788 505,734 583,054     Religion Main article: Religion in the United States \n  Religious affiliation in the U.S. (2014)[309]    Affiliation  % of U.S. population    Christianity 70.6    Protestant 46.5    Evangelical Protestant 25.4    Mainline Protestant 14.7    Black church 6.5    Catholic 20.8    Mormon 1.6    Jehovah's Witnesses 0.8    Eastern Orthodox 0.5    Other Christian  0.4    Judaism 1.9    Hinduism 1.2    Islam 0.9    Buddhism 0.9    Other faiths  1.8    Irreligion 22.8    Nothing in particular  15.8    Agnostic 4.0    Atheist 3.1    Don't know or refused answer  0.6     The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment. \n In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a \"very important role in their lives\", a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.[310] In a 2009 Gallup poll, 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.[311]\n As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30. Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion has been declining since the mid to late 1980s,[313] and that younger Americans, in particular, are becoming increasingly irreligious.[309][314] According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time.[315][316] Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.[317]\n According to a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults in the United States identified themselves as Christians;[318]Protestants accounted for 46.5%, while Roman Catholics, at 20.8%, formed the largest single denomination.[319] In 2014, 5.9% of the U.S. adult population claimed a non-Christian religion.[309] These include Judaism (1.9%), Hinduism (1.2%), Buddhism (0.9%), and Islam (0.9%).[309] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion—up from 8.2% in 1990.[319] There are also Unitarian Universalist, Scientologist, Baha'i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Satanist, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.\n Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States, accounting for almost half of all Americans. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism at 15.4%, and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination at 5.3% of the U.S. population. Apart from Baptists, other Protestant categories include nondenominational Protestants, Methodists, Pentecostals, unspecified Protestants, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, other Reformed, Episcopalians/Anglicans, Quakers, Adventists, Holiness, Christian fundamentalists, Anabaptists, Pietists, and multiple others. Two-thirds of American Protestants consider themselves to be born again.Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin primarily in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas, as well as in the English colony of Maryland. It later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island has the highest percentage of Catholics, with 40 percent of the total population.Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.Eastern Orthodoxy is claimed by 5% of people in Alaska, a former Russian colony, and maintains a presence on the U.S. mainland due to recent immigration from Eastern Europe. Finally, a number of other Christian groups are active across the country, including the Oneness Pentecostals, Jehovah's Witnesses, Restorationists, Churches of Christ, Christian Scientists, Unitarians and many others. \n The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.[311]\n Family structure Main article: Family structure in the United States \n As of 2007, 58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 25% had never been married. Women now work mostly outside the home and receive a majority of bachelor's degrees.[330]\n The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991.[331] In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, and the lowest in Wyoming.[331]Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[333] In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.[334]\n The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2016 was 1.82 births per 1000 woman.[335]Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).[336] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[337]Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide, owing to the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, and it is legal for same-sex couples to adopt.Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[338]\n Health See also: Health care in the United States, Health care reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States \n  View of the Texas Medical Center from Fannin Street. The center is the largest medical complex in the world.\n \n\n The United States had a life expectancy of 78.6 years at birth in 2017, which was the third year of declines in life expectancy following decades of continuous increase. The recent decline is largely due to sharp increases in the drug overdose and suicide rates. Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among blacks.[339][340] According to CDC and Census Bureau data, deaths from suicide, alcohol and drug overdoses hit record highs in 2017.[341]\n Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 11th in the world in 1987, to 42nd in 2007. Obesity rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years, are the highest in the industrialized world, and are among the highest anywhere.[343][344] Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight.[345] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.[346]\n In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[347] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[348]\n The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the European Union and Switzerland together contributed to five.[349] Since 1966, more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.[350] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.[351]\n Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2017, 12.2% of the population did not carry health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[353][354] In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[355]Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014,[needs update] though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.[356][357]\n Education Main article: Education in the United States \n  The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of the many public universities in the United States. Universal government-funded education exists in the United States, while there are also many privately funded institutions.\n \n\n American public education is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[358]\n About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarianprivate schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[359] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student.[360] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[361]\n Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees. The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.[363] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[364]\n Higher education Main article: Higher education in the United States \n The United States has many competitive private and public institutions of higher education. The majority of the world's top universities listed by different ranking organizations are in the U.S.[365][366][367] There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[citation needed]\n As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[360][369] As of 2018, student loan debt exceeded 1.5 trillion dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards.[370][371]\n Government and politics Main articles: Federal government of the United States, Politics of the United States, State governments of the United States, and Local government in the United States \n   \n The United States Capitol,\nwhere Congress meets:\nthe Senate, left; the House, right\n \n\n  \n The White House, home and workplace of the U.S. President \n \n\n  \n  Supreme Court Building, where the nation's highest court sits\n \n\n \n\n The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a representative democracy, \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law\". The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.[373] For 2018, the U.S. ranked 25th on the Democracy Index[374] and 22nd on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[375]\n In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is rare at lower levels.[376]\n The federal government comprises three branches: \n The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census, seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, had 53.[381] The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories each have one member of Congress — these members are not allowed to vote.\n The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one-third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories do not have senators. The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The president is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[383] The Supreme Court, led by the chief justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[384]\n The state governments are structured in a roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature.[385] The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote. \n The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the \"great writ\" of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[386] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[387] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[388]\n Political divisions Main articles: Political divisions of the United States, U.S. state, Territories of the United States, List of states and territories of the United States, and Indian reservation \n Further information: Territorial evolution of the United States and United States territorial acquisitions \n  Map of U.S. Economic Exclusion Zone,[389] highlighting states, territories and possessions\n \n\n The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[390][391] The states and territories are the principal administrative districts in the country. These are divided into subdivisions of counties and independent cities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C.[393] The states and the District of Columbia choose the president of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their representatives and senators in Congress; the District of Columbia has three (because of the 23rd Amendment).[394]Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico do not have presidential electors, and so people in those territories cannot vote for the president.\n Congressional Districts are reapportioned among the states following each decennial Census of Population. Each state then draws single-member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The total number of voting representatives is 435. There are also 6 non-voting representatives who represent the District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories.[395]\n The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they have a great deal of autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.[396]\n Citizenship is granted at birth in all states, the District of Columbia, and all major U.S. territories except American Samoa.[397][398]\n  State flags and statehood dates\n  (listed alphabetically)\n \n\n   (listed chronologically)\n \n\n   Statehood date is the date of ratifying the Constitution (for the first 13)or being admitted to the Union (for subsequent states) \n \n  Territory and district flags and dates\n  (listed alphabetically)\n \n\n   (listed chronologically)\n \n\n  Territory date is the date the territory was acquired by the United States, except for the District of Columbia, which was founded separately\n \n Parties and elections Main articles: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, and Political ideologies in the United States \n  Congressional leadership meeting with President Obama in 2011.[399] \n \n\n   \n  Donald Trump\n45th President\nsince January 20, 2017 \n \n  \n  Mike Pence\n48th Vice President\nsince January 20, 2017 \n \n \n\n\n In American political culture, the center-right Republican Party is considered \"conservative\" and the center-left Democratic Party is considered \"liberal\".[403] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as \"blue states\", are relatively liberal. The \"red states\" of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative. \n RepublicanDonald Trump, the winner of the 2016 presidential election, is serving as the 45th president of the United States.[404] Leadership in the Senate includes Republican vice president Mike Pence, Republican president pro tempore Chuck Grassley, Majority LeaderMitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.[405] Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Majority LeaderSteny Hoyer, and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.[406]\n In the 116th United States Congress, the House of Representatives is controlled by the Democratic Party and the Senate is controlled by the Republican Party, giving the U.S. a split Congress. The Senate consists of 53 Republicans, and 45 Democrats with 2 Independents who caucus with the Democrats; the House consists of 235 Democrats and 199 Republicans.[407] In state governorships, there are 27 Republicans and 23 Democrats.[408] Among the D.C. mayor and the 5 territorial governors, there are 2 Republicans, 1 Democrat, 1 New Progressive, and 2 Independents.[409][410]\n Foreign relations Main articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States \n  The United Nations Headquarters was built in Midtown Manhattan in 1952.[411] \n \n\n The United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[414] and strong ties with Canada,[415]Australia,[416]New Zealand,[417]the Philippines,[418]Japan,[419]South Korea,Israel, and several European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance, the most in the world. As a share of America's large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast, private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.Colombia is traditionally considered by the United States as its most loyal ally in South America. Policymakers in both countries consider Plan Colombia to be a foreign policy success for the United States.\n The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau. These are Pacific island nations, once part of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands after World War II, which gained independence in subsequent years.\n On October 25, 2017, Vice President Mike Pence announced at a In Defense of Christians annual dinner meeting in Washington that the United States would stop funding United Nations relief efforts, cases tackling the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, but insisted that the U.S. would instead help and aid Christians directly through the United States Agency for International Development. Pence said that he will be visiting the Middle East in December and will meet with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to discuss peace agreements.\n Government finance See also: Taxation in the United States and United States federal budget \n  U.S. federal debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, from 1790 to 2013.[430] \n \n\n \n  United States debt from 1940 to 2015.\n \n\n Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state, and local government levels. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. Taxation in the United States is based on citizenship, not residency.[431] Both non-resident citizens and Green Card holders living abroad are taxed on their income irrespective of where they live or where their income is earned. It is the only country in the world, other than Eritrea, to do so.\n In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[433] During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%).[434] Based on CBO estimates,[435] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.[436]\n U.S. taxation has historically been generally progressive, especially the federal income taxes, though by most measures it became noticeably less progressive after 1980.[437][438] It has sometimes been described as among the most progressive in the developed world, but this characterization is controversial.[439][440][441][438] The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes,[443] and about half of all taxes.[444] Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[445][446] The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[447][448] However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.[449]\n The top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes.[450] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile.[451] The incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades.[453] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.[454]\n During FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare &amp; Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).[434]\n The total national debt of the United States in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP) in 2014.[455][m] The United States has the largest external debt in the world[460] and the 14th largest government debt as a % of GDP in the world.[citation needed]\n Military Main article: United States Armed Forces \n  The carrier strike groups of the Kitty Hawk, Ronald Reagan, and Abraham Lincoln with aircraft from the Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force.\n \n\n The president is the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[461]\n Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System. American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad,[463] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[464]\n The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[465] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA.[466] Defense spending plays a major role in science and technology investment, with roughly half of U.S. federal research and development funded by the Department of Defense.[467] Defense's share of the overall U.S. economy has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.[468]\n  US global military presence.\n \n\n The proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.[469] The last American troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011;[470] 4,484 service members were killed during the Iraq War.[471] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012; by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan.[473]\n The country is one of the five recognizednuclear weapons states and possesses the second largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world.[474] More than 90% of world's 14,000 nuclear weapons are owned by Russia and the United States.[475]\n Law enforcement and crime Main articles: Law enforcement in the United States and Crime in the United States \n See also: Law of the United States, Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, Human rights in the United States § Justice system, Incarceration in the United States, and Capital punishment in the United States \n  Law enforcement in the U.S. is maintained primarily by local police departments. The New York Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country.\n \n\n Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police departments and sheriff's offices, with state police providing broader services. The New York Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[476] At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.[477]\n In 2015, there were 15,696 murders which was 1,532 more than in 2014, a 10.8% increase, the largest since 1971.[478] The murder rate in 2015 was 4.9 per 100,000 people.[479] In 2016 the murder rate increased by 8.6%, with 17,413 murders that year.[480] The national clearance rate for homicides in 2015 was 64.1%, compared to 90% in 1965.[481] In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980. In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other developed nations.[483] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States \"homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.\"[484]Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject of contentious political debate. In 2016, the US murder rate of 5.4 per 100,000 was similar to the estimated global average of 5.15 per 100,000.[485]\n In 2017, there were 17,264 murders and the murder rate was 5.3 per 100,000. Regarding weapons, 73% of murders were committed by firearm, 10% by knife and 17% by other means.[486] The violent crime rose sharply in the 1960s until the early 1990s and declined in the late 1990s and 2000s.[486] In 2014, the murder rate fell to the lowest level (4.5) since 1957 (4.0).[487] The violent crime rate increased by 5.9% between 2014 and 2017 and the murder rate by 20.5%. Of those arrested for serious violent crimes in 2017, 58.5% were white, 37.5% were black, 2.1% were American Indian or Alaska Native and 1.5% Asian. Ethnically, 23.5% were Hispanic and 76.5% were non-Hispanic.[488] Gun violence peaked in 1993 with 17,125 gun murders before declining to 9,527 in 1999 and steadily rising since to 12,772. Non-gun murders reached a peak in 1980 of 8,340 and declined in most years until the early 2010s with 4,668 in 2017.[489] The rate of robberies declined 62% between 1990 and 2017.[486]\n From 1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of homicide victims and 90% of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites (\"whites\" includes most Hispanics), and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims killed by whites.[490] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.[491] The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes.\n Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and also at the state level in 30 states.[493][494] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976 the Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.[495] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death-penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.[496]\n  Total incarceration in the United States by year\n \n\n The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and largest prison population in the world.[497] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults.[498] In December 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision in December 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997.[499] The prison population has quadrupled since 1980,[500] and state and local spending on prisons and jails has grown three times as much as that spent on public education during the same period.[501] However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013 and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012.[503] The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies.[504] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[505] The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been a subject of debate.[506][507] In 2018, Oklahoma had the highest incarceration rate (1,079 per 100,000 people), and Massachusetts the lowest (324 per 100,000 people).[508][509] Among the U.S. territories, the highest incarceration rate was in the U.S. Virgin Islands (542 per 100,000 people) and the lowest was in Puerto Rico (313 per 100,000 people).[510][511]\n Economy Main article: Economy of the United States \n See also: Economic history of the United States \n  Economic indicators   Nominal GDP  $20.66 trillion (Q3 2018)     Real GDP growth 3.5% (Q3 2018)      2.1% (2017)      CPI inflation 2.2% (November 2018)  [513]   Employment-to-population ratio 60.6% (November 2018)  [514]   Unemployment 3.7% (November 2018)  [515]    Labor force participation rate 62.9% (November 2018)  [516]   Total public debt $21.85 trillion (November 2018)  [517]   Household net worth $109.0 trillion (Q3 2018)  [518]   The United States has a capitalistmixed economy[citation needed] which is fueled by abundant natural resources and high productivity.[519] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).\n The nominal GDP of the U.S. is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014. From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7. The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita according to the United Nations (first in the Americas) and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP. The U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.\n The United States is the largest importer of goods and second-largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners. In 2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the country's largest export. Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt. The largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve, who hold the majority of the debt.[530][531][n]\n  The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street, by a significant margin the world's largest stock exchange per market capitalization of its listed companies,[534][535] at US$23.1 trillion as of April 2018.[536] \n \n\n In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%.[537] The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1.[538] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power.[539] The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing.[540] In the franchising business model, McDonald's and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the world.[541]\n Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field. The United States is the largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its second-largest importer.[543] It is the world's number one producer of nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The National Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium, copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, titanium and others.[544][545]\n Agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP,[539] yet the United States is the world's top producer of corn[546] and soybeans.[547] The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food, representing half of the world's biotech crops.[548] In the contiguous 48 states, 35% of the land is used as pasture, 28% is covered by forest, and 21% is agricultural cropland, with all other uses accounting for less than 20%.[549]\n  A tract housing development in San Jose, California \n \n\n Consumer spending comprises 68% of the U.S. economy in 2015.[550] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe.[551] The United States has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000. The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers.[553] The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to.[554]\n The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation[555] and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia.[556] While federal law does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations.[557] 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits.[557] In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.[558]\n The 2008–2012 global recession significantly affected the United States, with output still below potential according to the Congressional Budget Office.[559] It brought high unemployment (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising petroleum and food prices. \n Science and technology Main articles: Science and technology in the United States and Science policy of the United States \n  Astronaut James Irwin walking on the Moon next to Apollo 15's landing module and lunar rover in 1971\n \n\n The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor-saving techniques created the system called mass production.[560]\n In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's research laboratory, one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[561] The latter led to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.\n The rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[563] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and aeronautics.[564][565]\n The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[566][567][568] This, in turn, led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.[569]\n These advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for individual use.[570] As of 2013, 83.8% of American households owned at least one computer, and 73.3% had high-speed Internet service.[571] 91% of Americans also own a mobile phone as of May 2013. The United States ranks highly with regard to freedom of use of the internet.[573]\n In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector.[574] The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.[575][576]\n Income, poverty and wealth Further information: Income in the United States, Poverty in the United States, Affluence in the United States, United States counties by per capita income, and Income inequality in the United States \n Accounting for 4.4% of the global population, Americans collectively possess 41.6% of the world's total wealth,[577] and Americans make up roughly half of the world's population of millionaires.[578] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[579] Americans on average have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and more than every EU nation.[580] For 2017 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 13th among 189 countries in its Human Development Index and 25th among 151 countries in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[581]\n   Wealth inequality in the United States increased from 1989 to 2013.\n \n\n After years of stagnant growth, in 2016, according to the Census, median household income reached a record high after two consecutive years of record growth, although income inequality remains at record highs with top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income.[583] There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[584] However, the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance.[585] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected income inequality,[586] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[587] According to a 2018 study by the OECD, the United States has much higher income inequality and a larger percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation. This is largely because at-risk workers get almost no government support and are further set back by a very weak collective bargaining system.[588] The top 1 percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers.[589] The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.[590][591]\n  United States' families median net worth Source: Fed Survey of Consumer Finances[593]    in 2013 dollars 1998 2013 change    All families $102,500 $81,200 -20.8%    Bottom 20% of incomes $8,300 $6,100 -26.5%    2nd lowest 20% of incomes $47,400 $22,400 -52.7%    Middle 20% of incomes $76,300 $61,700 -19.1%    Top 10% $646,600 $1,130,700 +74.9%     Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.[594] According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016.[595] Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[596] Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down $14 trillion, but has since increased $14 trillion over 2006 levels.[597][598] At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to $11.8 trillion,[599] down from $13.8 trillion at the end of 2008.[600]\n There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[601] In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic. According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty, up from one in seven in 1980.[603] As of September 2017, 40 million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, with 18.5 million of those living in deep poverty (a family income below one-half of the poverty threshold). In 2016, 13.3 million children were living in poverty, which made up 32.6% of the impoverished population.[604]\n In 2017, the region with the lowest poverty rate was New Hampshire (7.3%), and the region with the highest poverty rate was American Samoa (65%).[605][606][607] Among the states, the highest poverty rate was in Mississippi (21.9%).[608] According to the UN, around five million people in the U.S. live in \"third world\" conditions.[609]\n Infrastructure Transportation Main article: Transportation in the United States \n  The Interstate Highway System, which extends 46,876 miles (75,440 km).[610] \n \n\n Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads,[611] including one of the world's longest highway systems at 57,000 mi (91,700 km). The world's second-largest automobile market,[613] the United States has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (1996).[614] About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.[615] The average American adult (accounting for all drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling 29 miles (47 km).[616] In 2017, there were 255,009,283 motor vehicles—including cars, vans, buses, freight, and other trucks, but excluding motorcycles and other two-wheelers—or 910 vehicles per 1,000 people.[617]\n  Map showing Amtrak (passenger) rail speeds in the United States.[618] \n \n\n Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips.[619]Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, partly because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior. However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010. Also, light rail development has increased in recent years. Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.\n The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while  most major airports are publicly owned. The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways. Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the fourth-busiest Los Angeles International Airport, and the sixth-busiest O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks of 2001, the Transportation Security Administration was created to police airports and commercial airliners. \n Energy Further information: Energy policy of the United States \n The United States energy market is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year.Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons (7076 kg) of oil equivalent per year, the 10th-highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[630] The United States is the world's largest consumer of petroleum.[631] The United States has 27% of global coal reserves. It is the world's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.[633]\n For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception following the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants were filed.[634]\n Since 2007, the total greenhouse gas emissions by the United States are the second highest by country, exceeded only by China.[635][636] The United States has historically been the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases and greenhouse gas emissions per capita remain high.[637]\n Water supply and sanitation Main article: Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States \n Issues that affect water supply in the United States include droughts in the West, water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.[638][639][o]\n Culture Main article: Culture of the United States \n The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[643] Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries.[644] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[645] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.\n Core American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism,[646] as well as a unifying belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[647] Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times the French figure of 0.14%.[648][649][650]\n The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[651] Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate.[653][654][655][656] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[657] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[658] Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree.[659] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.[660]\n Food Main article: Cuisine of the United States \n   Apple pie is a food commonly associated with American cuisine.\n \n\n Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour[661] and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. These homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[663]\n  Roasted turkey is a traditional menu item of an American Thanksgiving dinner.[664] \n \n\n Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[665] Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea.[666] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[667][668]\n American eating habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary roots with some variations. Although American lands could grow newer vegetables that Britain could not, most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by Europeans.[669] Over time American foods changed to a point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in 1972: \"Our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence\".[670]\n The American fast food industry, the world's largest,[671] pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s. Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans' caloric intake rose 24%;[665] frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American \"obesity epidemic\".[673] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake.[674]\n Literature, philosophy, and visual art Main articles: American literature, American philosophy, Architecture of the United States, and Visual art of the United States \n   Mark Twain, American author and humorist.\n \n\n In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[675] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)—may be dubbed the \"Great American Novel\".[676]\n Twelve U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Bob Dylan in 2016. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[677] Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[678]\n The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy, and Martha Nussbaum is its most important figure today. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have affected various fields in social and political philosophy.[679][680]\n In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[681]Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.[683]\n   Times Square in New York City, the hub of the Broadway theaterdistrict[684] \n \n\n One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O'Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.[685]\n ChoreographersIsadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance, while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet.[citation needed]\n Music Main articles: Music of the United States and American classical music \n Although little known at the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. \n The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[686]\n Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[687][688][689] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk. \n More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities,[686] as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Eminem, Kanye West, and Ariana Grande.[690]\n Cinema Main article: Cinema of the United States \n  The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California\n \n\n Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[691] The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope. The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[693]\n Director D. W. Griffith, the top American filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[694] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West and history, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting, with great influence on subsequent directors. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[695] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[696][697] In the 1970s, film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were a vital component in what became known as \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\",[698] grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[699] Since, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs, and in return, high earnings at the box office, with the Russo brothers, Avengers: Endgame (2019) being the highest grossing film of all time.[700]\n Notable films topping the American Film Institute's AFI 100 list include Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time,[701]Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler's List (1993), Singin' in the Rain (1952), It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).[703] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[704] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[705]\n Sports Main article: Sports in the United States \n   \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n The most popular American sports are American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey[706] \n\n \n\n American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport;[707] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally. Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different but overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.[708] In soccer, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men's national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women's team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup four times; Major League Soccer is the sport's highest league in the United States (featuring 21 American and 3 Canadian teams). The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[709]\n Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States (2028 Summer Olympics will mark the ninth time). As of 2017, the United States has won 2,522 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 305 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.[710] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[711] The most watched individual sports are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.[713]Rugby union is considered the fastest growing sport in the U.S., with registered players, numbered at 115,000+ and a further 1.2 million participants.[714]\n Mass media Main article: Media of the United States \n  The corporate headquarters of the American Broadcasting Company in New York City\n \n\n The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[715] Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[716]\n In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other). As of September 30, 2014, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[717]\n Well-known newspapers include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and USA Today.[718] Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have \"alternative weeklies\" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.[719] Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon, and Twitter.\n More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.\n See also \n     Notes  ^\n  ^English is the official language of 32 states; English and Hawaiian are both official languages in Hawaii, and English and 20 Indigenous languages are official in Alaska. Algonquian, Cherokee, and Sioux are among many other official languages in Native-controlled lands throughout the country. French is a de facto, but unofficial, language in Maine and Louisiana, while New Mexico law grants Spanish a special status.[4][5] \n  ^ In five territories, English as well as one or more indigenous languages are official: Spanish in Puerto Rico, Samoan in American Samoa, Chamorro in both Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Carolinian is also an official language in the Northern Mariana Islands. \n  ^ abcThe Encyclopædia Britannica lists China as the world's third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) with a total area of 9,572,900 sq km,[16] and the United States as fourth-largest at 9,526,468 sq km. The figure for the United States is less than in the CIA World Factbook because it excludes coastal and territorial waters.[17]\nThe CIA World Factbook lists the United States as the third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) with total area of 9,833,517 sq km,[18] and China as fourth-largest at 9,596,960 sq km.[19] This figure for the United States is greater than in the Encyclopædia Britannica because it includes coastal and territorial waters. \n  ^ ab Excludes Puerto Rico and the other unincorporated islands. \n  ^ See Time in the United States for details about laws governing time zones in the United States. \n  ^ Except the U.S. Virgin Islands. \n  ^ISO 3166 designation. In actual use, the six original Generic top-level domains are preferred. \n  ^The five major territories are American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. There are eleven smaller island areas without permanent populations: Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, and Palmyra Atoll. U.S. sovereignty over Bajo Nuevo Bank, Navassa Island, Serranilla Bank, and Wake Island is disputed.[15] \n  ^Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska to assert its long-held claim over the Pacific Northwest, which dated back to the 16th century. During the decade 1785–1795 British merchants, encouraged by Sir Joseph Banks and supported by their government, made a sustained attempt to develop this trade despite Spain's claims and navigation rights. The endeavors of these merchants did not last long in the face of Spain's opposition. The challenge was also opposed by a Japanese holding obdurately to national seclusion.[99] \n  ^Fertility is also a factor; in 2010 the average Hispanic woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her lifetime, compared to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic white women (both below the replacement rate of 2.1). Between 2006 and 2017 the population growth rate for Hispanics dropped from 3.7% to 2.0%, for Asians from 3.5% to 2.9%, for blacks from 1.0% to 0.9% and for non-Hispanic whites from 0.1% to 0.0%. Hispanics accounted for 51% of the population increase between 2016 and 2017.Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 36.3% of the population in 2010 (this is nearly 40% in 2015), and over 50% of children under age one, and are projected to constitute the majority by 2042. This contradicts the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports, based on the U.S. census data, which concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386 in 2010) of births were non-Hispanic white. The Hispanic birth rate plummeted 25% between 2006 and 2013 while the rate for non-Hispanics decreased just 5%. \n  ^Source: 2015 American Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau. Most respondents who speak a language other than English at home also report speaking English \"well\" or \"very well\". For the language groups listed above, the strongest English-language proficiency is among speakers of German (96% report that they speak English \"well\" or \"very well\"), followed by speakers of French (93.5%), Tagalog (92.8%), Spanish (74.1%), Korean (71.5%), Chinese (70.4%), and Vietnamese (66.9%). \n  ^In January 2015, U.S. federal government debt held by the public was approximately $13 trillion, or about 72% of U.S. GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5 trillion, giving a combined total debt of $18.080 trillion.[456][457] By 2012, total federal debt had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP.[458] The U.S. has a credit rating of AA+ from Standard &amp; Poor's, AAA from Fitch, and AAA from Moody's.[459] \n  ^The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, found that the United States' arms industry was the world's biggest exporter of major weapons from 2005 to 2009, and remained the largest exporter of major weapons during a period between 2010 and 2014, followed by Russia, China (PRC), and Germany.[533] \n  ^Droughts are likely to particularly affect the 66 percent of Americans whose communities depend on surface water.[640] As for drinking water quality, there are concerns about disinfection by-products, lead, perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances, but generally drinking water quality in the U.S. is good.[641] \n \n\n References   ^McKenna 2007, p. 280. \n  ^Kidder &amp; Oppenheim 2007, p. 91. \n  ^\"uscode.house.gov\".

英文乃美國政府與民間之常用語,而且至少為28個州的官方語言[10];其中,英語分別與夏威夷語及阿留申語同時為夏威夷及阿拉斯加的官方語言。奧克拉荷馬州一些由美洲原住民管治的地方則以切羅基語為官方語言。法語雖不是緬因州和路易斯安那州的官方語言,但卻是當地的常用語。除此,新墨西哥州給予西班牙語特殊的地位。[11] \n  ^

United States,或 U.S., America 或 The States),通稱合眾國或亞美利加,中文通稱「美國」,是由其下轄50個州、華盛頓哥倫比亞特區、五個自治領土及外島共同組成的聯邦共和國[註 1]。美國本土48州和聯邦特區位於北美洲中部,東臨大西洋,西臨太平洋,北面是加拿大,南部和墨西哥及墨西哥灣接壤[15],本土位於溫帶、副熱帶地區。阿拉斯加州位於北美大陸西北方,東部為加拿大,西隔白令海峽和俄羅斯相望;夏威夷州則是太平洋中部的群島。美國在加勒比海和太平洋還擁有多處境外領土和島嶼地區。此外,美國還在全球140多個國家和地區擁有着374個海外軍事基地[16]。 \n 美國國土面積超過982萬平方公里[17],位居世界第三(依陸地面積定義為第四大國)[18];同時擁有接近超過3.3億人口[19],為世界第三人口大國。美國有着來自世界各地的大量移民,是世界上民族和文化最多元的國家之一。美國地形與氣候複雜多樣,是多種野生動物的家園。 \n 一萬五千多年前,古印第安人自亞洲遷徙至北美大陸。16世紀歐洲開始殖民北美。現今的合眾國起始於東海岸的13個英屬美洲殖民地。歐洲七年戰爭後,大不列顛王國與其殖民地之間的爭議愈發劇烈,最終導致在1775年爆發美國革命。1776年7月4日,正與大不列顛進行獨立戰爭的各殖民地派出代表,協同一致發表《獨立宣言》。戰爭終止於1783年,大不列顛王國承認這13個北美殖民地脫離管轄而獨立,與其簽訂《巴黎條約》。這場戰爭也是第一場成功脫離歐洲殖民帝國的獨立戰爭。1781年,《邦聯條例》在邦聯13個構成州獲得通過,共同組成了邦聯議會。1787年《美利堅合眾國憲法》完稿,將「美利堅合眾國」改制為聯邦體制,聯邦政府隨之成立。1791年,合稱為權利法案的十條憲法修正案獲得批准,擔保了基本民權。 \n 自19世紀開始,美國政府透過大量屠殺原住民,征服及購買等方法大力擴張領土,隨着逐漸不斷地承認擴張領地為新州份,至1848年時美國疆域已橫跨整個北美大陸。19世紀下半葉爆發的內戰,使曾經合法的奴隸制度得以終結[30]。在19世紀末,美國已將其領土延伸到太平洋的夏威夷。美國經濟在工業革命的推動下,自那時起也開始蓬勃發展[31]。隨後美西戰爭的勝利,使美國勢力進入加勒比海地區及太平洋西部;而參與第一次世界大戰則奠定其作為一個全球性軍事力量的基礎。儘管在1930年代經歷經濟大蕭條,美國在第二次世界大戰獲得勝利之後崛起成為超級大國。作為聯合國安全理事會常任理事國,美國是世界上第一個研發出核武器,也是唯一一個曾將其投入實戰的國家。戰後美國與蘇聯進行了數十年冷戰,頂峰時期的太空競賽促使了人類第一次登月計劃的成功。在1991年蘇聯解體後,美國成為世上唯一超級強國[33]。 \n 美國作為一個高度發達國家,是世界上最大的進口國及第二大的商品出口國[34][35],國內生產總值按國際匯率排名世界第一、而依購買力平均則位列第二。在國民平均薪資[36]、人類發展指數、人均國內生產總值以及人均生產力[37]等社會經濟學表現指標上,美國均處於世界領先地位。美國經濟已步入後工業時代,服務行業佔據經濟主導地位,位列世界第一。同時,其生產製造業規模也極為龐大,位居於世界第二[38]。僅佔據全世界4.4%人口的美國[39],貢獻了世界四分之一的國內生產總值和三分之一的全球軍事開支[40],這使其在經濟和軍事上均處於全世界最重要的地位。美國在政治和文化上是一支世界顯著並影響深遠的力量,也在科學研究和技術創新上佔據世界領導地位[41]。美國是聯合國、世界銀行、國際貨幣基金組織、美洲國家組織等的創始成員國。 \n 目錄\n\n  國名[編輯]   英文名稱[編輯]   由詹姆斯·蒙哥馬利·弗拉格繪製的1917年美軍募兵海報\n \n\n 「The United States」這個名字是對美國最傳統和正式的名稱,出現在獨立宣言與美國憲法(Constitution of the United States),在官方場合,國家安排需求說到美國時,一般均必須運用此通稱。最初是複數,例如「The United States are」,包括1856年批准使用的《美國憲法》第十三條修正案。直到美國內戰結束後才使用單數,「The United States is」。現在單數形式是標準[43],簡稱爲U.S.。「United States of America」,由約翰·迪金森編寫於1776年6月17日的聯邦條款第二草稿出現[44],縮寫是U.S.A.。作為法定政權的名稱,它的應用度並沒有US廣泛。雖然兩者都可使用,但也有特定的使用範圍,USA使用最多的地方就是在體育賽事上。例如在電視上顯示參賽選手國家的旗子使用ISO標準,簡稱就是U.S.A,除此之外,美國簽署官方文件必須在第一次出現的時候使用代表政權的全名「United States of America」;另一種簡稱是「America」,1507年,由德國製圖員馬丁·瓦爾德澤米勒製作的《世界地理概論》中,美洲首次在世界地圖上被標注為「America」。[45]因為意大利探險家亞美利哥·韋斯普奇指出這塊大陸是新大陸而非當時包括哥倫布等人所認為的亞洲東部。美國因美洲而得名。在英語中,亞美利加和美利堅為同一詞「America」,只是中譯不同,前者指美洲,後者指美國。[46][47] 「哥倫比亞」是美國一度流行的名稱,來自哥倫布,一些美國事物至今仍沿用「哥倫比亞」的名稱,如華盛頓哥倫比亞特區、哥倫比亞廣播公司等。[48]\n  漢字名稱[編輯]  美國早先在清朝時因國旗的圖案而獲別稱「花旗國」;一些美國事物的中文名稱至今仍含有「花旗」的字樣,如美國特產花旗參以及美國最大銀行之一 —— 花旗銀行(Citibank)。 \n 官方文件可溯自乾隆年間之「咪唎」[49],曾國藩也指出「咪夷質性醇厚,於中國時思效順。」[50]道光年間則稱「米利堅」[51],後採裨治文等人譯「亞美理駕合眾國」,簡稱「美國」或「合眾國」,參見1844年《望廈條約》、1858年《天津條約》、1901年《辛丑條約》;1860年以降逐漸用「美」代「米」,及至宣統退位前簽訂《各國禁煙公約》為「美利堅合眾國」。 \n 此外,尚有「咩哩干」(《海錄》)[53]、「彌利堅」(《四洲志》、《海國圖志》)、「美利哥」(《瀛寰志略》提及別名)譯名等等;日本與華交流亦受影響,例如江戶時代《神奈川條約》使用美國譯名「米利堅合眾國」、「亞墨利加」可見於《瀛寰志略·卷九·北亞墨利加米利堅合眾國》,也就是日文簡稱「米國」由來。 \n 美國的諺文名稱「미국」所對應的朝鮮漢字,在南韓(標準韓國語)為「美國」,在北韓(文化語)則為「米國」;至於美國在越南國語字中的慣用名稱「Hoa Kỳ」,所對應的越南漢字名稱為「花旗」。 \n  歷史[編輯]  主條目:美國歷史 \n  原住民與歐洲殖民者[編輯]    西班牙探險家哥倫布和他的船員認為扺達印度時的情景,但他們卻不知道身在美洲 \n \n\n  1620年,100餘名英國清教徒乘五月花號來到新大陸。這幅圖畫是由歐洲畫家威廉·哈爾索爾於1882年所畫的作品\n \n\n 參見:前哥倫布時期、伍德蘭期和密西西比文化 \n 考古學研究顯示,公元前5萬年左右人類開始出現在美洲。基本與人類出現在日本和斯堪的納維亞的時間相同。史前移民來自亞洲和歐洲。主要的移民活動發生在約1.4萬-1.1萬年前。之後形成美洲原住民[54]。 \n 1492年10月12日,在西班牙女王支持下,哥倫布到達巴哈馬群島的聖薩爾瓦多島[54]。1493年,哥倫布在今聖多明各建立第一個西班牙殖民地[54]。北美洲的原住民起初熱情幫助移民,但換來的卻是殖民者的捕殺、驅趕和奴役,原住民從此開始被殖民[55]。 \n 1607年,位於倫敦的維珍尼亞公司在北美切薩皮克灣的詹姆斯敦建立英國第一個短暫殖民地[54]。其後,英國在北美大西洋沿岸的東北部和中部陸續建立殖民地。1624年,荷蘭在哈得遜河口建立殖民地-新尼德蘭,並在此後的幾十年間擴展到康涅狄格和特拉華河谷[54]。1652年至1675年,英國與荷蘭發生三次戰爭,其後荷蘭永久撤離北美,英國則得到新尼德蘭並繼續拓展殖民地。到了1775年,北美美國獨立戰爭,英國在北美大西洋沿岸的現美國境內先後建立13個殖民地(新罕布什爾、馬薩諸塞、羅得島、康涅狄格、紐約、賓夕凡尼亞、新澤西、特拉華、馬利蘭、維珍尼亞、北卡羅萊納、南卡羅萊納和佐治亞)[56]。 \n  獨立與擴張[編輯]   各殖民地的代表簽訂《獨立宣言》時的場景\n \n\n 主條目:美國獨立戰爭、美國革命、美國領土擴張和美國領土變遷 \n 在1760年代和1770年代,13個北美殖民地與英國之間的關係趨於緊張,導致1774年與1775年的一連串武裝衝突。出席第二屆大陸會議的13個殖民地的代表們在1776年7月4日簽下《美國獨立宣言》,使得武裝衝突轉化為獨立戰爭,代表們並於會中決議創立大陸軍以對抗英軍,由佐治·華盛頓領導[57]。1781年,《邦聯條例》獲得13個構成州的全數同意,一個永久性邦聯成立。在法國和西班牙幫助下,經歷艱苦的8年獨立戰爭後,大陸軍團終於擊敗英軍,使得英國於1783年簽下《巴黎條約》,正式承認13個北美殖民地的獨立。1787年的制憲會議,提出了一部使邦聯轉變成聯邦體制的憲法,1789年6月,這部《美利堅合眾國憲法》獲得13個州中的9個州批准生效[58]。 \n 19世紀起,美國國內開始出現「命運天定論」,「昭昭天命」成為美國19世紀時的政治標語[59][60],其中一層含義就是美國人是「天選之人」必須要擴張領土與勢力。在美國的擴張主義思潮領導下,美國西進運動崛起,開始向西部開始擴張。從1803年至1848年,美國的面積比獨立時擴大了幾乎三倍,胸懷新的共和國註定「擴展至整個大陸」的理想,朝廣闊無際的原野拓展,甚至在路易斯安那購地之前便已深入內陸[61]。這種擴展在1812年戰爭時遭到短暫的阻撓,但很快隨着戰爭的結束而繼續進行。從此役之後,美國民眾增強「從大洋到大洋」擴展的思潮,認為是不可抵抗的命運。1848年美國攻陷南方的墨西哥首都,贏得美墨戰爭。墨西哥承認德薩斯併入美國,也割讓了200多萬平方公里土地(相當於其領土的一半)給美國。美國政府鼓勵民眾向西墾荒,還鼓勵修築鐵路,與美洲原住民發生更多衝突。19世紀後期美軍與民兵發動多次剿滅美洲原住民行動,直到永遠結束美洲原住民的生活方式為止[63]。 \n  奴隸制、內戰和工業城市化[編輯]    蓋茨堡之役是美國內戰的主要轉折點之一。\n \n\n 主條目:美國內戰和美國重建時期 \n 隨着國家不斷擴展和發展,一個新的問題也逐漸浮現,北方主導的聯邦政府與南方的州政府在蓄奴問題和州權上有所分歧:北方州反對擴展奴隸制度的(並非反對奴隸制),反對新加入的州實行奴隸制度;而南方州反對北方州干涉其生活方式,因為他們的棉花經濟產業是全盤依賴於奴隸制度的[64]。 \n 在共和黨的亞伯拉罕·林肯於1860年當選總統後,衝突徹底爆發[65],這是由於林肯所屬的共和黨反對擴展奴隸制度。南卡羅萊納州成為第一個宣佈脫離聯邦的州,六個南部州也相繼分離,於1861年成立美利堅聯盟國以對抗聯邦政府。林肯就任後不久,內戰正式爆發,美國內戰以聯邦在1865年取得勝利告終,同時終結奴隸制度以及州是否有權脫離聯邦的爭議。這場內戰成為美國歷史的主要分水嶺,聯邦政府的權力從此大為增加[66],也確立了共和黨控制美國政壇的地位,直至1933年為止。 \n  1902年美國東岸的移民在紐約埃利斯島創辦工廠,鐵路和農場。\n \n\n 內戰期間的科技發展和來自歐洲的大量移民潮為美國的新興產業提供大量的勞動力,在從前乏人問津之處建立許多社區和城市,加快美國的工業發展以及邁向國際強權的速度。接着,美國在海外進行許多帝國主義的冒險,包括在美西戰爭[67]勝利後吞併波多黎各和菲律賓等西班牙大部分的海外殖民地,使美國成為世界主要的列強之一[68]。 \n  兩次世界大戰與經濟大恐慌[編輯]  主條目:一戰、大蕭條、羅斯福新政和二戰 \n 第一次世界大戰於1914年爆發,美國最初保持中立;由於德國發動的無限制潛艇戰擊沉在大西洋航行的美國船隻(RMS Lusitania),造成許多美國平民的無辜死傷,激怒美國民眾[69]。在戰爭最後階段,美國在1917年加入協約國以對抗同盟國。由於歷史原因,美國大眾對於英國和法國較為同情,雖然有部分德裔和愛爾蘭裔反對介入[70]。為了保護美國投資者和聯邦政府在歐洲的大量投資也是美國參戰的主因之一。在美國於1917年參戰後,對戰局有所扭轉,使協約國在1918年獲勝。戰後,擔心過度捲入歐洲事務,美國參議院並未批准協約國制裁同盟國的凡爾賽條約[71];相反,美國採取孤立主義政策。 \n 戰爭使英法德等國家元氣大傷。而由於戰爭從未在美洲本土進行,給美國帶來大量財富和聲望。在幾乎整個1920年代,農產品價格不斷降低,工業利潤大幅增長,美國經濟發展的異常繁榮。另外信貸上升和股票市場的興盛也在這波經濟成長中起到推波助瀾的作用,終於令股市在1929年大崩盤,隨之而來的是經濟大恐慌。經濟大恐慌最終終結了共和黨數十年主導美國政治的地位,民主黨的富蘭克林·德拉諾·羅斯福上台執政。 \n 為了復甦經濟,富蘭克林·德拉諾·羅斯福政府實行新政,大幅增加聯邦政府對市場經濟的干預,然而,美國經濟直到第二次世界大戰後才徹底復甦[73]。 \n 1941年12月7日在日本偷襲珍珠港後,美國加入反法西斯同盟以對抗軸心國。接下來的多場戰役成為美國歷史上代價最高昂的一場戰爭,然而前線和大後方創造的大量工作機會、以及軍工產業帶動的生產復甦,使美國經濟完全走出大恐慌的陰霾。美國婦女也因此大規模踏入工作職場[74]。 \n  冷戰時期和種族衝突[編輯]  主條目:冷戰、朝鮮戰爭、越南戰爭、古巴導彈危機、阿富汗戰爭 (1979年)、太空競賽和美國黑人民權運動 \n   美國黑人民權運動的領導人馬丁·路德·金 \n \n\n  1969年,美國太空人巴茲·奧爾德林在月球上豎起國旗\n \n\n 在戰爭勝利後,美國和蘇聯的衝突逐漸浮現,美國代表的是經濟方面實行資本主義政策的市場經濟模式和政治上的自由民主制,而蘇聯則代表實行社會主義政策的計劃經濟模式和一黨專政制度,蘇聯的崛起和意識形態的衝突造成1940年代末期開始的冷戰[75]。兩國在許多地區和國家進行一連串代理人戰爭,包括韓戰、越南戰爭、5次中東戰爭以及幾乎觸發核大戰的古巴導彈危機、以及阿富汗戰爭[76]。 \n 在美國太空總署的努力下,後於美國時間1969年7月20日第一次成功派人登上月球。 \n 同時在美國國內,美國社會的種族隔離現象逐漸受到重視,尤其是在南方。從1950年代開始,這些歧視法律受到馬丁·路德·金等人領導的民權運動的挑戰,最後終於廢除南方各州的種族隔離法律[77],1964年民權法案也定下條文禁止對任何種族及性別任何形式的歧視,包括工作和教育的歧視[78]。雖然如此,美國種族問題及經濟不平等的深層矛盾至今仍未完全解決[79]。 \n  當代[編輯]   2001年9月11日,九一一事件在紐約世界貿易中心爆發[80][81] \n \n\n 參見:反恐戰爭 \n 經歷1970年代石油危機引發的經濟衰退後,羅納德·雷根在1980年當選總統。在1980年代,他大力推行雷根經濟學,美國經濟於1980年代開始復甦。蘇聯在1991年解體,美國成為世界上唯一的超級大國[83]。美國依然繼續派兵參與海外的戰爭,例如1991年的波斯灣戰爭。在1990年代,拜數碼革命以及互聯網製造的大量工作機會和技術變革之賜,美國經濟經歷史無前例的繁榮成長,新興的矽谷成為世界資訊產業的龍頭重鎮,誕生諸如蘋果公司以及Google在內的大量資訊產業公司[84][85]。 \n 在21世紀初發生的九一一襲擊事件,縱使事件直接導致的傷害有限,但已然重創美國民眾的信心。這起事件促使美國的外交政策將對付恐怖主義威脅作為焦點之一[86]。美國政府開始反恐戰爭和行動——阿富汗戰爭,在2001年10月推翻阿富汗塔利班政權後,於該年12月份建立起阿富汗臨時政府;又在2003年發動伊拉克戰爭,推翻薩達姆·侯賽因的政權,建立伊拉克臨時政府[87]。由於美國對於當地政府過於強勢的態度及軍事力量,引發所駐兵地區人民的擔憂。美國在反恐駐兵過程中,因為各種機遇而發生一些廣為流傳的虐囚醜聞和襲擊無辜平民事件,如美軍虐待伊拉克戰俘事件、美軍褻瀆古蘭經事件、維基解密公佈的美軍屠殺伊拉克平民錄像以及美國設在世界各地的黑獄等等,受到當地人士及世界多國的強烈譴責[88][89][90]。 \n 自2008年底,美國經濟陷入次貸危機,經濟一度遭受重創,目前已經進入復甦期,失業率也已從最高峰的百分之十開始下滑。不過,整起次貸危機對於美國的世界強國地位目前依然未有動搖。2009年1月20日,美國歷史上第一個非洲裔美國人總統巴拉克·侯賽恩·奧巴馬宣誓就職,於2017年1月卸任。2017年1月20日,美國歷史上最年長的總統當勞·特朗普宣誓就職[91]。 \n  地理[編輯]  主條目:美國地理 \n 美國領土廣闊,本土三面臨水,氣候適中,資源豐富,地理由東低地爬升到西部高地。 \n  領土面積[編輯]  主條目:美國領土 \n 參見:國家面積列表 \n  領土開拓史[編輯]  主條目:美國領土變遷 \n   \n 美國疆域變更圖\n \n\n  \n 1789年的美國領土由東岸的13個州組成,而當時西部地區大多為西班牙所有,北方阿拉斯加則是俄國領土,夏威夷則是獨立王國\n \n\n \n\n 自1783年9月3日《巴黎條約》簽訂,美國獨立獲得承認以來,美國領土向西逐步擴張,前後擴張7次,州數也由最初的13州增加到目前的50州。 \n 主要大的進展: \n  1803年4月30日,美國和法國簽訂路易斯安娜購地,美國以1500萬美元購得2,144,476平方公里土地,相當於今日美國國土面積的22.3%,與當時美國原有國土面積大致相當,使得美國領土大幅向西擴張;[97] \n 1819年,從西班牙購得佛羅里達州;[98] \n 1845年,德薩斯共和國併入美國(德薩斯共和國於1836年獨立自墨西哥);[99] \n 1848年,美墨戰爭後,加利福尼亞共和國從墨西哥獨立並加入聯邦,美國獲取加利福尼亞州、內華達州、猶他州全部地區,科羅拉多州、亞利桑那州、新墨西哥州和懷俄明州部分地區;[100] \n 1864年,與英國簽署條約,取得俄勒岡(包括今天的俄勒岡州、華盛頓州和愛達華州);[101] \n 1867年4月9日,美國以七百二十萬美元從俄羅斯帝國買到阿拉斯加,1959年升格為美國的第49個州;\n 1898年8月12日,美西戰爭結束後,西班牙以2000萬美元的代價割讓菲律賓、關島、波多黎各予美國;同年美國吞併夏威夷,1959年8月21日夏威夷正式成為美國第50個州。[103] \n   現狀[編輯]  主條目:美國領地 \n 美國本土由50個州和華盛頓哥倫比亞特區組成。其中48州彼此相連,地處北美洲中部。剩下的兩個州中,阿拉斯加州位於北美洲西北部,東部與加拿大接壤,西部與俄羅斯西伯利亞地區隔海相望;夏威夷州則處在太平洋的群島上,位於北美大陸的西南方3700公里。此外,美國也擁有許多散佈於加勒比海(例如波多黎各)與太平洋(例如關島)上的海外領土。美國國土東至大西洋、西至太平洋、南至墨西哥灣、北至加拿大、北冰洋(阿拉斯加州)。[104]\n   阿拉斯加州的迪納利山是北美洲最高的山脈。\n \n\n  地形[編輯]   美國地形圖\n \n\n 美國國土地形變化多端,尤其是在西部。東海岸沿海地區有着海岸平原,在南部較為寬廣,而在北部較為狹窄,海岸平原在新澤西州以北並不存在,不過在長島等地也有一些冰川沉積平原。在海岸平原後方的是地形起伏的山麓地帶,延伸到位於北卡羅萊納州和新罕布什爾州、高1830米的阿巴拉契亞山脈為止。在阿巴拉契亞山脈以西是美國中西部地帶的內部平原,這裏相對而言較為平坦,五大湖和密西西比河-密蘇里河流域—世界上第四大的河域[105]也位於這裏。在密西西比河以西,內部平原的地形開始上升,最後進入美國中部面積廣闊而地形特色稀少的大平原。 \n 在大平原西部則有高聳的洛磯山脈,從南至北將美國大陸一分為二,在科羅拉多州的最高峰到達4270米[106]。在以前洛磯山脈還有頻繁的火山活動;如今則只剩下一個區域(懷俄明州黃石國家公園的超級火山—可能是世界上最大的火山)。 \n  大盆地的位置-橙色部分\n \n\n 在洛磯山脈以西有一個高原內陸盆地—大盆地,該地帶有大量的高山、鹽帶平原和山谷,其間的沙漠稱為大盆地沙漠,是北美最大的沙漠。內華達山脈本身也有崎嶇的峽谷。在大盆地的西南方則有低於海平線的死谷(Death Valley),那裏也是西半球最低矮的地區之一。大盆地帶北方和喀斯喀特山脈東方的則是哥倫比亞高原,有着一個大規模的火成岩區,是地球上最大的洪流玄武岩地區。而在大臉盆地帶西方的內華達山脈則有美國本土海拔最高的惠特尼山(4418米)。 \n  科羅拉多高原跨越南部四州\n \n\n 由科羅拉多河貫穿的科羅拉多高原坐落於四角落州正中央,高原跨猶他州、科羅拉多州、亞利桑那州和新墨西哥州,高原的面積是337,000平方公里,高原的平均海拔高度達600至3870米,並且有經過強烈侵蝕的砂岩地帶,這些紅土高原也是數個國家公園坐落的地方,包括布萊斯、大峽谷和宰恩等。 \n 在太平洋沿岸地區是太平洋海岸山脈和喀斯喀特山脈,從南至北穿越美國。 \n 阿拉斯加州也有許多山脈,包括北美洲最高6194米的迪納利山,阿拉斯加大陸以西和以南的阿留申群島上也有許多火山。 \n 夏威夷群島則是熱帶的火山島群,分佈面積超過2400公里,由6個大島和其他一些小島組成。 \n  氣候[編輯]   美國氣候帶地圖\n \n\n 主條目:美國氣候 \n 由於幅員遼闊和眾多的地理特徵,美國幾乎有着世界上所有的氣候類型: \n  美國各地平均降雨圖\n \n\n 影響美國氣候的主要是北極氣流,每年從太平洋帶來大規模的低氣壓,這些低氣壓在通過內華達山脈、洛磯山脈、和喀斯喀特山脈時夾帶大量水分,當這些氣壓到達中部大平原時便能進行重組,導致主要的氣團相遇而帶來激烈的大雷雨,尤其是在春季和夏季。有時這些豪雨可能與其他的低氣壓會合,繼續前往東海岸和大西洋,並會演變為更激烈的東北風暴(Nor'easter),在美國東北的中大西洋區域和紐英倫形成廣泛而沉重的降雪。大平原廣闊無比的草原也形成許多世界上最極端的氣候轉變現象。 \n 大盆地地區和哥倫比亞高原則是乾旱而極少降雨的地區,最乾旱時平均降雨量少於38毫米。美國西南部是乾旱的沙漠,夏季時最熱的數個禮拜溫度超過38°C。西南部和大盆地地區也會受到來自加利福尼亞灣的季風影響,偶而會帶來少見的大雨。加利福尼亞州大多數區域都屬於地中海式氣候,有時會在每年的10月至隔年的4月引發強烈豪雨,而其他月份幾乎全無降雨。瀕臨太平洋的西北方地區則終年豪雨不斷,但在冬季和春季降雨量最大。西部山脈吸收充足的濕氣,降雨量和降雪都相當沉重。喀斯喀特山脈是世界上降雪量最多的地方之一,但海拔較低的沿海地區降雪不多。 \n 近年來由於全球暖化導致的持續性氣候變遷,包括加利福尼亞州、內華達州、亞利桑那州與數個其餘州在內的西部地區自2011年開始發生連續四年的嚴重乾旱,降雪量降至僅僅平均百分之六的歷史新低,導致水庫儲水量大幅削減,同時也導致加利福尼亞州農業灌溉與民用水源的大幅度限制。加利福尼亞州更是在2015年4月1日宣佈該州有史以來首個大幅減少用水量百分之二十五的行政命令。[107]\n  生物[編輯]    白頭海鵰從1782年後便正式成為美國的國鳥 \n \n\n 美國有超過17,000種本土的植物和樹種,光是加利福尼亞州就有5000種,從熱帶地區至北極都有植物分佈,美國的植物是世界上最多樣化的,同時,數千種非本土的外來物種有時也會影響到本土的動植物。美國本土有超過400種哺乳類、700種鳥類、500種爬蟲類和兩棲類以及900,000種已經被發現的昆蟲[108]。許多植物和動物都僅限於它們的分佈區域,有些則瀕臨絕種的危險。 \n 美國也是世界上最早開始重視環境保護的國家之一,聯邦政府管理的58座國家公園保護大量生態各異的大自然地區[109]。某些地區也成立荒野保護區,以確保對當地動植物棲息地的長期保護。美國魚類及野生動物管理局負責監控瀕臨絕種和威脅的動植物,並在全國成立許許多多的動植物棲息保留區。這些動植物保護區域全部加起來高達2,643,807平方公里——佔全國總面積的28.8%[110]。這些土地都由聯邦政府保護,但有些地區也放寬允許石油的勘查、採礦業和大農場的經營。 \n  水文與山脈[編輯]  主條目:美國河流列表和美國山川列表 \n  密西西比河及其主要支流地圖\n \n\n 密西西比河是北美洲最長的河流,水系全長6,270公里,為世界第四長河(前三名分別為尼羅河、亞馬遜河和長江);流域面積2,980,000平方公里,是北美大陸流域面積最廣的水系,兩岸多湖泊和沼澤。本流源頭在明尼蘇達州洛磯山北段,流經中央大平原,注入墨西哥灣。除了主流之外,可通航的支流約有40條,水深2.75米的航道達1萬公里,並通過運河與五大湖連成一巨大的內河航運系統。 \n   \n  阿巴拉契亞山脈圖\n \n  \n  洛磯山脈圖\n \n \n\n\n 東部的阿巴拉契亞山脈和西部的洛磯山脈(屬於世界最長的山系——科迪勒拉山系)是美國的兩大山脈。 \n 洛磯山脈位於北美洲西部,從加拿大橫越美國西部、直到新墨西哥州,綿延超過4,800公里。洛磯山積雪融化補充河流和湖泊的水源,佔美國全部淡水水源的1/4。該山脈蘊藏着豐富的自然資源。 \n  地區劃分[編輯]  主條目:美國地區 \n 美國人口調查局將美國分成四大地區,然後再細分為九個分區: \n  美國人口調查局分區圖:四種顏色代表四大地區\n \n\n  九個分區\n \n\n  國家公園[編輯]    黃石國家公園內正在噴發的城堡噴泉\n \n\n 主條目:美國國家公園列表 \n 黃石是美國第一座國家公園,也是世界上第一個國家公園,由尤利塞斯·S·格蘭特於1872年簽署法令成立。1916年,《美國國家公園管理法》頒佈,成立美國國家公園管理局(內政部下轄)以管理這些公園,其目的為「保護自然風光、野生動植物和歷史遺跡,為人們提供休閒享受,同時不能破壞這些場所,將之流傳給後代。」 \n 美國目前一共有58座國家公園,其中14個被列入世界遺產。合共有27個州擁有國家公園,包括美屬薩摩亞和美屬處女群島。阿拉斯加州和加利福尼亞州各有8座國家公園,居各州之冠。成立國家公園須由美國國會通過相關法案頒佈。 \n  法律與政治[編輯]  主條目:美國政治 \n  法律[編輯]  主條目:美國法律 \n 美國法律繼承英國的判例法傳統,美國法院承襲「遵循先例」原則,屬於英美法系(海洋法系)的重要組成部分。19世紀中葉以前,早期的美國案件仍然經常引用當時的英國案例來應用,此後隨着美國逐步發展起自己的法律制度,到如今美國的絕大多數司法引用自國內案例。 \n 美國憲法是最重要的法律來源,所有其他法律都源於憲法並低於憲法的效力。任何法律不得與憲法相牴觸。基於憲法的最高性,如果國會通過了與憲法相衝突的法律,最高法院可判定該法違憲,任何一個美國法院都可以根據憲法來審理案件。美國最高法院於馬伯利訴麥迪遜案(1803年)中確立法院的這項權力,使得美國成為世界上第一個有違憲審查制度的國家。 \n 目前美國最成功和最有影響力的成文統一法是《統一商法典》(UCC,1952年公佈)與《模範刑法典》(ALI)。 \n 各州因被視為沒有主權的國家,也擁有自己的憲法,他們保留制定除聯邦憲法、聯邦法律和聯邦參議院批准的國際條約規定之外的任何法律的全權。幾乎所有的州都以英國普通法作為立法基礎。路易斯安那州因受法國《拿破崙法典》之極大影響而成例外。 \n  憲法[編輯]   美國憲法原稿第一頁\n \n\n 主條目:美國憲法 \n 美國是現存歷史最悠久的立憲共和國,1789年正式生效的《憲法》是世界上最早並仍在運作的成文憲法。 \n 美國憲法以及權利法案等一系列修正案致力維護公民自由:包括言論、宗教信仰和出版自由;接受公正審判的權利;擁有和攜帶武器的權利;選舉權、被選舉權和財產權。雖然美國獨立宣言被認為是世界人權進展的里程碑,其後制定的憲法被視為是民主和人權的重要文獻,但美國本身歷史證明,其具體實踐中也有爭議:直到1865年奴隸制度廢除;女性到1920年取得投票權;1964年《民權法案》才正式立法禁止涉種族歧視的法律。 \n  聯邦權力機構[編輯]   美國國會大廈全景。國會扮演的是聯邦政府裏的立法部門角色。\n \n\n  美國國會開會時的場景。國會由100名參議員和435名眾議員組成,都是由美國公民選出。\n \n\n 主條目:美國聯邦政府和美國聯邦機構列表 \n 聯邦權力機構本身有三個分支,且互相監督和制衡(三權分立): \n  國會[編輯]  主條目:美國國會 \n 美國國會實行兩院立法體制,設眾議院和參議院。 \n 美國眾議院設435個議席,代表各自的國會選區,每州按人口多寡選出一定比例的議員,眾議員任期2年。席位根據人口分佈,每10年重新劃分一次,每個州最少都會分配到1個眾議院席位。因各州人口的消長變化,目前各州在眾議院最新的席次(自2013年起適用),有7個州只有1個議席,人口最多的加利福尼亞州則有高達53個議席,其次是德薩斯州36席,紐約州27席,佛羅里達州27席,伊利諾州和賓夕凡尼亞州各有18席。 \n 美國參議院設有100個議席,而無論人口眾寡,每個州在參議院都有2個席位,這保障小州在聯邦的地位和利益。參議員任期6年,每隔兩年約三分之一的參議員必須重選。 \n 參見:美國各州人口列表 \n  總統[編輯]   美國白宮南面\n \n\n 主條目:美國總統 \n 總統是國家元首、政府首腦兼武裝部隊總司令,有權提名聯邦各部部長和局長、最高法院法官、各級聯邦法院法官、大使等各項人選,在獲得參議院五分之三通過後即可上任,但如果參議院啟動核選項,修改表決的議事規則,則獲得參議院過半數同意即可上任。在任期內,總統全家會居住在白宮內。總統可以否決任何獲國會通過的法案,但是如果法案獲國會兩院均以三分之二票數通過,總統的否決權將會被推翻。總統可以向國會提出各種咨文和立法計劃。 \n 總統每四年選舉一次,每個人最多只能任兩屆。雖然總統和副總統選舉是由全民普選方式舉行,不過產生方式則由選舉人票(選舉人由民選產生)所決定——除了緬因和內布拉斯加兩個州按普選票得票比例分配選舉人票外,其餘48個州和華盛頓特區均實行「勝者全得」制度,即把本州的選舉人票全部給予在該州獲得相對多數普選票的總統候選人,全國選舉人票為538張,候選人至少須獲得270票才能當選,數目等同國會議員總和及三張華盛頓特區的選舉人票。選舉人團所謂「間接選舉」只是禮儀性的程序,當選的選舉人在選舉人團投票時必須把票投給在該州獲勝的總統候選人,因此大選結果通常在大選投票日當天便可根據各州選舉結果算出。美國人口最多的加利福尼亞州所擁有的選舉人票多達55張,其次為德薩斯州的38張,而人口較少的阿拉斯加州等7州則只有3張選舉人票。鑑於這種情況,在歷屆美國總統選舉中,人口眾多的州都成為總統候選人爭奪的重要目標。美國歷史上曾數次發生這種情形,一些總統候選人雖然在大選中獲得的選民票少於對手,卻因得到足夠的選舉人票而當選。但是,這並不意味着少數選擧人可以操控選舉;相反,選擧人把票投給誰,還是要依靠普選的結果,只是因爲當初在設計的時候未能考慮到這種制度所隱藏的缺陷(由於當時美國通訊不發達,為防止民粹主義影響美國,故設立此機構)而導致普選票少於對方但仍舊當上總統的情況(不忠選舉人)。 \n  總統辦事機構[編輯]   白宮標誌\n \n\n 主條目:美國總統辦事機構 \n 1939年,國會通過一項重組法案,由此創立直接向總統負責的辦事機構。至今機構數量和職員得到大幅擴充。大多數機構的主要領導不須通過國會參議院的確認,只有少數例外,如美國行政管理和預算局局長和美國貿易代表(皆為內閣部長層級),其中許多工作人員來自聯邦政府部門。各辦事機構都由白宮辦公廳主任領導。 \n 目前有以下組成機構: \n  聯邦行政部門[編輯]  主條目:美國聯邦行政部門 \n 聯邦各行政部門的最高首長除了司法部外皆稱為部長,是美國內閣的成員。 \n 現在美國有15個聯邦行政部門: \n  美國國務院徽章\n \n\n  聯邦政府獨立機構[編輯]  主條目:美國政府獨立機構 \n 獨立機構是除了上面15個政府部門以外具備一些行政權力的聯邦部門,主要是以多數成員組成的委員會組成共治的機構。因其技術的專業性和政治上的中立性更能保證他們能夠在所從事的領域獲得較高的效率。下列機構的主要領導人員不同程度地受到美國聯邦政府的管理和監督。 \n 目前主要獨立機構如下: \n  美聯儲總部大樓。\n \n\n  聯邦司法[編輯]   聯邦最高法院大樓\n \n\n 主條目:美國法院和美國聯邦法院 \n 美國聯邦法院負責審理兩個或以上的州之間的糾紛、違犯聯邦法律、國際條約、美國憲法、海洋商業法、破產法等有關案件。 \n 聯邦法院分為三個層級:初審法院即美國地區法院,共94個,審理聯邦司法管轄權內的案件;美國上訴法院共12個,主要裁定來自於其聯邦司法管轄區內對於地區法院判決的上訴案件,大多數案件的終審判決均來自於上訴法院;終審法院即美國最高法院,每年僅接受少於100個司法案件的審理,主要職責是對美國憲法作最終解釋。 \n 聯邦最高法院由9名大法官組成,其中1位是美國首席大法官。每個大法官都是由總統提名,經過參議院聽證後批准委任。對於提交的各種案件,一般由9位大法官以簡單多數票的表決方法來決定。 \n  州與地方選舉[編輯]  參見:美國州份 \n 美國各州政府均擁有自己的州憲法,擁有自己的州參眾兩院(可能根據各別不同而異,除了內布拉斯加州之外,該州只有一個議院)。各州舉行選舉的年分皆不相同。州長任期四年(佛蒙特州和新罕布什爾州的州長任期兩年),可以連任,部分州會對州長的任期設限制,一些州則不設任期限制。 \n  聯邦與州政府的關係[編輯]  參見:聯邦制 \n 在聯邦體制內,州與聯邦政府的關係很複雜。根據美國法律,各州是主權實體。然而,在美國內戰和「德薩斯州訴懷特案」建立的規則是,州無權脫離聯邦;根據憲法,也無外交權。美國聯邦法律在經過憲法授權的領域要高於各州所制訂的不同的法律,但是聯邦政府的權力只能在憲法規定的範圍之內行使;所有未授予聯邦政府的權力由州政府和人民自行保留。 \n 一般而言,州內事務的主導權完全在各州政府手中。這包括內部通訊;關於財產、工業、商業以及公共設施的法規;州的相關法律,諸如死刑;以及州內部的工作情況。很多州立的法律在各州之間都十分相似。在還有一些領域中州的管轄權與聯邦政府的管轄權是重疊的。 \n 最近幾年,聯邦政府在醫療、教育、福利、交通、住宅以及城市發展等領域開始扮演越來越重要的角色。各州的憲法與聯邦憲法基本相符,除了在一些細節上有所不同,其中包括人權和政府組織。而在商業、金融、公共服務和福利機構等方面,州憲法往往比聯邦憲法更為詳細。 \n  政黨[編輯]  主條目:民主黨 (美國)和共和黨 (美國) \n 參見:美國政黨列表 \n 美國聯邦和州的政府與議會主要有兩個政黨競爭:共和黨和民主黨。一些小黨的參選人有時也有可能當選。 \n 共和黨通常在社會議題上屬於社會保守派、在經濟議題上屬於古典自由主義,對外奉行強硬的國防外交政策,屬於干涉主義路線。 \n 民主黨通常在社會議題上屬於自由派、在經濟議題上屬於進步主義及自由主義的路線。 \n 美國人一般會傾向支持兩黨中的其中一個,不過一些人也會支持獨立的小政黨的候選人,包括自由黨、綠黨、憲法黨等。[111]\n 1933年-1995年,民主黨一直控制國會兩院,共和黨僅在1947年-1949年和1953年-1955年兩屆會期短暫取得多數。 \n 1994年共和黨革命後,除了2001-2002年民主黨在參議院暫時佔多數外,共和黨控制國會兩院並保持在兩院的多數優勢直到2007年1月,2010年11月期中選舉中,共和黨重新奪回眾議院的多數,控制眾議院。 \n 在總統選舉方面,自1860年林肯總統當選以來,共和黨一直保持總統職位(四屆除外)直至1932年羅斯褔當選總統。1952年民主黨結束其在白宮20年的執政地位。此後共和黨多能保持總統職位,而民主黨則控制國會。 \n 2008年11月4日民主黨候選人貝拉克·奧巴馬當選第44屆美國總統,於2009年1月20日就任,成為美國史上首任非裔美國人總統。 \n 2016年11月9日,共和黨當勞·特朗普當選第45任美國總統,成為美國歷史上首位政治素人總統。 \n  行政區劃[編輯]  主條目:美國州份、美國行政區劃和美國各州首府列表 \n  華盛頓\n 俄勒岡\n 加利福尼亞\n 愛達荷\n 內華達\n 猶他\n 亞利桑那\n 蒙大拿\n 懷俄明\n 科羅拉多\n 新墨西哥\n 北達科他\n 南達科他\n 內布拉斯加\n 堪薩斯\n 俄克拉何馬\n

南卡羅萊納\n 佐治亞\n 佛羅里達\n 阿拉斯加\n 夏威夷\n \n 除夏威夷外,其餘49個州都位於美洲大陸。其中除阿拉斯加,其他48州連同華盛頓特區彼此相連,又稱美國本土。一些人將阿拉斯加也視為「本土」州,因為雖然它和「下方的48州」之間被加拿大隔離,但從地理上它仍是北美大陸的一部分。所有這些用詞通常都包括華盛頓哥倫比亞特區。第五十個州夏威夷州則位於太平洋的群島上。 \n 美國也佔有其他土地、地區和佔領區。最特別的是美國首都華盛頓哥倫比亞特區,其本身並沒有州的地位,在國會亦無代表,但在總統選舉有3張選舉人票。其他的海外島嶼領土包括美屬薩摩亞、關島、北馬利安納群島、波多黎各、和美屬維爾京群島等。帕邁拉環礁是美國唯一的合併非建制領土,但目前並無人居住。美國本土外小島嶼則由加勒比海和太平洋的許多無人居住的島嶼組成。此外,自1898年始,美國在古巴的關塔那摩灣擁有一個規模龐大的海軍基地。 \n 之前由美國佔領的地區包括巴拿馬運河區域,自1903年至1979年一直屬於美國領土。另外,菲律賓群島從1898年至1946年間也屬於美國領土,1935年美國在那裏建立了菲律賓自治邦作為轉型至完全獨立的國家前的過渡形式,最後在1946年菲律賓正式獨立,但美國仍在那裏保留軍事基地,美國和菲律賓不論在軍事、文化和經濟上關係依然密切。 \n 除了美國的實際州和領土外,有數個國家自願加入為美國的聯合邦(Associated States),包括了密克羅尼西亞聯邦(1986年以來)、帛琉(1994年以來)、以及馬紹爾群島(1986年以來),這些國家都保有國際法的主權以及對於國土的最高控制權力。不過,這些國家的政府都允許美國提供防衛和金融協助,美國也給予這些國家特殊待遇,提供許多加入美國國內政策計劃的機會,包括災害防治、救災、和重建等計劃。這些自由聯合邦都依賴美國提供的金融協助以維持政府運作和資金需求。 \n  城市[編輯]  主條目:美國城市列表 (按人口排列)和美國各州最大城市列表 \n 目前全美國有大約77%的人口居住於城市地區,其中又有半數以上集中於37座主要的大城市。這些城市也形塑了美國的文化、傳統和經濟。在2004年,全美有251個超過了10萬人的都市,以及9個超過100萬人的大都市,包括了好幾個重要的全球城市,例如紐約市、洛杉磯和芝加哥。此外,若將市中心外的都會區域也算進去的話,美國有50個超過了一百萬人的大都會。亦是每年世界最佳居住城市評選中,最多國內城市名列前茅的國家之一。

\n  發展史[編輯]  主條目:美國經濟史 \n   紐約華爾街代表了美國強大的金融力量。\n \n\n  世界上很多著名的電子科技公司都位於矽谷,它們為美國在國內及國外圴帶來龐大的利潤 \n \n\n 綜觀美國經濟史,是一個成功的從殖民地經濟逐漸過渡到在20世紀時成為世界最大的工業國的歷程。 \n 美國於19世紀末期就已超越英國成為世界第一大經濟體,至今國民一直擁有很高的生活水平,2000年代人均國民生產總值就超過四萬美元,居世界前列,是全球最富裕、經濟最發達和生活水準最高的國家之一。 \n  宏觀經濟[編輯]  經濟體系兼有資本主義和混合經濟的特徵。在這個體系內,企業和私營機構做主要的微觀經濟決策,政府在國內經濟生活中的角色較為次要;然而,各級政府的總和卻佔GDP的36%;在發達國家中,美國的社會福利網相對較小,政府對商業的管制也低於其他發達國家[113]。 \n 各地區的經濟活動重心不一。例如:紐約市是金融、航運、出版、廣播和廣告等行業的中心,也是世界名列前茅的經濟中心;洛杉磯是唱片、電影和電視節目製作中心,也是北美洲西岸以至亞太區的經濟中心;三藩市灣區和太平洋沿岸西北地區是技術開發中心,矽谷更是全球高科技和科研中心;美國中西部是重工業中心,底特律是著名的汽車城,西雅圖是飛機製造城,芝加哥是該地區的金融和商業中心;東南部以醫藥研究、旅遊業和建造業為主要產業,並且由於其薪資成本低於其他地區,因此持續的吸引製造業的投資。 \n  一座位於賓夕凡尼亞州高度機械化的牧場。農業只佔了不到1%的GDP,但仍是重要的經濟活動,特別是農業出口全世界第一,供貨不及甚至會影響國外的民生物價。\n \n\n 美國的服務業,特別是金融業、航運業、保險業以及商業服務業佔GDP占最大比重,全國四分之三的勞力從事服務業[114],而且處於世界領導地位,紐約不僅是全國第一大城市和經濟中心,更是世界數一數二的金融、服務中心。教育是美國最重要的經濟產業之一,每年吸引不少來自世界各地的留學生慕名前來求學,也為此吸納了不少人才。 \n 美國擁有豐富的礦產資源,包括黃金、石油和鈾,然而許多能源的供應都依賴於外國進口。美國是全球最大的農業出口國之一,主要農產品包括了玉米、小麥、糖和煙草,中西部大平原地區驚人的農業產量使其被譽為「世界糧倉」[115]。 \n 美國工業產品主要包括了汽車、飛機和電子產品。美國是飛機、鋼鐵、軍火和電子器材的主要輸出國。美國也有發達的旅遊業,排名世界第三[116]。 \n 美國最大的貿易夥伴是毗鄰的加拿大(19%)、中華人民共和國(12%)、墨西哥(11%)、日本(8%)緊隨其後,每天大約有價值高達11億美元的產品流經美加的國界。美國經濟被認為是世界上最大也是最重要的經濟體。美國經濟高度發達,全球多個國家的貨幣與美元掛鈎,而美國的證券市場和債劵被認為是世界經濟的晴雨表。 \n 從1980年代朗奴·列根的總統任期以來,美國增加了對新自由主義經濟政策的運用,相對減少了政府對經濟的干預、並減少福利制度的規模,拋棄了自經濟大恐慌以來長期實行的、偏向干涉主義的凱恩斯主義經濟政策。也因此,美國政府在社會福利方面提供的服務比其他工業化國家都要少,降低國內的稅賦,並更依賴於自由市場和私營的慈善機構上。縱使新自由主義所帶來的經濟寬鬆為工業的發展帶來了好處,由這種經濟制度衍生的財團壟斷問題,不平等競爭問題,以及最低薪資問題都一再成為社會的爭議焦點,往往是國會選舉與總統大選時期的爭議話題之一。 \n 1990年代,電腦及互聯網的普及令美國進入前所未有的繁榮及全球科技的領先地位。21世紀初,互聯網經濟泡沫破滅,導致美國經濟從高速增長陷入持久低速增長。雖然美國經濟在2003年後恢復較好的成長局面,但於2007年又爆發次級房貸風暴,令美國及整個世界經濟受到嚴重打擊,且美國金融與經濟的威信一落千丈,並且以美元計算國際黃金和原油的地位也被拿出來討論,隨後到2008年,美國次級房貸風暴演變成金融危機席捲全球,導致金融海嘯波及各國經濟,令全球的金融業、房地產、汽車業、奢侈品、與民間實質消費的成長嚴重下跌,尤其是英美為首的發達國家。目前已經逐漸進入後金融海嘯時代,經濟的模式與未來的重新檢討與改革正逐漸明朗,但不確定性相當高(大量印製鈔票),儘管如此,但美國經濟的份量仍是相當的高。 \n  工業[編輯]  美國是世界第一大工業國,工業門類齊全且生產技術先進。傳統工業部門有鋼鐵、汽車、化工、石油、飛機、機械、造船、電力、採礦、冶金、印刷、紡織、製藥、食品、軍火等。汽車產量和發電量均佔世界的1/5以上。石油不輸出。新興工業部門有電子電器、光電、雷射、精密機械、宇航、核能、新能源、機械人、新型材料、生物製藥、高速鐵路系統、尖端武器等。其中電子電器、光電、宇航、核能、生物製藥及尖端武器等工業居世界領先水平。 \n  農業[編輯]  美國是世界第二大農業國,足見其具備農業生產的大多優良條件:世界第四大河密西西比河縱貫南北,平原面積佔國土面積的近一半,耕地面積佔世界的十分之一;緯度適中,國土遼闊,氣候類型齊全;三面臨海(西臨太平洋、東臨大西洋、南臨墨西哥灣),並有多處太平洋島嶼的漁場,北方有五大湖,南方多降雨,西部有高山雪水,充足的水資源可供灌溉與魚蝦養殖;經濟發達,農業生產技術先進;交通發達;農作物品種優良等。美國的小麥、大豆、玉米、棉花、煙草、肉蛋奶產量均名列前茅,其中小麥產量佔世界的近十分之一;大豆和玉米均佔40%左右,畜牧業極盛,而且大量可供人類食用的糧食在美國是作為牲畜飼料使用的,儘管是人均消耗肉類與浪費食物最多的國家,但因為產量極為驚人,剩餘的糧食出口和外銷依舊達到世界第一之譜。但值得注意的是美國本土並沒有熱帶分佈,因而需要大量進口可可、咖啡、天然橡膠、香蕉等熱帶作物,美國產熱帶水果可以透過電腦控制環境的溫室栽培,美國國內超過一半的水果都在科技發達的加利福尼亞州產出。此外不單只看務農的經濟收入,由於高度機械與科技化,如果將諸如農機、冷凍、裝銷、生物科技、環境工程等附屬產業加疊起來,實際上可形成相當可觀的數字,例如在美國的孟山都公司雖然是化學工廠,但也涉及醫藥領域,甚至同時經營氣象等業務,這種分工精密而先驅的生產體系遍佈各產業,讓產值得以變得極高,生產成本又不斷下探,這種「西裝革履的牧人」、「實驗室的農夫」乃是美國公事包農業的特色。 \n  科學技術[編輯]  主條目:美國科技 \n   哥倫比亞號穿梭機發射,並執行載人任務。\n \n\n 美國在科學和技術研究,以及技術產品創新方面都是世界首屈一指。同時美國擁有世界上絕多數的核心科技,所以美國相對於別國的科技的發展一直佔優。 \n 人類工業史上許多最重要的發明,包括了軋棉機、通用零件、生產線等都是源自美國,其中工業的生產線尤其重要,它使得工業的「大量生產」從夢想變為真實。其他重要的發明還包括飛機、電燈泡、電話。 \n 美國在20世紀開展了著名的曼哈頓原子彈計劃、阿波羅登月計劃和人類基因組計劃。在二戰時期,美國最早研製出原子彈,將人類科技帶入原子時代的新紀元。在冷戰時期,美國最終在太空科學和技術領域全面領先,從而在太空競賽中擊敗蘇聯,也從而導致了火箭技術、武器研究、材料科學和計算機等領域的重大進步,1969年7月,當尼爾·阿姆斯特朗從阿波羅11號飛船中走出,成為踏上月球的第一人時,標誌着競賽達到巔峰。 \n 二戰以來,美國為電腦與互聯網發展史上貢獻至豐,包括二戰中發明的電腦和初期的軍事化應用,到今日以谷歌、微軟、IBM、英特爾、蘋果、惠普和戴爾等為代表的一大批知名公司都為電腦和資訊化領域做出了巨大的革新和貢獻。此外美國國防部創辦的ARPA網也是網絡技術的先驅。 \n 在科學研究方面,美國學者贏得了顯著大量的諾貝爾獎,特別是在生物和醫學領域,充份彰顯美國優越的研究環境以及對一流人才的磁吸能力。國立衛生研究院是美國生物醫學的聚焦點,並已完成人類基因組計劃,使人類對腫瘤、阿茲海默病等疾病的治癒研究進入重要階段[117]。航空和航天研究的政府機構是美國太空總署。波音公司和洛歇·馬丁公司之類的私營企業也扮演了十分重要的角色。 \n  交通運輸[編輯]   美國的州際公路系統網,大多屬高速公路,全線至少四線行車。\n \n\n 由於美國的國土較為遼闊且三面臨海加之經濟發達,使得其許多交通方式的運輸技術與運量均居世界首位。公路、鐵路的密度處世界領先水平,高速鐵路建設則因為航空業的優勢巨大,遠遜於居世界領先水平的國家。航空港和港口數量居世界前列。因旅客鐵路網的相應限制,美國國內通勤旅客最常使用的長途旅行方式以駕駛與航空為主。 \n  公路[編輯]  由於汽車產業在美國的發展相當早,美國許多城市的發展都提前顧慮到將城市和住宅區搭配道路網絡的設計。為連結遼闊的國土,美國設計並建造了高通行量、高速度的高速公路,美國的國家交通系統主要便是依賴這些高速公路網。當中最重要的是州際高速公路系統的建設。這些高速公路在1950年代經由當時的總統艾森豪威爾授權建造。根據2004年的數據,美國的公路總長為6,407,637公里,名列世界第一。 \n   洛杉磯的高速公路交流道系統,有着相當複雜而且運作良好的道路網絡,為世界各國經常進行參考的對象。\n \n\n 在殖民地時代,美國多數地區遵行左駛規則。美國獨立後,受支持其獨立的法國和後來的18世紀歐洲移民的影響[118],逐漸將道路通行方向改為右駛,此規則在美國內戰之後通行於全國。 \n  鐵路[編輯]  美國建造了橫貫大陸的鐵路網絡,用以在48個州之間運載貨物。美國鐵路公司(Amtrak)所經營的鐵路網也橫貫了48個州中的46個,專門用於客運用途。美國的鐵路總長度位居世界第一[119]。根據2007年的數據,美國的鐵路總長為226,427公里。然而由於美國高速公路及民航客運十分發達,其機動性及省時性均遠高於鐵路,使得美國的鐵路客運不及西歐和日本那般發達。美國政府的分析認為空中客運是導致客運鐵路公司在1970年代接連倒閉的主因。然而隨着時代的變遷,發展大眾運輸已經是全世界對抗全球暖化而達成一致的共識。包括由加利福尼亞州所提案發展的加利福尼亞高速鐵路計劃在內,美國政府以及各州政府已經開始了大眾鐵路運輸的可行性研究與籌備工作,為未來交通形態的轉型作準備。 \n  城市交通[編輯]  美國許多城市擁有公共交通系統,而在紐約市的地鐵網絡是當中最大的,每日通勤人次為世界第二高,僅次於日本東京地鐵,而其通勤鐵路和公車網絡則延伸至長島、紐約上州、新澤西州和康涅狄格州,構成了世界上載客量最大的交通網之一。但是普遍而言,美國城市的公共交通相較於其他發達國家仍較為落後,除了少數如紐約、芝加哥及三藩市等公共運輸較發達的都會區外,人們外出時最常依賴的運輸模式仍然是以私人汽車為主。 \n  水運[編輯]   由紐約市以西的紐瓦克港眺望曼哈頓。\n \n\n 美國是世界上海岸線第三長的國家,故形成了眾多優良港口。大西洋西岸的紐約港,墨西哥灣北岸的侯斯頓港,以及太平洋東岸的洛杉磯港(長灘港)是美國最大的三個國際貨物港口,同時也是吞吐量居世界前列的頂級大港。縱貫美國南北的密西西比河航運量居世界河流前三名,加之其上游通過運河與五大湖及哈得孫河相連,內河航運十分便利。座落在密芝根湖南岸的美國第三大城市芝加哥為著名的內陸港口。 \n  航空[編輯]   哈茨菲爾德-傑克遜國際機場夜景\n \n\n 美國是人類發明出首架飛機並首次實現飛行的國家,對於擁有遼闊國土且經濟發達的美國,自然的成為國內航線最發達的國家,特別是由於客運鐵路的缺乏,數百哩以上的旅程,國內各地區長途交通幾乎全依賴飛機。以乘坐飛機的形式前往另一個城市,對美國人如同家常便飯。因此全國遍佈有一萬五千個以上的機場,是機場最密集的國家,佔據全球總數的25%。以乘客量而言,在2004年全世界前30個最繁忙的機場中就有17個位於美國,包括了排名第一的亞特蘭大哈茲菲爾德-傑克遜國際機場。以運貨量而言,在同一年裏,全世界前30個最繁忙的貨運機場就有12個在美國,包括了排名第一的孟菲斯國際機場(MEM)。此外,芝加哥、三藩市(聖弗朗西斯科)、西雅圖、侯斯頓、邁阿密、華盛頓等也為重要的航空港。正因為美國在全球航空業的分量之重,美國聯邦航空總署(FAA)所頒佈的規定甚至成為了全世界航空業的另一個參考標準。 \n  旅遊[編輯]  儘管美國建國的歷史只有200多年,但發達的國民經濟和舉世無雙的現代文明加之瑰麗旖旎的自然風光使得其成為旅遊強國。被譽為世界第一大都市的紐約、尖端建築雲集的芝加哥、歷史文化名城三藩市(聖弗朗西斯科)、天使之城洛杉磯、首都華盛頓、賭城拉斯維加斯等。自然景觀的黃石公園、科羅拉多大峽谷、鹽湖城、奧林匹克國家公園、五大湖風景區、夏威夷群島、神秘的阿拉斯加州等都是長年旅遊業經久不衰的旅遊目的地。而迪士尼樂園、環球影城、美國太空總署等等極具魅力的建設也吸引大量的觀光收入。 \n  對外貿易[編輯]   以28種顏色分類描述此國的產品出口,每種顏色盒代表一類產品,其大小代表此產品在此國總出口產品中的比重。\n \n\n 美國是世界第二大貿易國,世界最大進口國,世界第二大出口國。美國是小麥、玉米、大豆的最大出口國。同時也是航空、電子、化工類產品的主要出口國。此外,美國還是世界最大的軍火出口國。美國主要進口的商品有化石能源、電力、工業原材料、一般工業製成品、橡膠、可可、咖啡等。美國的主要貿易對象有加拿大、中國、日本、墨西哥、德國、英國、法國、沙特阿拉伯、印度、韓國、巴西等。其中,加拿大和中國為美國最重要的兩個貿易夥伴國。 \n  人口[編輯]  主條目:美國人口 \n  歷史[編輯]  主條目:美國人口歷史 \n 在1880年到1900年間,美國的城市人口比率從28%上升到40%,1920年達到50%,部分是由於歐洲移民的緣故。在1890年後,美國的農村人口由於機器化的普及使得農民的工作被機器取代而移居到城市的影響成垂直下降趨勢。 \n  現狀[編輯]  主條目:美國各州人口列表 \n  2000年美國人口密集度分佈圖。\n \n\n  來源國家族群分佈,2000\n \n\n 根據美國人口普查局在2017年底統計資料,美國總人口數為321,004,407人,若以只能選擇單一族群勾選的情況下,美國白人佔73%,人數為234,370,202人,其中,沒有西班牙血統或拉丁裔美國人背景的白人佔61.5%,人數為197,277,729人,有西班牙血統或拉丁裔美國人背景的白人佔11.5%,人數為37,092,473人。 \n 有西班牙血統及有拉丁美洲背景的拉丁裔美國人佔總人口的17.6%,人口爲56,510,571人,其中,自我認同爲白人者,佔11.5%,人數為37,092,473人,其他非白人的拉丁裔美國人佔6.1%,人數為19,418,098人。 \n 非裔美國人佔總人口的12.7%,人數為40,610,815人。 \n 亞裔美國人佔總人口的5.4%,人數為17,186,320人,其中最大的亞裔群體為華裔美國人(包括來自中國大陸、香港、澳門、新加坡、臺灣、東南亞的華人),佔1.3%,人數為4,108,085人,其次則是印度人,佔1.1%,人數為3,672,647人。 \n 美國原住民如印第安人、阿拉斯加原住民佔總人口的0.8%,人數為2,622,102人。 \n 美國在太平洋的領土上的原住民(簡稱:太平洋島民)佔總人口的0.2%,人數為570,116人。 \n \n 截止到2010年,美國人口總計已達到3.08億,是世界上人口僅次於中國、印度的人口第三大國,人口增長率為0.59%。其中,非西班牙裔白人佔64%,其餘分別為拉丁裔美國人、非洲裔、亞裔等。從各州情況來看,加利福尼亞州是美國人口最多的州,為3720萬;懷俄明州人口最少,只有56.4萬;德薩斯州人口絕對數量增長最多,比2000年增加430萬,達到2510萬。美國黑人、拉丁裔美國人和亞裔等少數族裔總人口已達到1.007億人(截至2006年7月),美國的拉丁裔美國人人口突破5000萬,佔美國人口約六分之一(16.66%),繼續穩居美國頭號少數族裔位置。美國華裔人口約400萬(截至2011年)。通用英語。其中約300萬人能夠說漢語。51.3%的居民信奉基督新教,其他居民信奉天主教、猶太教等,不屬於任何教派的佔4%。 \n 依據2000年的人口普查,大約有79%的人口居住於都市,美國是一個種族差異巨大的多民族國家,全國有31個民族(或者說是種族)超過了一百萬人,一百萬人以下的民族還有更多。 \n 大多數的美國人(在2004年有74.67%)是歐洲白人移民的後代,這些移民當時在首批殖民地安居,許多是在內戰後的「南部重建運動」中來到美國的,由於非白人的移民以及少數族群的高出生率的緣故,非拉丁裔美國人的白人比率正在逐漸下跌。 \n 主要的歐洲原籍是德國(15.6%)、愛爾蘭(10.8%)、英格蘭(8.7%)、意大利(5.6%)和斯堪的納維亞(3.7%);很多也來自斯拉夫國家,如波蘭和俄羅斯等;其他的歐裔移民來自東歐、南歐和加拿大的法語區。 \n 美國原住民如印第安人則有440萬人,其中約有35%居住在政府規劃的原住民保留區。 \n 亞裔美國人(不包括夏威夷人和太平洋島嶼住民)是第三大的少數族裔,2005年普查中佔到5%。大多數亞裔美國人集中在西海岸和夏威夷,亞裔中最大的族群來自包括中國大陸、香港、澳門、新加坡、臺灣、東南亞的華人所組成的華裔美國人,其次依序為印度、菲律賓、越南、韓國和日本。 \n 拉丁裔美國人是美國第一大的種族族群,佔總人口的16.1%(2005年),之中自墨西哥移民而來的佔了66%,並且預計在將來幾十年中仍會高速增長。 \n 非裔美國人遍佈全美,不過南方的黑人區為最大,合計3,500萬人(12.12%)。他們的祖先主要是在內戰以前被作為奴隸販賣過來的。 \n 2011年6月28日,美國企業研究所(AEI)發表一項愛國精神調查報告顯示,逾6成民眾(有61%的受訪者以身為美國人感到「非常自豪」,25%受訪者感到「很自豪」)以身為美國人深感自豪,且大多數美國人認為從軍是愛國的一種表現,美國民眾普遍對美國軍隊評價高。 \n  社會階層[編輯]  主條目:美國社會階層 \n 2004年美國社會學家Leonard Beeghley調查出的五類美國社會階層分佈如下,收入單位都是美元: \n  位於加州聖荷西郊區的一片中產家庭聚集區\n \n\n 按照個人或家庭收入高低所形成的社會階層來看,明顯得出個人受教育程度與之關係密切,2005年美國全體家庭的年收入中位數為46326美元,而18%的家庭收數超過10萬美元,而個人年收入的中位數則為32,140美元(僅計算25歲以上的個人)。擁有較罕見的工作技巧,或從事社會上普遍認為較為重要工作的人,也是較高社會地位的人,而這些人通常有較高的個人收入:具有專業與博士學位的人的收入是美國收入前15%的主要組成部分,前15%的收入者平均賺取62,500美元以上;而具有大學學士學位的人的收入居於中產行列,他們大多屬於是中產階層[130]。 \n  語言[編輯]  主條目:美國英語 \n   美國居家使用的超過100萬人口的語言\n2010年[131]    語言 占人口百分比 人數     英語(只講英語)  80% 233,780,338    除英語外的其他語言 20% 57,048,617    西班牙語\n(不包括波多黎各和克里奧爾語)  12% 35,437,985     漢語\n(包括現代標準漢語和所有漢語方言)  0.9% 2,567,779    他加祿語 0.5% 1,542,118    越南語 0.4% 1,292,448    法語 0.4% 1,288,833    韓語 0.4% 1,108,408    德語 0.4% 1,107,869     \n 雖然美國沒有法定官方語言,英語卻是事實上的國家語言。據2008年統計,約3億1480萬(99.6%)的五歲以上人口在家只說英語。英語是最通用的交流語言,掌握一定程度的英語也是移民歸化的要求之一。 \n 一些美國人呼籲把英語提升為官方語言,有28個州已經通過地方法律確保英語的官方地位;有3個州承認其他語言與英語有平行地位:路易斯安那州的法語,夏威夷州的夏威夷語和新墨西哥州的西班牙語。 \n 除英語外,使用人口超過100萬人的語言包括西班牙語、漢語、塔加洛語、越南語、法語、韓語、德語。[131]\n  宗教[編輯]   一座位於北卡羅萊納州的美南浸信會教堂。南部聖經地帶的新教徒人口極多,是美國最為虔誠的地區之一。\n \n\n 主條目:美國宗教 \n 美國建國前的英國殖民地時期,沒有宗教自由,當時存在非常嚴酷的宗教法令,對不信仰基督新教的人進行歧視、迫害,主要針對天主教徒(部分基於反教權主義)而且基督宗教各派別控制的地區對其它派別的教徒也實行歧視政策。 \n 美國建國後,美國憲法第一修正案於1791年通過,禁止美國國會立法設立國教,美國成為首個明文保障宗教自由權利的國家,美國聯邦政府實行政教分離制度,不能支持也不能反對任何一種宗教。但正是因為保障宗教自由發展,基督教的勢力自建國後開始在美國蓬勃發展,並在美國政治選舉中有相當的影響力,除約翰·甘迺迪為天主教徒外,歷屆美國總統都是基督新教信徒。 \n 2007年的官方估計數字[133]: \n 在所有發達國家中,美國是宗教氣氛最濃厚的一個國家。不過美國各州分佈的情況很不相同。美國虔誠保守的基督徒多分佈於南部和中西部各州,多是共和黨的支持者,南部黑人區、東北部和西部沿海各州的基督徒也多持開明態度,多是民主黨的支持者。 \n 南方州中,美南浸信會是最大的教派,其後是衛理公會;而在東北紐英倫地區和南部接近墨西哥的邊境地帶中,天主教是佔主導地位,因為當地的人口很多都是歐洲天主教地區(如德國南部巴伐利亞、愛爾蘭、意大利和波蘭)移民的後裔,或者是北美洲其他地方(如魁北克和波多黎各)移民的後裔,南部則主要是來自墨西哥的拉美裔移民。美國其他的大部分地區的基督教人口則都是多種教派混合在一起。儘管大多數美國基督徒信奉新教,但因為新教徒往往屬於各個不同的教派,因此天主教會擁有最多的成員,而天主教徒隨着更多的拉美裔移民增加而有所增加,而他們的高生育率亦有助增加美國的基督徒數量,特別是天主教會。摩門教的勢力也不容小覷。 \n  社會與生活[編輯]   居民收入[編輯]  主條目:美國各州國內生產總值列表 \n 參見:美國貧困問題 \n 美國的人均收入名列世界前茅,全國的人均年收入是4.7萬美元[134]。這些指標接近後工業化國,如瑞士(5.4萬美元),但財富在發達國家中相對集中,與分配更加公平的西歐和澳洲相比,40%的人口相對更為貧困,僅獲得1%,而前20%的人則更富裕,佔有70%的經濟成果[135],尤其是其中前1%,能分配到國家財富的40%之多。自1975年以來,社會流動程度較低,勞動力市場兩極化,經濟增長的成果流向收入較高的20%的家庭[136]。 \n 美國的居民家庭收入水平較高,但各州之間也存在着顯著差距,比如西維珍尼亞州的中間家庭收入為3.3萬美元,而新罕布什爾州則高達5.7萬美元[137][138],一般則都介於英國(45575美元)[139]和新西蘭(30256美元)兩者之間[140]。 \n 中等收入群的長期工資趨勢自1970年代一直陷入停滯,而低收入者的總體收入在下降,雖然時均勞動生產率業已大幅提高。美國各州最低工資標準普遍在時薪7-8美元左右,大約只有西歐以及澳洲標準的一半。[141]非法移民所得的低工資使之成為最貧困的10%勞動力,[143]然而肉類包裝業和農業之類的產業大量依賴於非法勞工。[144]在2005年的一份來自美國勞工部的報告中說,自1960年代以來,工資佔國民GDP的比例之低和企業盈利水平之高同時創了歷史紀錄[145]。 \n 女權主義運動帶來了美國和歐洲女性就業率的大幅度上升。1950年代美國婚後女性就業率僅為11%,甚至少於1920年代。[146]經歷了在1960年代、1970年代伴隨着帶有濃烈地左翼色彩的民權運動而出現的的女權運動高潮後,1978年美國已婚女性就業率上升到50%。1997年達到61%,在1990年到21世紀初的頭幾年的經濟繁榮期時,認同「返回家庭相夫教子」的「選擇女權主義」逐漸回潮,[147]已婚女性就業率曾經回落到54%,[148]在2008年底世界金融危機爆發後,因為生活壓力增大所迫,美國已婚女性就業率重新上揚[149],只是性別收入並不平等,女性薪水一直低於男性,男性從業者的工作傷害也更多。而此現象僅非洲裔除外,原因是因為黑人青年衝動未婚生子或父親坐牢因素,單親媽媽需要養孩子而必須工作的比例較高。 \n  醫療保健[編輯]  主條目:美國醫療系統 \n 根據世界衛生組織1997年的醫療系統總體表現排名,美國在世衛組織會員國中名列第15位。[150]以占國民總產值比例和人均花費指標衡量,美國在健康方面的花費(私人和公共花費共計)遠超其他國家。[151]然而,如此高的支出並未提供水準相應的公共健康保障。中央情報局世界概況的資料表明,美國與其他西方工業化國家相比,嬰兒死亡率較高,國民平均壽命略低於瑞典和法國[153][154]等國。美國醫生的平均工資是世界最高的。[155]但肥胖症仍是公共衛生難題,估計造成的年度醫療開支達數百億美元。在統計上美國中低收入者肥胖比率偏高。[156]\n 與其他西方國家不同,美國保健制度不是完全公費,而是公私共同支付,美國並無全民健保,美國總統克林頓任內其妻希拉里曾花費許多心力想建立全民健保,讓美國人人有醫療保險,然而卻被國會與利益團體否決掉。據2004年資料,個人健康花費中私營保險業支付佔36%,個人佔15%,聯邦、州和地方政府佔44%。[157]在2005年,4120萬居民(美國總人口的14.2%)至少在該年度的某一段時間沒有醫療保險;不過其中三分之一家庭收入超過5萬美元,而這類人口又有一半人收入超過7.5萬美元。[158]另外,夠資格加入公費醫療保險的人有三分之一未加入。醫療保險在美國傳統上屬於僱員福利。同時,無論病人是否有能力支付費用,醫院必須提供急診服務,然而急診之後醫院可趕走付不出錢的病人。在美國,醫藥費是導致個人破產的最大因素。[159]美國在醫療研究投入了巨額資金,大多數為私人投資。據2000年統計,私營非盈利機構投入佔7%,私營企業佔57%,稅金支持的國立衛生研究院佔36%。[160]\n  教育[編輯]    哈佛法學院圖書館傍晚景色\n \n\n   麻省理工學院的電腦科學中心。\n \n\n 主條目:美國教育、美國高等教育和美國大學列表 \n 在美國,教育管理是州或地方政府的責任,而非聯邦政府[161]。不過,聯邦政府教育部可以通過控制教育基金來施加一定程度的影響。學生有法定義務在公立學校接受從小學到12年級的教育;即小學五年、初中三年,高中四年,分公立、私立兩種,大部分是公立學校,實行免費義務教育制。另外,中小學校一般免費或半費供應午餐,學生由校車定點接送。通常,18歲才可以畢業,但是許多州允許16歲以上的學生離校。除了上公立學校,家長也可以選擇在家教育孩子[163],或送他們去教會或私立學校。高中畢業後,學生們可以選擇上公立或私立大學。公立大學從聯邦或州政府接受經費,也接受其他途徑的資金,但大多數的學生在畢業後仍需償還學生貸款。私立大學的學費通常比公立大學還高。許多學生會在進入大學和學院前進入職場或軍隊以賺取學費,美軍和許多私人企業也會補貼職員的高等教育學費。[164][165]\n 美國有很多大學。從360多年前移民美國清教徒於1636年9月創建了全美的第一所大學——哈佛大學[166]後,美國的高等教育繼承了歐洲古老大學如英國的劍橋大學及牛津大學的傳統。發展到今天已有2600多所頒發學士、碩士和博士學位的四年制大學[167]。而兩年制的社區學院則多達3400所。 \n 2009年聯合國開發計劃署的人類發展指數中的教育指數[168]將美國的教育水準列為世界第21。目前有7660萬的美國人正在接受教育(從幼稚園直到大學都包括在內)[169]。美國的許多高等院校也非常有競爭力,無論是公立或私立的。全美保守估計有約3400所大學[170]。著名高校包括常春藤盟校成員,另也有史丹福大學及麻省理工學院等等,為全球最重要的教育樞紐,每年吸引不少來自世界各地的留學生慕名前來升學。 \n  飲食[編輯]    蘋果派為美國最著名的甜品 \n \n\n  在美國,每逢節日,人們會吃火雞 \n \n\n 主條目:美國烹飪 \n 美國飲食吸收了美國原住民的烹飪法和食材,例如火雞、馬鈴薯、玉米、南瓜,這些都成了美國文化不可或缺的一部分。而蘋果派、比薩餅、漢堡包原先都是來自或改良自歐洲,現在則是美國快餐文化的象徵。墨西哥捲和炸玉米餅(tacos)則源自墨西哥。由非裔美國人在身為奴隸時從非洲引入的「心靈食物(Soul food(英語:Soul food))」也成了大眾的家常菜之一。整體而言,由於大量攝入高熱量食物,美國的飲食結構不太健康,國內肥胖問題非常嚴重。 \n 美國人的飲食習慣常是一日三餐。早餐時間大約在早上7點到8點。早餐內容各地自有差別。一頓簡單的早飯,可能為果汁、牛奶、麥片、烤麵包以及咖啡等簡便食品。早餐通常在家裏用餐,不過也有時候借早餐的機會來討論業務等商業活動,稱為「工作早餐」。午餐的時間基本在中午12點至下午2點。因為時間短且人們離家不見得近,所以學生與上班族很少回家吃飯,而是從家裏帶餐點來,故相比較而言美國人的午餐是三餐中最簡單的,生蔬菜沙律、三明治、漢堡或餡餅、熱狗等,再來一杯飲料。晚餐在傍晚6點至7點左右開始,一般都比較豐富,所以在美式英語中晚餐也有正餐、大餐的意思。在晚餐時一般都會先來一份果汁或是濃湯,然後再上主菜。常擺在餐桌上的主菜有牛排、豬排、烤牛腩、炸雞、炸蝦、火腿和烤羊排等。多數的美國人喜歡在享用完晚飯後再來一些甜食,比如蛋糕、雪糕和巧克力。在周末或假日,許多家庭只吃兩頓飯。他們把早飯和午飯和在一起吃叫做早午餐,由早餐和午餐相加而得。一般比較正式。有的家庭星期天不做飯,全家去餐館用餐。在一些美國節日,美國家庭也時常舉行野餐和戶外烤肉。 \n  傳媒[編輯]  主條目:美國媒體 \n 美國是個新聞自由高的國家,這源於美國憲法對公民自由的嚴格保護[171]。加之經濟的高度發達和激烈的市場競爭,使得美國成為世界上傳播媒介系統最發達的國家。美國媒體涵蓋了所有主要的形式,包括電視、廣播、報紙、雜誌和互聯網。大多數媒體都屬於商業化的私有媒體公司,他們依靠廣告、訂閱以及出售版權盈利。 \n 美國三大傳媒公司為時代華納(擁有有線電視新聞網、家庭影院頻道、時代周刊和華納兄弟電視網等品牌)、新聞集團(擁有福克斯廣播公司、華爾街日報和紐約郵報)和迪士尼(擁有美國廣播公司)。 \n  電視[編輯]  全美的地方電視台有幾千家,其中絕大多數分別從屬於七大私營全國無線電視網:傳統的三大電視網——全國廣播公司、美國廣播公司和哥倫比亞廣播公司[173],以及近些年迅速崛起的四大電視網——福斯廣播公司、聯合派拉蒙電視網(UPN)、華納兄弟電視網(WB)和帕克斯電視網(PAX)。 \n 除上述無線電視網之外,美國還有很多有線電視頻道,其中以播放電影、原創的電視影片、紀錄片的家庭影院頻道和全球第一個設置全天24小時新聞頻道的有線電視新聞網的實力最為雄厚,這兩家皆為時代華納公司所擁有。更值得提的是CNN.com是互聯網歷史上的第一個新聞網站(1995年8月30日建立),目前全球212個國家和地區的大約10億人可以收看到CNN節目。ABC公司還經營調幅和調頻廣播電台,並有多座附屬廣播電台。主要劇目:波士頓法律,三軍統帥(Command in Chief) 等。 \n  廣播電台[編輯]  美國的廣播有兩種制式,分別是調頻和調幅。美國最常見的兩類電台分別是談話台和音樂台,其中音樂台所佔比重很大,分類也十分細緻。 \n 大多數的美國電台都是私營的商業電台。全國公共廣播電台則是美國最大的公共廣播網絡。 \n  報紙[編輯]   《紐約時報》標題\n \n\n 絕大多數美國的報紙都是私營的,廣告收入是主要經濟來源。影響力最大的是《紐約時報》,該報被譽為「美國社會的忠實記錄」,其新聞報道的視角遍及全國各個方面,深受學者和專家們的喜愛。以商業、金融報道為主的《華爾街日報》和西部的《洛杉磯時報》的影響力也很大,但兩者在新聞界的地位不及《紐約時報》。《今日美國》雖然有逾百萬銷量,但只關注娛樂、體育等領域的話題,缺乏主流媒體應有的嚴肅性,其影響力遠不及上面三大報。這四種報是美國發行量最大的報紙,它們都在全美大多數城市發行。 \n  雜誌[編輯]   1923年3月2日《時代》創刊封面\n \n\n 美國的雜誌業非常發達,雜誌的類型和內容非常豐富,主要雜誌在美國任何一座大城市的報攤上都可以買到。絕大多數雜誌社都隸屬於某個大型媒體公司旗下。 \n 美國三大主流新聞類周刊: \n 其他雜誌主要有: \n  互聯網[編輯]  參見:互聯網歷史 \n 正如互聯網是發源於美國一樣,美國也自然是網絡最豐富和發達的國家。主流傳媒公司基本上都有自己的網站,有些是完全免費的,而有一些則只部分免費。 \n 美國人創辦的網站如Facebook、Amazon、Google、Wikipedia、YouTube和Twitter都是全球訪問和使用人數最多的網站。隨身智能移動終端的時代來臨後,諸如Instagram以及Pinterest等等的互聯網平台也獲得了世界範圍內普遍的人氣。 \n 美國是一個互聯網高度自由的國家,網絡言論受《美國憲法第一修正案》的強力保護。因此,政府審查網絡言論的情況很少出現。不過,美國也在互聯網上進行以稜鏡計劃為代表的大規模監控,因此被無國界記者列為「互聯網敵人」之一。 \n  治安[編輯]    已發展國家之間的兇殺案發生率排名,美國在這方面遠超過歐盟與許多西歐地區的國家。\n \n\n 治安主要由當地警察局和治安部門警長負責,州警提供邊境服務。聯邦部門如聯邦調查局和美國法警具有各自的職責範圍。聯邦和州法採用普通法審理案件。州法院審理大多數犯罪案件,聯邦法院審理特定的罪案和受理上訴案。 \n 在發達國家行列中,美國的暴力犯罪尤其是使用槍支實施暴力和兇殺的犯罪率一直都高於其他發達國家[174]。2007年平均每10萬人有5.6名兇手[175],這一數據是鄰國加拿大的三倍[176]。美國的兇殺率於1991年到1999年增長了42%,目前形勢大體穩定[175]。因此槍支擁有權也成為美國政治辯論中的一大話題。 \n 美國擁有全球最高記錄的監禁率[177]和最多的囚犯數[178]。2008年初有超過230萬人處於監禁中,幾乎每100名成年人就有超過1人被關押[179]。目前的監禁率是1980年的七倍[180]。非裔美國男性的在押率是白人男性的六倍、以及西班牙和葡萄牙裔男性的三倍[177]。2006年美國的關押率是波蘭的三倍,也是經濟合作與發展組織中最高的國家[181]。這一現象主要歸因於美國聯邦的司法判決指導方針(英語:United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines)和針對毒品犯罪的政策(英語:Drug policy of the United States)[177],比如很大一部分人是因為涉及金額很小的毒品交易而入獄[183]。 \n 雖然大多數國家已經廢除了死刑,不過目前美國聯邦政府針對一些特定犯罪保留死刑,以及有34個州還保留着該制度。自1976年美國最高法院恢復實施死刑以來(之前暫停了四年),到目前已有1000多名罪犯接受了死刑[184]。2006年,美國實施死刑的數量居全球第六,位列中國、伊朗、巴基斯坦、伊拉克和蘇丹之後[185]。2007年新澤西州成為1976年以來第一個廢除死刑的州,此後新墨西哥州於2009年以及伊利諾州於2011年也相繼廢除了死刑[186]。 \n  節日[編輯]  主條目:美國節日 \n 聯邦法定假日如下: \n   日期 節日名稱 註明    1月1日 New Year 慶祝新年的到來    1月的第三個星期一 馬丁·路德·金紀念日 紀念民權運動領袖馬丁·路德·金牧師的生日(1929年1月15日),1986年開始實施。    1月20日 就職日

美國革命期間,美國與一些歐洲國家建立了外交關係,說服了法國、西班牙以及荷蘭協助對抗英國。在接下來的開墾年代裏,美國一直在親法或親英兩個選擇間搖擺不定。當時美國對歐洲事務不願插手,專注於北美的疆土開拓。 \n 後來美國以門羅主義削弱了歐洲在拉丁美洲的影響力,以確保自己在美洲地區事務的支配權。美國的擴張政策陸續引發了與墨西哥和西班牙的戰爭,兩戰均以美國的勝利告終。在南北戰爭中,美國指責英國和法國支援南部分裂的美利堅聯盟國,並試圖入侵墨西哥。但在內戰結束後,美國在北美洲的主導地位就再未受過挑戰。 \n 隨着國力漸增,美國開始將注意力轉向海外,尤其是對外貿易的開拓。為此,美國佔領了太平洋的許多領土,包括夏威夷、菲律賓,並與歐洲列強競爭在中國的影響力。第二次世界大戰後,美國在聯合國的創建上扮演了重要角色,並且成為安全理事會的五名永久會員之一。 \n 冷戰期間,美國最初試圖限制蘇聯於世界各地的影響力。為了對抗蘇聯,美國、加拿大和10個歐洲國家共同建立了北大西洋公約組織,以聯合盟國對抗任何針對北美和歐洲的軍事行動,後來又有14個歐洲國家陸續加入了這一共同防禦聯盟,包括土耳其和一些前華沙條約成員國以及部分前蘇聯加盟共和國。出於政治上的現實考量,美國也與共産主義陣營中部分社會主義國家結成戰略夥伴,例如中蘇交惡後的中華人民共和國。 \n 近年來,由於蘇聯解體,美國失去全球戰略對手,更加關注自身邊界安全,防止非法移民和非法毒品進入國內——尤其是針對墨西哥和加勒比海國家。[187]美國也充分利用冷戰後的全球領導地位,基於國家利益和民主自由價值觀,打擊恐怖主義、邪惡軸心國家和避免大規模殺傷性武器的擴散,其主要目標為維護國家利益,被認為有干涉主義的性質。近年由於中國在經濟和軍事上迅速發展,美國逐漸加強在亞洲的軍事部署。 \n  現狀[編輯]   美國為深綠色,北約盟友為綠色,美國的其他盟友為淺綠色,「邪惡軸心」為紅色\n \n\n 美國具有全球性的經濟、政治和軍事影響力,其外交政策走向一直是世界關注和討論的焦點。美國的外交關係規模是全世界最為龐大的。幾乎所有的國家在華盛頓特區都設有大使館和派駐大使。 \n 在西方世界方面,英國、加拿大、澳洲,均被視為是美國最親密的盟友。亞洲方面,在二戰後,日本、大韓民國和以色列均與美國有極緊密的外交關係,日、韓兩地更有美軍駐兵(參見駐日美軍、駐韓美軍)[188]。 \n 目前世界上只有朝鮮、伊朗、敘利亞和不丹四國未與美國建立外交關係。2015年時任美國總統奧巴馬訪問古巴後,古巴與美國恢復兩國中斷超過50年的外交關係,同時美國也是世界上少數不承認朝鮮的國家之一。 \n 但在中東及伊斯蘭社會冷戰後的美國外交一直不被看好,甚至常年被媒體評論為失敗,從巴以問題一直僵持不下,又911事件開始再到阿富汗戰爭、伊拉克戰爭的戰爭泥潭,阿拉伯之春變成阿拉伯之冬,經歷動盪的利比亞和敘利亞乃至埃及、黎巴嫩至今局勢還沒有穩定下來,這導致了中東地區的20多個國家的反美浪潮愈演愈烈。而美國的外交政策也實在讓人難以捉摸。據有關信息指出,美國政府在明知恐怖組織的威脅性下,仍然放手不管,導致了如今ISIS對中東威脅的加重。[189][190]\n  軍事[編輯]   美國海軍環太平洋演習中的3個航母戰鬥群\n \n\n   美國因擁有世界上最強大的海軍和空軍,而令其在地球上每個角落有壓倒性的制海權和制空權 \n \n\n 主條目:美軍 \n 美軍的海陸空規模一直位於世界前列,而且其軍事花費己約佔全世界總軍費開銷的47%,為世界最強大的正規部隊,擁有全世界最大的核武器庫,全世界最精良的武器裝備,在近代世界軍事排名中一直保持第一。 美國軍隊分為五個軍種:由國防部管理的陸軍、海軍、空軍、海軍陸戰隊和國土安全部管理的海岸警衛隊。海岸警衛隊在和平時期由國土安全部管轄,戰爭期間歸海軍部。 \n 美軍雖於20世紀到今天經歷過一戰、二戰、韓戰、越戰、科索沃戰爭、阿富汗戰爭和伊拉克戰爭等大小戰爭,已多次參與聯合國維和行動如在海灣戰爭中將入侵科威特的伊拉克軍隊趕出科威特,但美軍因為這些戰爭、維和行動陣亡的士兵人數總和不足60萬人。 \n 美軍的軍事實力也表現在物流管理和電戰能力上,在這方面的龐大優勢使美軍能夠迅速集結部隊應付戰爭。美國空軍有C-5、C-17等巨型空運載具,並裝備先進的F-22猛禽戰鬥機及F-35閃電II戰鬥機。美國海軍有11艘現役大型航空母艦,配合軍事力量投射的原則,使美軍能對大部分的威脅做出迅速反應。美國在1949年4月4日加入地區性軍事防衛組織北大西洋公約組織,也使美國本土有了一層除美軍外的軍事保護屏障。 \n  指揮權[編輯]  美國總統是美國軍隊的最高統帥,軍隊由國防部長具體負責,軍事指揮權是在各軍種參謀長手上。由他們所組成的參謀長聯席會議制定作戰計劃並組織實施。 \n  文化[編輯]   「貓王」埃爾維斯·普雷斯利是世界現代搖滾樂的第一把交椅。直到現在,「貓王」的搖滾樂都還影響着流行音樂的譜曲\n \n\n  美國著名女星瑪麗蓮·夢露曾於40年代至60年代紅遍全球,被喻為美國的性感象徵\n \n\n 主條目:美國文化 \n 美國文化根植於英屬殖民地時期,隨着當地環境發展出獨立而獨特的文化,包括了西班牙-墨西哥的牛仔文化、南北美洲的印第安人原住民文化和後來的數波殖民潮的強烈影響—包括歐洲、非洲和亞洲。 \n 總體上説,美國文化最顯著的影響來自西歐,特別是德意志、英格蘭和愛爾蘭[191],以及後來的意大利、希臘、和中歐猶太人的文化影響。原為奴隸的非裔美國人也保存了一些自西非帶來的文化。美國的地理名稱往往反映了英格蘭、荷蘭、法國、西班牙、和美國原住民等等的綜合歷史成分。 \n 一個描述美國文化的模型是「大熔爐」:移民帶來自己的文化貢獻,溶入美國文化之中,最終形成一個統一的美國文化。最近常用的模型是「色拉碗」:移民帶來的文化會保持一些自己獨立的文化特徵,而非完全融入原有的美國文化,他們所帶來的文化也會成為美國文化的一部分。現代社會學家對美國文化的目標的認同趨向於多元文化論,而非熔爐,很大程度上放棄了熔爐觀念[193]。 \n 20世紀之前的美國文化從模仿歐洲(尤其是英國)逐漸發展到擁有自己的特色,二戰後隨美國經濟軍事政治實力的飛躍,它的文化對全世界、特別是歐洲產生了重大的影響。時至今日,美國流行音樂響徹全球,美國電影和電視則在全球播放。 \n 針對美國文化這種客觀上「入侵」全球的現象,批評聲不絕於耳。很多歐洲人認為美國文化天真幼稚,特別是以法國、俄羅斯等為首的國家對美國文化的進入一直堅決抵制。而東亞、東南亞、南亞和中東地區的文化傳統與美國又大不相同,出現反差不一,深受其影響的有前殖民地菲律賓,以及二戰後的日本、韓國、新加坡等美國盟國,另一方面部分亞洲的伊斯蘭國家則對其有很強的抵觸情緒。同時很多加拿大人和澳洲人也對美國文化的同化影響十分擔憂。美國文化的全球地位極大程度上促進了英語的傳播,使其成為世界上的公認「世界語」,法國則有意在自己能夠影響到的範圍內全力抗擊英語文化的影響,以保存在非洲公用的法語優勢。 \n  音樂[編輯]    路易斯·阿姆斯壯是美國爵士樂的代表人物。\n \n\n 主條目:美國音樂和格林美獎 \n 美國音樂的種類和風格之多,正反映出美國的文化沙律盤的特色。搖滾樂、節奏布魯斯、爵士樂、嘻哈和鄉村音樂等世界聞名的音樂類型都是源自美國。在20世紀初,從美國灌錄、複製的唱片流行音樂逐漸傳播至全世界,一些美國的流行音樂幾乎在世界各地都能聽到[194]。至今,互聯網傳媒時代以及網絡音樂平台的普及更進一步推動了美國流行音樂的全球化發展。 \n 美國音樂的歷史可以追溯至早期美國原住民的傳統宗教音樂,隨着大量歐洲國家移民的到來,替美國音樂增添了基督教合唱、音樂樂譜的色彩。之後的每波移民潮都帶來了不同地區、不同文化和特色的音樂。大量的非裔美國人也帶來了具有非洲特色的傳統音樂,19世紀後期開始浮現的美國流行音樂很大一部分都是源自這些非裔美國人的布魯斯,以及1920年代開始發展的福音音樂。非裔美國人音樂成為了美國流行音樂的根基,混合了歐洲與土著的音樂成分。美國也有大量的民間音樂以及來自烏克蘭、愛爾蘭、蘇格蘭、波蘭、墨西哥和猶太人等移民的音樂。許多美國城市和鄉鎮也都發展出獨立的地區音樂。底特律、紐約、芝加哥、洛杉磯等大城市以及數不盡的小城市都發展出自己的音樂風格。 \n  文學[編輯]    馬克·吐溫,1907年。\n \n\n 主條目:美國文學 \n 如同其他所有國家一般,美國的文學是由其獨特的發展歷史所塑成的。在早期,美國是由東岸的一系列英國殖民地所形成的,因此美國文學的傳統較親近於英國文學。不過,隨着歷史的進展和不斷的移民潮,美國文學的特色和寬廣度都已經超出英國文學的範疇。 \n 在最早的殖民時期,美國文學主要的題材是讚揚新大陸替殖民者和歐洲母國所帶來的利益。宗教信仰上的爭議也是題材之一。隨着革命戰爭的爆發和美國的獨立,本傑明·富蘭克林和托馬斯·潘恩等人寫下的政治著作在文學和政治上都有極大影響,也催生了新國家的獨立意識。寫下了獨立宣言並在後來成為美國總統的托瑪斯·傑弗遜也被認為是美國早期最具天份的作家之一。隨着1812年戰爭和對於獨立文學特色的渴望,更多新的、具有美國特色的作家如愛倫·坡等人逐漸嶄露頭角。奴隸制度的衝突和接踵而來的內戰也對美國文學有深刻影響,到了19世紀末,由於工業化的進展和國土開拓時期的結束,美國文學脫離了原先的邊境文學,馬克·吐溫成為第一個不在東海岸出生的主要作家,開啟美國本土文學之先河。英國作家毛姆認為梅爾維爾的《白鯨記》是世界十大文學名著之一,地位更在馬克吐溫等人之上。 \n 進入了20世紀,工業化帶來的社會轉變使美國文學發展的更為多元和複雜。海明威反映了人們對第一次世界大戰的厭惡情緒。1925年費滋傑羅出版《大亨小傳》代表着20年代經濟大恐慌前美國人的迷夢。黑人文學、南方文學、以及現代文學也在同時期興起。在第二次世界大戰後,新的世代、新的種族、地區、社會特徵都與之前的時代大不相同,大量的移民文學和新興的女性主義文學也成為美國文學的一部分。 \n  影視與戲劇[編輯]  主條目:美國電影、荷里活、奧斯卡金像獎、艾美獎和托尼獎 \n 參見:美國電影列表 \n  在噴射機時代來臨前,數百萬乘船至美國的移民者對美國第一眼的印象,便是紐約港前的自由女神像。\n \n\n  位於洛杉磯的Hollywood標誌\n \n\n 電影誕生發源自美國。英國出生的美國攝影師埃德沃德·邁布里奇拍下了人類史上第一部電影奔跑的馬匹。自從那時開始,美國的電影產業便開始高速發展,加利福尼亞州的荷里活成為電影發展的重鎮,絕大多數電影技術的創新和發展都是源於此處,荷里活電影也成為美國文化的主要代表之一。在1920年代,美國每年平均產出高達800部正規電影,查理·卓別林的喜劇、依據小說《飄》改編的《亂世佳人》和《超人》等許多電影流傳至幾乎每個大陸和國家,成為家喻戶曉的美國象徵。這些電影的出口也使美國獲取了巨大的商業利潤,例如美國大片《鐵達尼號》、《魔戒三部曲:王者再臨》、《加勒比海盜》、《阿凡達》、《變形金剛3》等都在世界各地收穫了超過10億美元以上的票房佳績。 \n 美國也是世界上電視技術發展和普及最早的國家之一。在今天,美國有着數千家電視台,電視是美國人文化和生活的一部分,喜愛看電視也是大多數美國人的少數共同特徵之一。美國民眾透過電視得知國內外的新聞時事,觀看電影、比賽、卡通和肥皂劇。99%的美國家庭至少有一部電視機,絕大多數家庭還擁有兩部。 \n  運動[編輯]   在美國,美式足球是最受歡迎的觀賞運動。[195] \n \n\n 主條目:美國體育 \n 運動是美國全國性的休閒活動,其受歡迎的程度是其他休閒活動都無法相比的。職業運動在美國是商機極大的領域,選擇成為職業運動員的人也獲得極高的報酬。世界上收入最高的運動團隊和運動員絕大多數都是在美國[196]。被稱為「四巨頭」的運動領域包括了棒球、美式足球、冰上曲棍球和籃球。其他受歡迎的運動還包括賽車以及被視為美國最古老的運動、源自於美洲原住民的袋棍球。 \n 美國有着成熟的職業體育聯盟,例如國家橄欖球聯盟(NFL)、美國職棒大聯盟(MLB)、國家籃球協會(NBA)和國家冰球聯盟(NHL)等。 \n 美國也是發展高爾夫球和網球等運動的主要國家。美國同時亦是西方國家裏拳擊和職業摔角的發展中心,比賽往往吸引大量群眾觀戰,同時也吸引各種運動賭博的活動,美國也產出了許多世界知名的拳擊冠軍。其他的格鬥運動,例如源自日本的空手道,在美國也相當受歡迎,並且經常進行比賽。 \n 美國也有許多源自歐洲、並在美國廣泛發展的運動,例如賽馬。英式橄欖球也相當受到歡迎。其他的歐洲運動如馬球和板球雖然並不普及,但也有不少死忠的觀眾。 \n 雖然英式足球是全球範圍最受歡迎的運動,但足球在美國相較其他國家而言普及度並不高,它是國內特別是拉丁美洲,意大利裔以及西班牙裔社區最受歡迎的運動。然而進入2000年代後,越來越多的美國白人青少年選擇足球作為他們的首選運動,根據國務院國情諮詢局在2004年的一份調查,在美國有近1600萬人口經常選擇踢足球,而自1987年至2006年,足球亦是唯一一個參與人數取得淨增長的運動[197],越來越多的城市成立俱樂部加入到影響力日益擴大的MLS(美國職業足球聯盟)中;美國國家足球隊在近幾屆世界盃足球賽中亦取得了不俗的戰績,在2002年韓日世界盃賽中打入八強,2010年南非世界盃賽中亦打進複賽。 \n 大學體育運動在美國也相當普及,受歡迎程度幾乎與職業領域不相上下,尤其是在美式足球和籃球領域。許多大學和學院都培養了運動團隊,定期舉行校際間的競賽。大學和學院所培養的運動類型相當廣泛,從田徑運動到水球都包含在內。同樣的,美國的高中也有各式各樣的體育活動,有時候這些校際間的比賽還會成為當地的頭條新聞,顯示了美國人民對於運動的喜愛和重視。由於金融危機,美國不得不縮減用於體育方面的開支,致使在最近兩次奧運會美國金牌霸主地位受到挑戰。 \n  旅遊景點[編輯]   人文景觀[編輯]   自然風光[編輯]   其他方面[編輯]   美國夢[編輯]   紐約時報廣場的百老匯劇院區。\n \n\n 主條目:美國夢 \n 美國夢(American Dream),是一種相信只要在美國經過努力不懈的奮鬥便能獲致更好生活的理想,亦即人們必須透過自己的工作勤奮、勇氣、創意和決心邁向繁榮,而非依賴於特定的社會階級和他人的援助。通常這代表了人們在經濟上的成功或是企業家的精神[198]。許多歐洲移民都是抱持着美國夢的理想前往美國的。 \n 但少數人批評美國夢過度強調了物質財富在衡量勝利和快樂上扮演的角色。因為與其他大多數國家不同的是,在美國擁有的經濟自由相當多,政府扮演的角色相當有限,這使得美國的社會流動性極大。從美國獨立直至19世紀末期,廣大的土地都無人居住和擁有,任何有心人都可以加以佔據並投資和開墾。而到了工業革命時期,美國龐大的自然資源和先進的工業技術則使得快速的社會流動成為可能。[來源請求]\n  人權狀況[編輯]  主條目:美國人權 \n 參見:美國憲法修正案 \n 美國開國元勛在制訂憲法時就認為限制政府的權力是保證人民的自由的必要措施。權利法案的目的就是保護公民不受聯邦政府侵犯。其中最著名的第一修正案的目標是保護言論自由、出版自由、宗教自由和其他的權利。其他的修正案保護公民受審判團審判的權利、不受無證件的搜查和扣押的權利等等各個方面。 \n \n 西方世界各國普遍把美國看作人權領袖的模範,並認為上面文件所列舉出來的權利是世界上人權中最重要的[來源請求]. \n 美國政府自1940年代以來一直批評數個國家和地區的人權狀況[199]。1970年代以來美國國務院也在其官網每年發佈世界各國的詳細人權報告,因此也遭到被美國批評的國家的反對,如中華人民共和國聲稱人權屬於內政,並在美方公佈數日後也發表美國人權報告作為反擊。俄羅斯則舉行美國人權聽證會,認為美國在人權問題上對盟國和敵對國實行明顯的雙重標準,人權已經成為美國干涉其他國家的政治工具。新加坡外交部在對美國人權報告的回應中認為美國對新加坡使用了雙重標準,並對美國保留關塔那摩監獄等美國人權問題上表示不解。越南則批評美國基於偏見和錯誤的信息,對越南的人權狀況作了不客觀的評價,與越南的實際情況不符。玻利維亞總統莫拉萊斯則認為美國國務院公佈的人權報告是對玻利維亞內部事務的嚴重干涉,並稱美國政府在伊拉克等世界範圍內不奉行尊重人權政策的情況下,來談論拉丁美洲以及玻利維亞的人權問題是沒有道德的。巴西外交部稱巴西不承認美國國務院發表人權報告的合法性,並認為美國才是世界上侵犯人權最嚴重的國家。古巴、尼加拉瓜、朝鮮等國要求對美軍在伊拉克和阿富汗的軍事行動造成大量平民死傷進行調查,並審判相關責任人。印度、孟加拉國、南非、馬來西亞、印度尼西亞等國指出,美國目前僅加入了約三分之一的國際人權保護公約,建議美國儘快批准和執行《經濟、社會、文化權利國際公約》、《消除對婦女一切形式歧視條約》、《兒童權利公約》、《殘疾人權利公約》等核心國際人權條約。 \n 美國對聯合國人權理事會的態度冷淡。美國參議院通過法案決定,美國不會把其聯合國會費中的任何款項交給人權理事會。 \n  反美現象[編輯]  主條目:反美情緒 \n 所謂「反美」簡單來說,就是一種仇視美國的心態,但普遍不存在憑空反美,而存在某種因果關係,就反美而言比較極端的就是基地組織為代表的暴力襲擊美國普通民眾的恐怖行為。 \n 外部產生原因有以下三大因素: \n  美國在世界範圍內憑藉其強大影響力,擴張其國家安全利益及價值觀,被政治與軍事敵對勢力視為「霸權主義」和「帝國主義」,而有美國帝國主義一詞。\n 敵對勢力憑藉美國國會中民主勢力的削弱,以宣稱其民主制度為偽民主\n 美國對外經濟貿易與對佔領地的政策,往往只考慮美國自身的良性發展,並不考慮其政策對外的影響。\n  自身產生原因有以下三大因素: \n  美國在其佔領區內宣揚自身的人權和價值觀,但未充分考慮到當地風俗習慣,某些時候強加於人,易使人反感。\n 美國雖然具有宗教自由和禁止種族歧視,但由美國人大多信奉基督宗教,於歷史、政治以及包括九一一事件在內的恐怖事件等多重因素,美國社會中仍存在對某些宗教和種族的歧視現象,如褻瀆伊斯蘭教聖物《古蘭經》,以及有美國人拍攝詆毀和侮辱伊斯蘭教「先知」穆罕默德的電影《穆斯林的無知》,招致穆斯林反美浪潮。\n   部分意見[編輯]   “  毫無疑問的,蘇聯的垮台使美國成為世界上最強大的國家。大英百科  ”    “  ...(法國)外交部長Hubert Vedrine指出他將美國定義為一個「超級強國」(hyperpower),他以這一新名詞來稱呼他心目中「一個在所有領域都享有支配地位的國家」... ”    “  無論今天的美國是否該被稱為一個帝國,最重要的是美國的確與歷史上的那些帝國相當類似。壓倒性的支配力量使美國經常遭遇敵意。 ”    “  ...(美國)國內生產總值和對外貿易額均居世界首位...經濟發展水平居世界領先地位,國民經濟總值佔世界首位...美國是世界上最大的商品和服務貿易國...美國是世界第一軍事大國...新華網:美國概況  ”    “  ...冷戰的結束使美國成為自羅馬帝國以來都未曾出現過的強權...美國在高等教育、資訊科技、文化—包括音樂、電影、電視、和其他藝術上都是世界上的領導者... ”    參看[編輯]  \n  注釋[編輯]

For the sovereign states of the Americas, see List of sovereign states and dependent territories in the Americas.\n For a broader coverage related to this topic, see U.S. state and Territories of the United States.\n  A map of the United States showing its 50 states and the District of Columbia\n \n\n The United States of America is a federal republic[1] consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United States), five major territories, and various minor islands.[3] The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico; the two other states, Alaska and Hawaii, are in the northwestern part of North America and an archipelago in the mid-Pacific, respectively, while the territories are scattered throughout the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. \n States are the primary subdivisions of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution, such as regulating intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifyingconstitutional amendments. Each state has its own constitution, grounded in republican principles, and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.[4] All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two senators, while representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census.[5] Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the president of the United States, equal to the total of representatives and senators in Congress from that state.[6]Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to the current total of 50, and each new state is admitted on an equal footing with the existing states.[7]\n As provided by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress exercises \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the federal district, which is not part of any state. Prior to passage of the 1973 District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which devolved certain Congressional powers to an elected mayor and council, the district did not have an elected local government. Even so, Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the council and intervene in local affairs.[8] As it is not a state, the district does not have representation in the Senate. However, since 1971, its residents have been represented in the House of Representatives by a non-voting delegate.[9] Additionally, since 1961, following ratification of the 23rd Amendment, the district has been entitled to select three electors to vote in the Electoral College. \n In addition to the 50 states and federal district, the United States has sovereignty over 14 territories. Five of them (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) have a permanent, nonmilitary population, while nine of them do not. With the exception of Navassa Island, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are located in the Caribbean, all territories are located in the Pacific Ocean. One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be unorganized, meaning they have not had an Organic Act enacted by Congress; the four other territories are organized, meaning they have had an Organic Act that has been enacted by Congress. The five inhabited territories each have limited autonomy and a non-voting delegate in Congress, in addition to having territorial legislatures and governors, but residents cannot vote in federal elections. \n California is the most populous state, with 38,332,521 residents (2013 estimate); Wyoming is the least populous, with an estimated 582,658 residents. The District of Columbia, with an estimated 646,449 residents as of 2012, has a higher population than the two least populous states (Wyoming and Vermont). The largest state by area is Alaska, encompassing 665,384 square miles (1,723,340 km2), while the smallest is Rhode Island, encompassing 1,545 square miles (4,000 km2). The first state to ratify the current Constitution was Delaware, which it did on December 7, 1787, while the newest state is Hawaii, which was admitted to the Union on August 21, 1959. The largest territory in terms of both population and size is Puerto Rico, with 3,725,789 residents as of the 2010 Census and a total area of 5,325 square miles (13,790 km2). \n Contents\n\n  States[edit]  The table below lists the 50 states, with their current capital, largest city,[A] the date they ratified the U.S. Constitution or were admitted to the Union, population and area data, and number of representative(s) in the U.S. House of Representatives.[B]\n  States of the United States of America    Name &amp;\npostal abbreviation  Cities  Established[C]  Population\n[D][14]  Total area[15]  Land area[15]  Water area[15]  Number\nof Reps.

Spanish is the second most commonly spoken language.\n Whether the United States or the People's Republic of China is larger is argued against. The figure given is from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's World Factbook. Other sources give smaller figures. All strict calculations of the country's size include only the fifty states and the District of Columbia, not the territories.\n The population estimate includes people whose usual residence is in the fifty states and the District of Columbia, including foreigners. It does not include either those living in the territories, amounting to more than 4 million U.S. citizens (most in Puerto Rico), or U.S. citizens living outside the United States.\n \n  The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federalconstitutional republic containing fifty states and a federal district. The country is located mostly in central North America, where its forty-eight touching states and Washington, D.C., the capital district, lie between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The state of Alaska is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to its east and Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also possesses some territories, or insular areas, in the Caribbean and Pacific. \n At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km2) and with about 306 million people, the United States is the third or fourth-largest country by total area and third-largest by land area and by population. The United States is one of the world's most ethnically mixed and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries.[8] The U.S. economy is the largest national economy in the world, with an estimated 2016 gross domestic product (GDP) of US$20.4 trillion (about a quarter of worldwide GDP).[9]\n The nation was founded by thirteen colonies of Great Britain located along the Atlantic seaboard. On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which announced their independence from Great Britain and their creation of a cooperative union. The disobedient states defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence.[10] The Philadelphia Convention adopted the current United States Constitution on September 17, 1787; its approval the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government. The Bill of Rights, making up ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many basic civil rights and freedoms, was approved in 1791. \n In the 19th century, the United States received land from France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Russia, and took over the Republic of Texas and the Republic of Hawaii. Arguments between the farming-based South and industrial North over states' rights and the growth of the institution of slavery began the American Civil War of the 1860s. The North's victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the end of legal slavery in the United States. By the 1870s, the national wealth was the world's largest.[11] The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a military power. In 1945, the United States came out from World War II as the first country with nuclear weapons, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and a founding member of NATO. The end of the Cold War and the breaking up of the Soviet Union left the United States as the only superpower. The country accounts for about half of worldwide military spending and is a leading economic, political, and cultural force in the world.\n Contents\n\n  Geography[change | change source]  Main article: Geography of the United States \n   Satellite imagery of the contiguous United States.\n \n\n The land area of the contiguous United States is 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,941 km2). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856 km2). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area.[13] The United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China. The ranking differs depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured. The Encyclopædia Britannica, for instance, lists the size of the United States as 3,677,649 square miles (9,525,067 km2), as they do not count the country's coastal or territorial waters.[14]The World Factbook, which includes those waters, gives 3,796,742 square miles (9,833,517 km2).[15]\n The U.S's geography varies a lot and includes: \n The climate varies along with the geography, from tropical (hot and wet in summer, warm and dry in winter) in Florida to tundra (cold all year) in Alaska. Large parts of the country have warm summers and cold winters. Some parts of the United States, like parts of California, have a Mediterranean climate. \n  History[change | change source]  Main article: History of the United States \n  Native Americans and European settlers[change | change source]  Main articles: Native Americans in the United States, European colonization of the Americas, and Thirteen Colonies \n  An ancient palace built by the Anasazi people in Mesa Verde National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Colorado.\n \n\n It is believed that the indigenous peoples of the continental United States, including the natives of Alaska, moved in from Asia. They began arriving twelve or forty thousand years ago, if not earlier.[16] Some, such as the pre-ColumbianMississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced farming, grand construction, and state-level communities. The native population of America decreased after Europeans arrived, and for different reasons, mostly sicknesses such as smallpox and measles.[17]\n In 1492, Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus, under contract to the Spanish crown, reached some Caribbean islands, making the first contact with the native people. On April 2, 1513, Spanish conquistadorJuan Ponce de León landed on what he called \"La Florida\"—the first recorded European coming on what would become the U.S. mainland. Spanish settlements in the area were followed by ones in the present-day southwestern United States that drew thousands through Mexico. French fur traders established outposts of New France around the Great Lakes; France eventually claimed much of the North American interior, down to the Gulf of Mexico. The first successful English settlements were the Colony of Virginia in Jamestown in 1607 and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. The 1628 chartering of the Massachusetts Bay Colony resulted in a wave of relocation; by 1634, New England had been settled by some 10,000 Puritans. Between the late 1610s and the American Revolution, about 50,000 convicts were shipped to Britain's American colonies.[18] Beginning in 1614, the Dutch settled along the lower Hudson River, including New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. \n  Independence and expansion[change | change source]  Main articles: American Revolution, American Revolutionary War, and Manifest destiny \n   Declaration of Independence, by John Trumbull, 1817–18\n \n\n Tensions between American colonials and the British during the rebel period of the 1760s and early 1770s led to the American Revolutionary War, fought from 1775 through 1781. On June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, established a Continental Army under the command of George Washington. Announcing that \"all men are created equal\" and are born with \"certain natural rights,\" the Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, drafted mostly by Thomas Jefferson, on July 4, 1776. That date is now celebrated every year as America's Independence Day. In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak federal government that operated until 1789. \n After the British defeat by American forces helped by the French, Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States and the states' sovereignty over American land west to the Mississippi River. A constitutional convention was organized in 1787 by those wishing to establish a strong national government, with powers of taxation. The United States Constitution was approved in 1788, and the new republic's first Senate, House of Representatives, and President—George Washington—took office in 1789. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and certifying a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791. \n Attitudes toward slavery were shifting; a clause in the Constitution protected the African slave trade only until 1808. The Northern states permanently stopped slavery between 1780 and 1804, leaving the slave states of the South as defenders of the \"peculiar institution.\" The Second Great Awakening, beginning about 1800, made evangelicalism a force behind different social reform movements, including abolitionism. \n  Land-based purchases by date.\n \n\n Americans' eagerness to expand westward caused a long series of Indian Wars and an Indian removal policy that stripped the native peoples of their land. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed land under President Thomas Jefferson in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size. The War of 1812, declared against Britain over different complaints and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. A series of U.S. military invasions into Florida led Spain to give up it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. The United States took over the Republic of Texas in 1845. The idea of Manifest destiny became popular during this time.[19] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. The U.S. victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest. The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 further encouraged western relocation. New railways made relocation easier for settlers and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, up to 40 million American bison, or buffalo, were murdered for skins and meat and to ease the railways' spread. The loss of the buffalo, which were valuable to the plains Indians, caused many native cultures to become gone forever. \n  Civil War and industrialization[change | change source]  See also: American Civil War, Reconstruction era, and Spanish–American War \n   Battle of Gettysburg, lithograph by Currier and Ives, ca. 1863\n \n\n Tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over the relationship between the state and federal governments, as well as violent conflicts over the spread of slavery into new states. Abraham Lincoln, a candidate of the mostly antislavery Republican Party, was elected president in 1860. Before he took office, seven slave states declared their secession—which the federal government maintained was illegal—and formed the Confederate States of America. With the Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter, the American Civil War began and four more slave states joined the Confederacy. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation committed the Union to end slavery. Following the Union victory in 1865, three changes to the U.S. Constitution secured freedom for the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,made them citizens, and gave them voting rights. The war and its resolution led to a big increase in federal power.\n  Immigrants landing on Ellis Island, New York, 1902.\n \n\n After the war, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln caused the Reconstruction, where policies were put together directed at getting back and rebuilding the Southern states while securing the rights of the newly freed slaves. The resolution of the disputed 1876 presidential election by the Compromise of 1877 ended this era, and the Jim Crow laws soon disenfranchised many African Americans. In the North, urbanization and a never-before-seen inflow of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe made the country's industrialization grow rapidly. The wave of immigration, lasting until 1929, gave labor and changed American culture. High tax protections, national infrastructure building, and new banking laws encouraged growth also. The 1867 Alaska Purchase from Russia completed the country's mainland expansion. The Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890 was the last major armed conflict of the Indian Wars. In 1893, the native monarchy of the Pacific Kingdom of Hawaii was ended in a secret and successful plan led by American residents; the United States took over the archipelago in 1898. Victory in the Spanish–American War the same year proved that the United States was a world power and led to the addition of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. The Philippines gained independence fifty years later; Puerto Rico and Guam are still U.S. territories. \n  World War I, Great Depression, and World War II[change | change source]   An abandoned farm in South Dakota during the Dust Bowl, in 1936.\n \n\n As the First World War erupted in Europe in 1914, the United States declared itself neutral. Afterward, the Americans sympathized with the British and French, even though many citizens, especially those from Ireland and Germany, were against the intervention. In 1917, they joined the Allies, adding to the defeat of the Central Powers. Unwilling to participate in European affairs, the Senate did not approve the Treaty of Versailles (1919), which established the League of Nations, applying a policy of unilateralism, which bordered on isolationism. In 1920, the Women's rights movement gained the approval of a constitutional amendment to grant women the right to vote.\n  Soldiers of United States Army about to disembark on June 6, 1944 on Omaha Beach (France) during Battle of Normandy of Second World War.\n \n\n The United States, officially neutral during the early stages of World War II, began supplying supplies to the Allies in March 1941, through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the country joined the Allies fight against the Axis Powers, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. World War II boosted the economy by providing investment capital and jobs, making many women enter the labor market. Of the significant fighters, the United States was the only nation to be enriched by war. The discussions at Bretton Woods and Yalta created a new system of international organization that placed the country and the Soviet Union at the heart of world affairs. In 1945, when the end of the Second World War in Europe came, an international gathering held in San Francisco drafted the Charter of the United Nations, which came into force after the war. Having developed the first nuclear weapon, the government decided to use it in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of that same year. Japan gave up on September 2, ending the war.[30]\n  Cold War and civil rights era[change | change source]  See also: Cold War, McCarthyism, Civil rights movement, Vietnam War, and Watergate scandal \n   Martin Luther King, Jr. delivering his world-renowned \"I Have a Dream\" speech in 1963.\n \n\n  The \"Baker\" explosion, part of Operation Crossroads, at Bikini Atoll, Micronesia, in 1946.\n \n\n In the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed after the Second World War, controlling the military affairs of Europe through NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The first supported liberal democracy and capitalism, while the second favored communism and an economy planned by the government. Both supported several dictatorships and participated in proxy wars. Between 1950 and 1953, U.S. troops fought Chinese communist forces in the Korean War.[31] From the break with the USSR and the start of the Cold War until 1957, McCarthyism also called the Second Red Dread, developed within the United States. The State unleashed a wave of political mistreatment and a campaign of prejudice against Communists, which some authors point out as of a totalitarian state. Hundreds of people were arrested, including celebrities, and between 10,000 and 12,000 people lost their jobs. The abuse ended when the courts declared it unconstitutional.[33]\n   Richard Nixon leaving the White House after resigning as a result of the Watergate scandal, August 9, 1974.\n \n\n In 1961, the Soviet launch of the first human-crewed spacecraft caused President John F. Kennedy to propose to the country to be the first to send \"a man to the Moon\", a fact completed in 1969.[34] Kennedy also faced a tense nuclear conflict with the Soviet forces in Cuba, while the economy grew and expanded steadily. A growing movement for civil rights, represented and led by African-Americans such as Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr. and James Bevel, used nonviolence to deal with segregation and discrimination.[35] After Kennedy's murder in 1963, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were passed during the term of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson and his successor, Richard Nixon, led a civil war in Southeast Asia, assistant to the unsuccessful Vietnam War. A generalized counterculture movement grew, driven by opposition to war, black nationalism and the sexual revolution. A new wave of feminist movements also emerged, led by Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem and other women who sought political, social and economic equity. \n In 1974, as a result of the Watergate scandal, Nixon became the first president to resign, to avoid being dismissed on charges such as obstruction of justice and abuse of power, and was succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford.[36] The presidency of Jimmy Carter in the 1970s was marked by stagflation and the hostage crisis in Iran. The election of Ronald Reagan as president in 1980 announced a change in U.S. policy, which was reflected in significant changes in taxes and fiscal expenses. His second term brought with it the Iran–Contra affair and the significant diplomatic progress with the Soviet Union. The later Soviet collapse ended the Cold War. \n  Modern history[change | change source]  See also: September 11 attacks, War in Afghanistan (2001–present), Iraq War, Great Recession, and International military intervention against ISIL \n  A large cloud of dust surrounds the city of New York after the collapse of the Twin Towers after the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.\n \n\n Under President George H. W. Bush, the country took on a global dominant role worldwide, as in the Gulf War (1991). The longest economic expansion in modern American history, from March 1991 to March 2001, spanned the presidency of Bill Clinton and the dot-com bubble.[37] A civil lawsuit and a sex scandal led to his impeachment in 1998, although he managed to finish his period. The 2000 presidential elections, one of the most competitive in American history, they were settled by the Supreme Court: George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, became president, even though he gained fewer votes than his opponent Al Gore.[38]\n On September 11, 2001, the terrorists of the Al-Qaeda group attacked the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City (which were destroyed) and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., in a series of attacks that ended the life of nearly three thousand people. In response, the Bush administration launched the \"War on Terror.\" At the end of 2001, U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan, toppled the Taliban government and destroyed Al-Qaeda's training camps. Taliban insurgents continue to fight a guerrilla war. In 2002, Bush began to push for a regime change to take place in Iraq.[39][40] With NATO's lack of support and without a clear UN order for military intervention, Bush organized the coalition of the willing; The coalition forces quickly invaded Iraq in 2003 and toppled the statue of dictator Saddam Hussein. The following year, Bush was re-elected as the most voted president in an election. \n In 2005, Hurricane Katrina, which would end up being the deadliest natural disaster in national history, caused severe destruction along the Gulf Coast: the city of New Orleans was devastated, with 1833 dead.[41]\n  President Donald Trump with his predecessor Barack Obama, the first African American president.\n \n\n On November 4, 2008, during a global economic downturn, Barack Obama was elected president, having been the first African American to take office. In May 2011, American Special forces managed to kill Osama bin Laden, hiding in Pakistan. The following year, Barack Obama was re-elected. Under his second term, he led the war against the Islamic State and restored diplomatic relations with Cuba. \n On November 8, 2016, the Republican Party leader Donald Trump defeated former First Lady Hillary Clinton for presidency in an unusual election and whose plans have been described by political analysts as populist, protectionist and nationalist, assuming office on January 20, 2017.\n The massacres in Orlando of June 12, 2016 at the gay disco Pulse (51 dead) and in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017 (60) are listed as the largest massacres in the country since 9/11.[43]\n  Government[change | change source]  Main article: Federal government of the United States \n The United States is a federalrepublic. The federal government of the United States is set up by the Constitution. There are three branches. They are the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. State governments and the federal government work in very similar ways. Each state has its own executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The executive branch of a state government is led by a governor, instead of a president. \n  Executive branch[change | change source]  The executive branch is the part of the government that enforces the law. Members of the U.S. Electoral College elect a president who is the leader of the executive branch, as well as the leader of the armed forces. The president may veto a bill that the Congress has passed, so it does not become a law. The President may also make \"executive orders\" to ensure that people follow the law. \n The president is in charge of many departments that control much of the day-to-day actions of government. For example, Department of Commerce makes rules about trade. The president chooses the heads of these departments, and also nominates federal judges. However, the Senate, part of the legislative branch, must agree with all of the people the president chooses. The president may serve two 4-year terms. \n  Legislative branch[change | change source]   The west side of the United States Capitol, which is home to the United States Congress \n \n\n The legislative branch makes laws. The legislative branch is called the United States Congress. Congress is divided into two \"houses\". \n One house is the House of Representatives. The Representatives are each elected by voters from a set area within a state. The number of Representatives a state has is based on how many people live there. Representatives serve two-year terms. The total number of representatives today is 435. The leader of the House of Representatives is the Speaker of the House. \n The other house is the Senate. In the Senate, each state is represented equally, by two senators. Because there are 50 states, there are 100 senators. The President's treaties or appointments of officials need the Senate's approval. Senators serve six-year terms. The Vice President of the United States serves as president of the Senate. In practice, the vice president is usually absent from the Senate, and a senator serves as president pro tempore, or temporary president, of the Senate. \n Representatives and senators propose laws, called \"bills\", in their respective houses. A bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group, known as a committee, which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house. If one house votes to pass a bill, the bill then gets sent to the other house; if both houses vote for it, it is then sent to the president, who may sign the bill into law or veto it. If the president vetoes the bill, it is sent back to Congress. If Congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two-thirds majority, the bill becomes law and cannot be vetoed by the president. \n Under the American system of federalism, Congress may not make laws that directly control the states; instead, Congress may use the promise of federal funds, or special circumstances such as national emergencies, to encourage the states to follow federal law. This system is both complex and unique. \n  Judicial branch[change | change source]  The judicial branch is the part of government that interprets what the law means. The Judicial Branch is made up of the Supreme Court and many lower courts. If the Supreme Court decides that a law is not allowed by the Constitution, the law is said to be \"struck down\" and is no longer a valid law. \n The Supreme Court is made up of nine judges, called justices, who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. One of these justices, called the chief justice, heads the court. A Supreme Court justice serves until he or she dies or resigns (quits in the middle of his or her term). When that happens, the president nominates someone new to replace the justice who left. If the Senate agrees with that choice, the person becomes a justice. If the Senate does not agree with the president's choice, then the president must nominate someone else. \n Famous court cases such as Marbury v Madison (which was decided in 1803) have firmly established that the Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the United States Constitution and has the power to strike down any law that conflicts with it.[44]\n  Politics[change | change source]  See also: States of the United States and Politics of the United States \n  The political system of the United States\n \n\n The United States of America consists of 50 states, 5 territories and 1 district (Washington D.C.). States can make laws about things inside the state, but federal law is about things dealing with more than one state or dealing with other countries. In some areas, if the federal government makes laws that say different things from the state laws, people must follow the federal law because the state law is not a law any more. Each state has a constitution of its own, different from the federal (national) Constitution. Each of these is like the federal Constitution because they say how each state's government is set up, but some also talk about specific laws. \n The federal and most state governments are dominated by two political parties: the Republicans and the Democrats. There are many smaller parties; the largest of these are the Libertarian Party and the Green Party. People help in political campaigns that they like. They try to persuade politicians to help them; this is called lobbying. All Americans are allowed to do these things, but some have and spend more money than others, or in other ways do more in politics. Some people think this is a problem, and lobby for rules to be made to change it. \n Since 2017, the president is a Republican, and Congress is also Republican-controlled, so the Republicans have more power in the federal government. There are still many powerful Democrats who can try to stop the Republicans from doing things that they believe will be bad for the country. Also, members of a party in power do not always agree on what to do. If enough people decide to vote against Republicans in the next election, they will lose power. In a republic like the United States, no party can do whatever they want. All politicians have to argue, compromise, and make deals with each other to get things done. They have to answer to the people and take responsibility for their mistakes. \n The USA's large cultural, economic, and military influence has made the foreign policy of the United States, or relations with other countries, a topic in American politics, and the politics of many other countries. \n  Political divisions[change | change source]  Main articles: U.S. state, Territorial evolution of the United States, and Territorial changes of the United States \n  States[change | change source]  See also: List of U.S. states \n The United States conquered and bought new lands over time, and grew from the original 13 colonies in the east to the current 50 states, of which 48 of them are joined together to make up the contiguous United States. These states, called the \"lower 48\", can all be reached by road without crossing a border into another country. They go from the Atlantic east to the Pacific in the west. There are two other states which are not joined to the lower 48 states. Alaska can be reached by passing through British Columbia and the Yukon, both of which are part of Canada. Hawaii is located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and is so far from the rest of the US that it can only be reached by airplane. \n Washington, D.C., the national capital, is a federal district that was split from the states of Maryland and Virginia in 1791. Not part of any US state, it used to be in the shape of a square, with the land west of the Potomac River coming from Virginia, and the land east of the river coming from Maryland. In 1846, Virginia took back its part of the land. Some people living in DC want it to become a state, or for Maryland to take back its land, so that they can have the right to vote in Congress. \n  Territories and possessions[change | change source]  The United States consists of sixteen lands that are not states, many of which are colonialterritories. None of them have any land borders with the rest of the US. People live in five of these places, which are de facto American: \n The Philippines was a possession of the United States. Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and other Pacific island nations were governed by the United States as a United Nations \"Trust Territory\". All of these places have become independent: the Philippines in 1946, Palau in 1947, and Micronesia in 1986. \n The U.S. armed forces has bases in many countries, and the U.S. Navy's base at Guantanamo Bay was rented from Cuba after that country had a Communist revolution. \n  Counties and cities[change | change source]  See also: List of United States cities by population \n All the states are divided into administrative subdivisions. Most of them are called counties, but Louisiana uses the word \"parish,\" and Alaska uses the word \"borough.\" \n There are many cities in the United States. One city in each state is the state capital, where the government of the state meets and the governor works. This city is not always the largest in its state. For example, the city with the most people living in it is New York City in New York State, but the state capital is Albany. Some other big cities are Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; Miami, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Las Vegas, Nevada; Houston and Dallas, Texas; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Boston, Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado; St. Louis, Missouri and Detroit, Michigan. \n  Economy[change | change source]  The United States has a capitalisteconomy. The country has rich mineralresources, with many gold, coal and uranium deposits. Farming makes the country among the top producers of, among others, corn (maize), wheat, sugar, and tobacco. Housing contributes about 15% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States[45]America produces cars, airplanes, and electronics. About 3/4 of Americans work in the service industry. \n The top 15 trading partners in terms of total trade are: \n  Country  Canada China Mexico Japan Germany UK South Korea France Taiwan Netherlands Brazil Malaysia Italy Singapore Ireland   Demographics[change | change source]   Historical population   Census Pop. %±   1790 3,929,000  —   1800 5,308,000  35.1%   1810 7,240,000  36.4%    9,638,000  33.1%   1830 12,866,000  33.5%   1840 17,063,000  32.6%   1850 23,192,000  35.9%   1860 31,443,321  35.6%   1870 38,558,371  22.6%   1880 50,189,209  30.2%   1890 62,979,766  25.5%   1900 76,212,168  21.0%   1910 92,228,531  21.0%    106,021,568  15.0%   1930 123,202,660  16.2%   1940 132,164,569  7.3%   1950 151,325,798  14.5%   1960 179,323,175  18.5%   1970 203,211,926  13.3%   1980 226,545,805  11.5%   1990 248,709,873  9.8%    281,421,906  13.2%    308,745,538  9.7%   The United States of America has people of many different race and ethnic backgrounds. 80% of the people in the United States descend from Europeanimmigrants. Many people are descended from Germany, England, Scotland, Ireland, Africa, and Italy.[46] 13% of the people in the United States are African-American. Most of them descend from the African slaves that were brought to America. Asian-Americans make up only 5% of the population in America but make up a bigger portion in the west coast. For example, in California, Asian-Americans make up 13% of the population of that state. Hispanic-Americans or people of Latin origins make up 15% of the nation. The original peoples, called Native American, American Indians, or Amerindians and Inuit (Eskimos) are a very small group. \n 11% of the people in the United States are foreign born. 18% speak a language other than English at home. For people 25 and older, 80% are high schoolgraduates while 25% have a bachelor's degree or higher. \n The 2000 Census counted self-reported ancestry. It identified 43 million German-Americans, 30.5 million Irish-Americans, 24.9 million African-Americans, 24.5 million English-Americans, and 18.4 million Mexican-Americans. \n  Money[change | change source]  The socialstructure of the United States has a big range. This means that some Americans are much, much richer than others. The average (median) income for an American was $37,000 a year in 2002. However, the richest 1% of Americans have as much money as the poorest 90%. 51% of all households have access to a computer and 41% had access to the Internet in 2000, a figure which had grown to 75% in 2004. Also, 67.9% of American families owned their homes in 2002. There are 200 million cars in the United States, two for every three Americans. The debt has grown to over $21,000,000,000,000. \n  Religion[change | change source]  There are many different religions in the U.S. Statistically, the largest religion is Christianity, including groups such as Catholicism, Protestantism and Mormonism. Other religions include Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Unitarian Universalism, Wicca, Druidry, Baha'i, Raelism, Zoroastrianism, Taoism and Jainism.[47] Religions which were founded within the United States include Eckankar, Satanism and Scientology. Native American religions have various animistic beliefs. \n The United States is one of the most religious countries in the Western World, and most Americans believe in God. The number of Christians in the U.S. has gone down. 86.2% called themselves Christian in 1990 and 78.4% said this in 2007. The others include Judaism (2.3%), Islam (0.8%), Buddhism (0.7%), Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%). Those who have no religion are at 16.1%. There is a large difference between those who say that they belong to a religion and those who are members of a religious body of that religion.[48]\n Doubts about the existence of a God, gods or goddesses are higher among young people.[49] Among the non-religious population of the U.S., there are deists, humanists, ignotic, atheists, and agnostics.[50]\n  Languages[change | change source]   Languages (2007)   English 225.5 million    Spanish, incl.

Spanish has increased in usage in certain sectors of society, due to a flow of immigrants—especially from Mexico and Cuba. French is also a main language in parts of Louisiana because France once owned the area as a colony. \n  Culture[change | change source]  American popular culture goes out to many places in the world. It has a large influence on most of the world, especially the Western world. American music is heard all over the world, and American movies and television shows can be seen in most countries. \n  Federal holidays[change | change source]    Date  Name  Description    January 1 New Year's Day Celebrates the beginning of the year    3rd Monday in January   Martin Luther King, Jr. Day  Honors Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., an African-Americancivil rights leader    3rd Monday in February  President's Day Honors all of the American presidents, but specifically George Washington (b.

Bound together in a political union, each state holds governmental jurisdiction over a separate and defined geographic territory and shares its sovereignty with the federal government. Due to this shared sovereignty, Americans are citizens both of the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.[3] State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). \n States are divided into counties or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state, and states may also create other local governments. State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions. All are grounded in republican principles, and each provides for a government, consisting of three branches, each with separate and independent powers: executive, legislative, and judicial.[4]\n States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution. States and their residents are represented in the United States Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors (equal to the total number of representatives and senators from that state) to vote in the Electoral College, the body that directly elects the President of the United States. Additionally, each state has the opportunity to ratifyconstitutional amendments, and, with the consent of Congress, two or more states may enter into interstate compacts with one another. \n Historically, the tasks of local law enforcement, public education, public health, regulating intrastate commerce, and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well. Over time, the Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over states' rights, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals. \n The Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted, both in 1959. The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede (withdraw) from the Union. Shortly after the Civil War, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Texas v. White, held that a state cannot unilaterally do so.[5][6]\n Contents\n\n States of the United States Further information on each U.S. state: List of states and territories of the United States \n See also: List of U.S. state abbreviations \n The 50 U.S. states, in alphabetical order, along with each state's flag: \n \n\n \n\n Governments Main article: State governments of the United States \n Further information: Comparison of U.S. state governments \n  Administrative divisions\nof the United States  First level      Second level       Third level      Fourth level   Other areas        \n  As sovereign entities, each of the 50 states reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way (within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution) deemed appropriate by its people. As a result, while the governments of the various states share many similar features, they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance. No two state governments are identical. \n Constitutions Further information: State constitution (United States) \n The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution. Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart. The Constitution of Alabama, for example, contains 310,296 words – more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution.[7] In practice, each state has adopted the three-branch frame of the federal government: executive, legislative, and judicial (even though doing so has never been required).[7][8]\n Executive Further information: Governor (United States) \n In each state, the chief executive is called the governor, who serves as both head of state and head of government. All governors are chosen by direct election. The governor may approve or veto bills passed by the state legislature, as well as recommend and work for the passage of bills, usually supported by their political party. In 44 states, governors have line item veto power.[9] Most states have a plural executive, meaning that the governor is not the only government official in the state responsible for its executive branch. In these states, executive power is distributed amongst other officials,[10] elected by the people independently of the governor—such as the lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller, secretary of state, and others. \n The constitutions of 19 states allow for citizens to remove and replace an elected public official before the end of their term of office through a recall election.[11] Each state follows its own procedures for recall elections, and sets its own restrictions on how often, and how soon after a general election, they may be held. In all states, the legislatures can remove state executive branch officials, including governors, who have committed serious abuses of their power from office. The process of doing so includes impeachment (the bringing of specific charges), and a trial, in which legislators act as a jury.[11]\n Legislative Further information: State legislature (United States) \n The primary responsibilities of state legislatures are to enact state laws and appropriate money for the administration of public policy.[9] In all states, if the governor vetoes a bill (or a portion of one), it can still become law if the legislature overrides the veto (repasses the bill) by a two-thirds vote in each chamber.[9] In 49 of the 50 states the legislature consists of two chambers: a lower house (termed the House of Representatives, State Assembly, General Assembly or House of Delegates) and a smaller upper house, always termed the Senate. The exception is the unicameralNebraska Legislature, which has only a single chamber. Most states have a part-time legislature (traditionally called a citizen legislature). Ten state legislatures are considered full-time; these bodies are more similar to the U.S. Congress than are the others.[13]\n Members of each state's legislature are chosen by direct election. In Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court held that all states are required to elect their legislatures in such a way as to afford each citizen the same degree of representation (the one person, one vote standard). In practice, most states elect legislators from single-member districts, each of which has approximately the same population. Some states, such as Maryland and Vermont, divide the state into single- and multi-member districts, in which case multi-member districts must have proportionately larger populations, e.g., a district electing two representatives must have approximately twice the population of a district electing just one. The voting systems used across the nation are: first-past-the-post in single-member districts, and multiple non-transferable vote in multi-member districts. \n In 2013, there were a total of 7,383 legislators in the 50 state legislative bodies. They earned from $0 annually (New Mexico) to $90,526 (California). There were various per diem and mileage compensation.[14]\n Judicial Further information: State court (United States) \n States can also organize their judicial systems differently from the federal judiciary, as long as they protect the federal constitutional right of their citizens to procedural due process. Most have a trial level court, generally called a District Court, Superior Court or Circuit Court, a first-level appellate court, generally called a Court of Appeal (or Appeals), and a Supreme Court. However, Oklahoma and Texas have separate highest courts for criminal appeals. In New York State the trial court is called the Supreme Court; appeals are then taken to the Supreme Court's Appellate Division, and from there to the Court of Appeals. \n State court systems provide general courts with broad jurisdiction. The overwhelming majority of criminal and civil cases in the United States are heard in state courts. The annual number of cases filed in state courts are around 30,000,000 and the number of judges in state courts is about 30,000—by comparison, federal courts see some 1,000,000 filed cases with about 1700 judges.[15]\n Most states base their legal system on English common law (with substantial indigenous changes and incorporation of certain civil law innovations), with the notable exception of Louisiana, a former French colony, which draws large parts of its legal system from French civil law. \n Only a few states choose to have the judges on the state's courts serve for life terms. In most of the states the judges, including the justices of the highest court in the state, are either elected or appointed for terms of a limited number of years, and are usually eligible for re-election or reappointment. \n States as unitary systems All states have unitary governments, local governments are created under state law, and ultimately, local governments within each state are subject to the central authority of that particular state. State governments commonly delegate some authority to local units and channel policy decisions down to them for implementation.[16] In a few states, local units of government are permitted a degree of home rule over various matters. The prevailing legal theory of state preeminence over local governments, referred to as Dillon's Rule, holds that, \n A municipal corporation possesses and can exercise the following powers and no others: First, those granted in express words; second, those necessarily implied or necessarily incident to the powers expressly granted; third, those absolutely essential to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation-not simply convenient but indispensable; fourth, any fair doubt as to the existence of a power is resolved by the courts against the corporation-against the existence of the powers.[17]\n Each state defines for itself what powers it will allow local governments. Generally, four categories of power may be given to local jurisdictions: \n  Relationships Among states Each state admitted to the Union by Congress since 1789 has entered it on an equal footing with the original States in all respects.[19] With the growth of states' rights advocacy during the antebellum period, the Supreme Court asserted, in Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan (1845), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality. With the consent of Congress, states may enter into interstate compacts, agreements between two or more states. Compacts are frequently used to manage a shared resource, such as transportation infrastructure or water rights.\n Under Article IV of the Constitution, which outlines the relationship between the states, each state is required to give full faith and credit to the acts of each other's legislatures and courts, which is generally held to include the recognition of most contracts and criminal judgments, and before 1865, slavery status. Under the Extradition Clause, a state must extradite people located there who have fled charges of \"treason, felony, or other crimes\" in another state if the other state so demands. The principle of hot pursuit of a presumed felon and arrest by the law officers of one state in another state are often permitted by a state.\n The full faith and credit expectation does have exceptions, some legal arrangements, such as professional licensure and marriages, may be state-specific, and until recently states have not been found by the courts to be required to honor such arrangements from other states. Such legal acts are nevertheless often recognized state-to-state according to the common practice of comity. States are prohibited from discriminating against citizens of other states with respect to their basic rights, under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. \n With the federal government Further information: Federalism in the United States \n Under Article IV, each state is guaranteed a form of government that is grounded in republican principles, such as the consent of the governed. This guarantee has long been at the fore-front of the debate about the rights of citizens vis-à-vis the government. States are also guaranteed protection from invasion, and, upon the application of the state legislature (or executive, if the legislature cannot be convened), from domestic violence. This provision was discussed during the 1967 Detroit riot, but was not invoked. \n The Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2) establishes that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties made under its authority, constitute the supreme law of the land. It provides that state courts are bound by the supreme law; in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law must be applied. Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal law.\n States' rights are understood mainly with reference to the Tenth Amendment. The Constitution delegates some powers to the national government, and it forbids some powers to the states. The Tenth Amendment reserves all other powers to the states, or to the people. Powers of the U.S Congress are enumerated in Article I, Section 8, for example, the power to declare war. Making treaties is one power forbidden to the states, being listed among other such powers in Article I, Section 10. \n Among the Article I enumerated powers of Congress is the power to regulate Commerce. Since the early 20th century, the Supreme Court's interpretation of this \"Commerce Clause\" has, over time, greatly expanded scope of federal power, at the expense of powers formerly considered purely states' matters. The Cambridge Economic History of the United States says, \"On the whole, especially after the mid-1880s, the Court construed the Commerce Clause in favor of increased federal power.\" In 1941, the Supreme Court in U.S. v. Darby upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, holding that Congress had the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate employment conditions. Then, one year later, in Wickard v. Filburn, the Court expanded federal power to regulate the economy by holding that federal authority under the commerce clause extends to activities which may appear to be local in nature but in reality effect the entire national economy and are therefore of national concern. For example, Congress can regulate railway traffic across state lines, but it may also regulate rail traffic solely within a state, based on the reality that intrastate traffic still affects interstate commerce. Through such decisions, argues law professor David F. Forte, \"the Court turned the commerce power into the equivalent of a general regulatory power and undid the Framers' original structure of limited and delegated powers.\" Subsequently, Congress invoked the Commerce Clause to expand federal criminal legislation, as well as for social reforms such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Only within the past couple of decades, through decisions in cases such as those in U.S. v. Lopez (1995) and U.S. v. Morrison (2000), has the Court tried to limit the Commerce Clause power of Congress.[30]\n As prescribed by Article I of the Constitution, which establishes the U.S. Congress, each state is represented in the Senate (irrespective of population size) by two senators, and each is guaranteed at least one representative in the House. Both senators and representatives are chosen in direct popular elections in the various states. (Prior to 1913, senators were elected by state legislatures.) There are presently 100 senators, who are elected at-large to staggered terms of six years, with one-third of them being chosen every two years. Representatives are elected at-large or from single-member districts to terms of two years (not staggered). The size of the House—presently 435 voting members—is set by federal statute. Seats in the House are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. The borders of these districts are established by the states individually through a process called redistricting, and within each state all districts are required to have approximately equal populations.[33]\n While the Constitution does set parameters for the election of federal officials, state law, not federal, regulates most aspects of elections in the U.S., including: primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state's electoral college, as well as the running of state and local elections. All elections—federal, state and local—are administered by the individual states, and some voting rules and procedures may differ among them.[37]\n Article V of the Constitution accords states a key role in the process of amending the U.S. Constitution. Amendments may be proposed either by Congress with a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate, or by a convention of states called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures.[38] To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must be ratified by either—as determined by Congress—the legislatures of three-quarters of the states or state ratifying conventions in three-quarters of the states.[39] The vote in each state (to either ratify or reject a proposed amendment) carries equal weight, regardless of a state's population or length of time in the Union. \n Admission into the Union Main article: Admission to the Union \n  U.S. states by date of statehood:\n 1776–1790 1791–1796\n 1803–1819 1820–1837\n 1845–1859 1861–1876\n 1889–1896 1907–1912\n 1959\n \n\n  The order in which the original 13 states ratified the Constitution, then the order in which the others were admitted to the Union\n \n\n Article IV also grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states. It also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress. This caveat was designed to give Eastern states that still had Western land claims (including Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia), to have a veto over whether their western counties could become states,[19] and has served this same function since, whenever a proposal to partition an existing state or states in order that a region within might either join another state or to create a new state has come before Congress. \n When the people of a territory make their desire for statehood known to the federal government, Congress may pass an enabling act authorizing the people of that territory to organize a constitutional convention to write a state constitution as a step towards admission to the Union. Each act details the mechanism by which the territory will be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers. Although the use of an enabling act is a traditional historic practice, a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted. Upon acceptance of that constitution, and upon meeting any additional Congressional stipulations, Congress has always admitted that territory as a state. \n In addition to the original 13, six subsequent states were never an organized territory of the federal government, or part of one, before being admitted to the Union. Three were set off from an already existing state, two entered the Union after having been sovereign states, and one was established from unorganized territory: \n Congress is under no obligation to admit states, even in those areas whose population expresses a desire for statehood. Such has been the case numerous times during the nation's history. In one instance, Mormon pioneers in Salt Lake City sought to establish the state of Deseret in 1849. It existed for slightly over two years and was never approved by the United States Congress. In another, leaders of the Five Civilized Tribes (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole) in Indian Territory proposed to establish the state of Sequoyah in 1905, as a means to retain control of their lands.[48] The proposed constitution ultimately failed in the U.S. Congress. Instead, the Indian Territory, along with Oklahoma Territory were both incorporated into the new state of Oklahoma in 1907. The first instance occurred while the nation still operated under the Articles of Confederation. The State of Franklin existed for several years, not long after the end of the American Revolution, but was never recognized by the Confederation Congress, which ultimately recognized North Carolina's claim of sovereignty over the area. The territory comprising Franklin later became part of the Southwest Territory, and ultimately the state of Tennessee. \n Additionally, the entry of several states into the Union was delayed due to distinctive complicating factors. Among them, Michigan Territory, which petitioned Congress for statehood in 1835, was not admitted to the Union until 1837, due to a boundary dispute with the adjoining state of Ohio. The Republic of Texas requested annexation to the United States in 1837, but fears about potential conflict with Mexico delayed the admission of Texas for nine years.[49] Statehood for Kansas Territory was held up for several years (1854–61) due to a series of internal violent conflicts involving anti-slavery and pro-slavery factions. West Virginia's bid for statehood was also delayed over slavery, and was settled when it agreed to adopt a gradual abolition plan.[50]\n Further information: Historic regions of the United States and List of U.S. state partition proposals \n Possible new states Further information: 51st state \n Puerto Rico Main articles: Political status of Puerto Rico and Proposed political status for Puerto Rico \n Puerto Rico referred to itself as the \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" in the English version of its constitution, and as \"Estado Libre Asociado\" (literally, Associated Free State) in the Spanish version. \n As with any non-state territory of the United States, its residents do not have voting representation in the federal government. Puerto Rico has limited representation in Congress in the form of a Resident Commissioner, a delegate with limited voting rights in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, and no voting rights otherwise.[51]\n A non-binding referendum on statehood, independence, or a new option for an associated territory (different from the current status) was held on November 6, 2012. Sixty one percent (61%) of voters chose the statehood option, while one third of the ballots were submitted blank.[53]\n On December 11, 2012, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the President and the Congress of the United States to respond to the referendum of the people of Puerto Rico, held on November 6, 2012, to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit Puerto Rico as a State.[54]\n Another status referendum was held on June 11, 2017, in which 97% percent of voters chose statehood. Turnout was low, as only 23% of voters went to the polls, with advocates of both continued territorial status and independence urging voters to boycott it.[55]\n On June 27, 2018, the H.R. 6246 Act was introduced on the U.S. House with the purpose of respond to, and comply with, the democratic will of the United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico as expressed in the plebiscites held on November 6, 2012, and June 11, 2017, by setting forth the terms for the admission of the territory of Puerto Rico as a State of the Union.[56] The act has 37 original cosponsors between Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.[57]\n Washington, D.C. Main article: District of Columbia statehood movement \n The intention of the Founding Fathers was that the United States capital should be at a neutral site, not giving favor to any existing state; as a result, the District of Columbia was created in 1800 to serve as the seat of government. As it is not a state, the district does not have representation in the Senate and has a non-voting delegate in the House; neither does it have a sovereign elected government. Additionally, prior to ratification of the 23rd Amendment in 1961, district citizens did not get the right to vote in Presidential elections. \n Some residents of the District support statehood of some form for that jurisdiction – either statehood for the whole district or for the inhabited part, with the remainder remaining under federal jurisdiction. In November 2016, Washington, D.C. residents voted in a statehood referendum in which 86% of voters supported statehood for Washington, D.C.[58] For statehood to be achieved, it must be approved by Congress and signed by the President.[59]\n Others Other possible new states are Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, both of which are unincorporated organized territories of the United States. Also, either the Northern Mariana Islands or American Samoa, an unorganized, unincorporated territory, could seek statehood. \n Secession from the Union Main article: Secession in the United States \n The Constitution is silent on the issue of whether a state can secede from the Union. Its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation, stated that the United States \"shall be perpetual.\" The question of whether or not individual states held the unilateral right to secession was a passionately debated feature of the nations's political discourse from early in its history, and remained a difficult and divisive topic until the American Civil War. In 1860 and 1861, 11 southern states each declared secession from the United States, and joined together to form the Confederate States of America (CSA). Following the defeat of Confederate forces by Union armies in 1865, those states were brought back into the Union during the ensuing Reconstruction Era. The federal government never recognized the sovereignty of the CSA, or the validity of the ordinances of secession adopted by the seceding states.[5][60]\n Following the war, the United States Supreme Court, in Texas v. White (1869), held that states did not have the right to secede and that any act of secession was legally void. Drawing on the Preamble to the Constitution, which states that the Constitution was intended to \"form a more perfect union\" and speaks of the people of the United States in effect as a single body politic, as well as the language of the Articles of Confederation, the Supreme Court maintained that states did not have a right to secede. However, the court's reference in the same decision to the possibility of such changes occurring \"through revolution, or through consent of the States,\" essentially means that this decision holds that no state has a right to unilaterally decide to leave the Union.[5][60]\n Commonwealths Main article: Commonwealth (U.S. state) \n Four states – Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia – adopted constitutions early in their post-colonial existence identifying themselves as commonwealths, rather than states. These commonwealths are states, but legally, each is a commonwealth because the term is contained in its constitution.[61] As a result, \"commonwealth\" is used in all public and other state writings, actions or activities within their bounds. \n The term, which refers to a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people, was first used in Virginia during the Interregnum, the 1649–60 period between the reigns of Charles I and Charles II during which parliament's Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector established a republican government known as the Commonwealth of England. Virginia became a royal colony again in 1660, and the word was dropped from the full title. When Virginia adopted its first constitution on June 29, 1776, it was reintroduced. Pennsylvania followed suit when it drew up a constitution later that year, as did Massachusetts, in 1780, and Kentucky, in 1792.[61]\n The U.S. territories of the Northern Marianas and Puerto Rico are also referred to as commonwealths. This designation does have a legal status different from that of the 50 states. Both of these commonwealths are unincorporated territories of the United States. \n Origins of states' names Further information: List of state and territory name etymologies of the United States \n  A map showing the source languages of state names\n \n\n The 50 states have taken their names from a wide variety of languages. Twenty-four state names originate from Native American languages. Of these, eight are from Algonquian languages, seven are from Siouan languages, three are from Iroquoian languages, one is from Uto-Aztecan languages and five others are from other indigenous languages. Hawaii's name is derived from the PolynesianHawaiian language. \n Of the remaining names, 22 are from European languages: Seven from Latin (mainly Latinized forms of English names), the rest are from English, Spanish and French. Eleven states are named after individual people, including seven named for royalty and one named after a President of the United States. The origins of six state names are unknown or disputed. Several of the states that derive their names from (corrupted) names used for Native peoples, have retained the plural ending of \"s\". \n Geography Borders The borders of the 13 original states were largely determined by colonial charters. Their western boundaries were subsequently modified as the states ceded their western land claims to the Federal government during the 1780s and 1790s. Many state borders beyond those of the original 13 were set by Congress as it created territories, divided them, and over time, created states within them. Territorial and new state lines often followed various geographic features (such as rivers or mountain range peaks), and were influenced by settlement or transportation patterns. At various times, national borders with territories formerly controlled by other countries (British North America, New France, New Spain including Spanish Florida, and Russian America) became institutionalized as the borders of U.S. states. In the West, relatively arbitrary straight lines following latitude and longitude often prevail, due to the sparseness of settlement west of the Mississippi River. \n Once established, most state borders have, with few exceptions, been generally stable. Only two states, Missouri (Platte Purchase) and Nevada, grew appreciably after statehood. Several of the original states ceded land, over a several year period, to the Federal government, which in turn became the Northwest Territory, Southwest Territory, and Mississippi Territory. In 1791 Maryland and Virginia ceded land to create the District of Columbia (Virginia's portion was returned in 1847). In 1850, Texas ceded a large swath of land to the federal government. Additionally, Massachusetts and Virginia (on two occasions), have lost land, in each instance to form a new state. \n There have been numerous other minor adjustments to state boundaries over the years due to improved surveys, resolution of ambiguous or disputed boundary definitions, or minor mutually agreed boundary adjustments for administrative convenience or other purposes.[41] Occasionally, either Congress or the U.S. Supreme Court has had to settle state border disputes. One notable example is the case New Jersey v. New York, in which New Jersey won roughly 90% of Ellis Island from New York in 1998.[63]\n Regional grouping Further information: List of regions of the United States \n States may be grouped in regions; there are many variations and possible groupings. Many are defined in law or regulations by the federal government. For example, the United States Census Bureau defines four statistical regions, with nine divisions.[64] The Census Bureau region definition is \"widely used ... for data collection and analysis,\"[65] and is the most commonly used classification system.[66][67][68] Other multi-state regions are unofficial, and defined by geography or cultural affinity rather than by state lines. \n See also References   ^\"Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017\".

Numerous cultures formed, and many disappeared before 1500. The arrival of Christopher Columbus in the year 1492 started the European colonization of the Americas. Most colonies were formed after 1600, and the early records and writings of Johnathan Winthrop make the United States the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded.[1] By the 1760s, thirteen British colonies contained 2.5 million people along the Atlantic coast east of the Appalachian Mountains. After defeating France, the British government imposed a series of new taxes after 1765, rejecting the colonists' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval (see Stamp Act 1765). Tax resistance, especially the Boston Tea Party (1773), led to punitive laws by Parliament designed to end self-government in Massachusetts. \n Armed conflict began in 1775. In 1776 in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congressdeclared the independence of the colonies as the United States. Led by General George Washington, it won the Revolutionary War with large support from France. The peace treaty of 1783 gave the new nation the land east of the Mississippi River (except Canada and Florida). The Articles of Confederation established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability, as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A convention in 1787 wrote a new Constitution that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a Bill of Rights was added to guarantee inalienable rights. With Washington as the first president and Alexander Hamilton his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. Purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States. A second and final war with Britain was fought in 1812, which solidified national pride. \n Encouraged by the notion of manifest destiny, U.S. territory expanded all the way to the Pacific coast. While the United States was large in terms of area, its population by 1790 was only 4 million. However, it grew rapidly, reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 321 million in 2015. Economic growth in terms of overall GDP was even greater. However compared to European powers, the nation's military strength was relatively limited in peacetime before 1940. The expansion was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for yeoman farmers and slave owners. The expansion of slavery was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states north of the Mason–Dixon line by 1804, but the South continued to profit from the institution, mostly from production of cotton. RepublicanAbraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860 on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery. \n Seven Southern slave states rebelled and created the foundation of the Confederacy. Its attack of Fort Sumter against the Union forces started the Civil War (1861–1865). Confederate defeat led to the impoverishment of the South and the abolition of slavery. In the Reconstruction Era (1863–1877), legal and voting rights were extended to freed slaves. The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, it gained the explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white Democrats regained their power in the South in 1877, often by paramilitary suppression of voting, they passed Jim Crow laws to maintain white supremacy, and new disfranchising constitutions that prevented most African Americans and many poor whites from voting. This continued until gains of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and passage of federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights were made. \n The United States became the world's leading industrial power at the turn of the 20th century due to an outburst of entrepreneurship in the Northeast and Midwest and the arrival of millions of immigrant workers and farmers from Europe. The national railroad network was completed and large-scale mining and factories industrialized the Northeast and Midwest. Mass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency and traditional politics stimulated the Progressive movement, from the 1890s to 1920s, which led to many reforms including the 16th to 19th constitutional amendments, which brought the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, prohibition, and women's suffrage. Initially neutral during World War I, the United States declared war on Germany in 1917 and funded the Allied victory the following year. Women obtained the right to vote in 1920, with Native Americans obtaining citizenship and the right to vote in 1924. \n After a prosperous decade in the 1920s, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide Great Depression. Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt ended the Republican dominance of the White House and implemented his New Deal programs, which included relief for the unemployed, support for farmers, Social Security and a minimum wage. The New Deal defined modern American liberalism. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States entered World War II and financed the Allied war effort and helped defeat Nazi Germany in the European theater. Its involvement culminated in using newly invented nuclear weapons on two Japanese cities to defeat Imperial Japan in the Pacific theater. \n The United States and the Soviet Union emerged as rival superpowers in the aftermath of World War II. During the Cold War, the two countries confronted each other indirectly in the arms race, the Space Race, proxy wars, and propaganda campaigns. The purpose of this was to stop the spread of communism. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the Civil Rights Movement, another wave of social reforms was enacted by enforcing the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African-Americans and other racial minorities. The Cold War ended when the Soviet Union was officially dissolved in 1991, leaving the United States as the world's only superpower. \n After the Cold War, the United States has been focusing on modern conflicts in the Middle East. The beginning of the 21st century saw the September 11 attacks carried out by Al-Qaeda in 2001, which was later followed by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the United States had its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, which was followed by slower-than-usual rates of economic growth during the 2010s. \n Contents\n\n  Pre-Columbian Era[edit]  Main articles: Prehistory of the United States, History of Native Americans in the United States, and Pre-Columbian era \n See also: Native Americans in the United States \n  This map shows the approximate location of the ice-free corridor and specific Paleoindian sites (Clovis theory).\n \n\n It is not definitively known how or when the Native Americans first settled the Americas and the present-day United States. The prevailing theory proposes that people migrated from Eurasia across Beringia, a land bridge that connected Siberia to present-day Alaska during the Ice Age, and then spread southward throughout the Americas. This migration may have begun as early as 30,000 years ago and continued through to about 10,000+ years ago, when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the ending of the last glacial period.[3] These early inhabitants, called Paleoamericans, soon diversified into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes. \n The pre-Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continents, spanning the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic period to European colonization during the early modern period. While technically referring to the era before Christopher Columbus' voyages of 1492 to 1504, in practice the term usually includes the history of American indigenous cultures until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades or even centuries after Columbus's initial landing. \n  Native American development prior to European contact[edit]  Main article: History of Native Americans in the United States \n  The Cultural areas of pre-Columbian North America, according to Alfred Kroeber.\n \n\n Native American cultures are not normally included in characterizations of advanced stone age cultures as \"Neolithic,\" which is a category that more often includes only the cultures in Eurasia, Africa, and other regions. The archaeological periods used are the classifications of archaeological periods and cultures established in Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips' 1958 book Method and Theory in American Archaeology. They divided the archaeological record in the Americas into five phases;[4] see Archaeology of the Americas. \n The Clovis culture, a megafauna hunting culture, is primarily identified by use of fluted spear points. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near Clovis, New Mexico. The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. The culture is identified by the distinctive Clovis point, a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute, by which it was inserted into a shaft. Dating of Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of carbon dating methods. Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of 11,050 and 10,800 radiocarbon years B.P. (roughly 9100 to 8850 BCE). \n Numerous Paleoindian cultures occupied North America, with some arrayed around the Great Plains and Great Lakes of the modern United States of America and Canada, as well as adjacent areas to the West and Southwest. According to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, they have been living on this continent since their genesis, described by a wide range of traditional creation stories. Other tribes have stories that recount migrations across long tracts of land and a great river, believed to be the Mississippi River.[5] Genetic and linguistic data connect the indigenous people of this continent with ancient northeast Asians. Archeological and linguistic data has enabled scholars to discover some of the migrations within the Americas. \n  A Folsom point for a spear.\n \n\n The Folsom Tradition was characterized by use of Folsom points as projectile tips, and activities known from kill sites, where slaughter and butchering of bison took place. Folsom tools were left behind between 9000 BCE and 8000 BCE.[6]\n Na-Dené-speaking peoples entered North America starting around 8000 BCE, reaching the Pacific Northwest by 5000 BCE,[7] and from there migrating along the Pacific Coast and into the interior. Linguists, anthropologists and archeologists believe their ancestors comprised a separate migration into North America, later than the first Paleo-Indians. They migrated into Alaska and northern Canada, south along the Pacific Coast, into the interior of Canada, and south to the Great Plains and the American Southwest. \n They were the earliest ancestors of the Athabascan- speaking peoples, including the present-day and historical Navajo and Apache. They constructed large multi-family dwellings in their villages, which were used seasonally. People did not live there year-round, but for the summer to hunt and fish, and to gather food supplies for the winter.[8] The Oshara Tradition people lived from 5500 BCE to 600 CE. They were part of the Southwestern Archaic Tradition centered in north-central New Mexico, the San Juan Basin, the Rio Grande Valley, southern Colorado, and southeastern Utah. \n Since the 1990s, archeologists have explored and dated eleven Middle Archaic sites in present-day Louisiana and Florida at which early cultures built complexes with multiple earthworkmounds; they were societies of hunter-gatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary according to the theory of Neolithic Revolution to sustain such large villages over long periods. The prime example is Watson Brake in northern Louisiana, whose 11-mound complex is dated to 3500 BCE, making it the oldest, dated site in the Americas for such complex construction. It is nearly 2,000 years older than the Poverty Point site. Construction of the mounds went on for 500 years until it was abandoned about 2800 BCE, probably due to changing environmental conditions.[9]\n Poverty Point culture is a Late Archaic archaeological culture that inhabited the area of the lower Mississippi Valley and surrounding Gulf Coast. The culture thrived from 2200 BCE to 700 BCE, during the Late Archaic period.[10] Evidence of this culture has been found at more than 100 sites, from the major complex at Poverty Point (a UNESCOWorld Heritage Site) across a 100-mile (160 km) range to the Jaketown Site near Belzoni, Mississippi. \n  The K'alyaanTotem Pole of the Tlingit Kiks.ádi Clan, erected at Sitka National Historical Park to commemorate the lives lost in the 1804 Battle of Sitka.\n \n\n Poverty Point is a 1 square mile (2.6 km2) complex of six major earthwork concentric rings, with additional platform mounds at the site. Artifacts show the people traded with other Native Americans located from Georgia to the Great Lakes region. This is one among numerous mound sites of complex indigenous cultures throughout the Mississippi and Ohio valleys. They were one of several succeeding cultures often referred to as mound builders. \n The Woodland period of North Americanpre-Columbian cultures refers to the time period from roughly 1000 BCE to 1000 CE in the eastern part of North America. The term \"Woodland\" was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites dated between the Archaic period and the Mississippian cultures. The Hopewell tradition is the term for the common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern United States from 200 BCE to 500 CE.[11]\n The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations, who were connected by a common network of trade routes, known as the Hopewell Exchange System. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern United States into the southeastern Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange; most activity was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes. The Hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over the United States. \n The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were of many nations and tribal affiliations, each with distinctive cultural and political identities, but they shared certain beliefs, traditions and practices, such as the centrality of salmon as a resource and spiritual symbol. Their gift-giving feast, potlatch, is a highly complex event where people gather in order to commemorate special events such as the raising of a Totem pole or the appointment or election of a new chief. The most famous artistic feature of the culture is the Totem pole, with carvings of animals and other characters to commemorate cultural beliefs, legends, and notable events. \n  Major cultures[edit]    Grave Creek Mound, located in Moundsville, West Virginia, is one of the largest conical mounds in the United States. It was built by the Adena culture.\n \n\n  A map showing the extent of the Coles Creek cultural period and some important sites.\n \n\n  The Great House at the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument.\n \n\n  Map of the Five Nations of the Iroquois (from the Darlington Collection).\n \n\n  Native development in Hawaii[edit]    Kamehameha I, founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n \n\n Main article: History of Hawaii \n Native development in Hawaii begins with the settlement of Polynesians between the 1st and 10th centuries. Around 1200 AD Tahitian explorers found and began settling the area as well. This became the rise of the Hawaiian civilization and would be separated from the rest of the world for another 500 years until the arrival of the British. Europeans under the British explorer Captain James Cook arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778. Within five years of contact, European military technology would help Kamehameha I conquer most of the people, and eventually unify the islands for the first time; establishing the Kingdom of Hawaii. \n  Colonial period[edit]  Main article: Colonial history of the United States \n  European territorial claims in North America, c. 1750  France\n  Great Britain\n  Spain\n \n \n\n After a period of exploration sponsored by major European nations, the first successful English settlement was established in 1607. Europeans brought horses, cattle, and hogs to the Americas and, in turn, took back to Europe maize, turkeys, potatoes, tobacco, beans, and squash. Many explorers and early settlers died after being exposed to new diseases in the Americas. The effects of new Eurasian diseases carried by the colonists, especially smallpox and measles, were much worse for the Native Americans, as they had no immunity to them. They suffered epidemics and died in very large numbers, usually before large-scale European settlement began. Their societies were disrupted and hollowed out by the scale of deaths.\n  Spanish, Dutch, and French colonization[edit]  Main articles: Spanish colonization of the Americas, Dutch colonization of the Americas, and French colonization of the Americas \n Spanish explorers were the first Europeans with Christopher Columbus's second expedition, to reach Puerto Rico on November 19, 1493; others reached Florida in 1513. Spanish expeditions quickly reached the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Grand Canyon and the Great Plains. In 1540, Hernando de Soto undertook an extensive exploration of the Southeast.\n  \n The Letter of Christopher Columbus on the Discovery of America to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain \n \n\n In 1540, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado explored from Arizona to central Kansas. Small Spanish settlements eventually grew to become important cities, such as San Antonio, Texas; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Tucson, Arizona; Los Angeles, California; and San Francisco, California.\n  Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.\n \n\n New Netherland was a 17th-century Dutch colony centered on present-day New York City and the Hudson River Valley; the Dutch traded furs with the Native Americans to the north. The colony served as a barrier to expansion from New England. Despite being Calvinists and building the Reformed Church in America, the Dutch were tolerant of other religions and cultures.[30]\n The colony, which was taken over by Britain in 1664, left an enduring legacy on American cultural and political life. This includes secular broad-mindedness and mercantile pragmatism in the city as well as rural traditionalism in the countryside (typified by the story of Rip Van Winkle). Notable Americans of Dutch descent include Martin Van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt and the Frelinghuysens.[30]\n New France was the area colonized by France from 1534 to 1763. There were few permanent settlers outside Quebec and Acadia, but the French had far-reaching trading relationships with Native Americans throughout the Great Lakes and Midwest. French villages along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers were based in farming communities that served as a granary for Gulf Coast settlements. The French established plantations in Louisiana along with settling New Orleans, Mobile and Biloxi. \n The Wabanaki Confederacy were military allies of New France through the four French and Indian Wars while the British colonies were allied with the Iroquois Confederacy. During the French and Indian War – the North American theater of the Seven Years' War – New England fought successfully against French Acadia. The British removed Acadians from Acadia (Nova Scotia) and replaced them with New England Planters.[31] Eventually, some Acadians resettled in Louisiana, where they developed a distinctive rural Cajun culture that still exists. They became American citizens in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase. Other French villages along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers were absorbed when the Americans started arriving after 1770, or settlers moved west to escape them.[33] French influence and language in New Orleans, Louisiana and the Gulf Coast was more enduring; New Orleans was notable for its large population of free people of color before the Civil War. \n  British colonization[edit]  Further information: British colonization of the Americas \n  \n Excerpt of a Description of New England by English explorer John Smith, published in 1616.\n \n\n  The Mayflower, which transported Pilgrims to the New World. During the first winter at Plymouth, about half of the Pilgrims died.[34] \n \n\n The strip of land along the eastern seacoast was settled primarily by English colonists in the 17th century along with much smaller numbers of Dutch and Swedes. Colonial America was defined by a severe labor shortage that employed forms of unfree labor such as slavery and indentured servitude and by a British policy of benign neglect (salutary neglect). Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America arrived as indentured servants.[35] Salutary neglect permitted the development of an American spirit distinct from that of its European founders.[36]\n   Squanto known for having been an early liaison between the native populations in Southern New England and the Mayflower settlers, who made their settlement at the site of Squanto's former summer village.\n \n\n The first successful English colony, Jamestown, was established in 1607 on the James River in Virginia. Jamestown languished for decades until a new wave of settlers arrived in the late 17th century and established commercial agriculture based on tobacco. Between the late 1610s and the Revolution, the British shipped an estimated 50,000 to 120,000 convicts to their American colonies.[37] A severe instance of conflict was the 1622 Powhatan uprising in Virginia in which Native Americans killed hundreds of English settlers. The largest conflicts between Native Americans and English settlers in the 17th century were King Philip's War in New England[38] and the Yamasee War in South Carolina.[39]\n   Jennie Augusta Brownscombe, The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth, 1914, Pilgrim Hall Museum, Plymouth, Massachusetts\n \n\n New England was initially settled primarily by Puritans. The Pilgrims established a settlement in 1620 at Plymouth Colony, which was followed by the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. The Middle Colonies, consisting of the present-day states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, were characterized by a large degree of diversity. The first attempted English settlement south of Virginia was the Province of Carolina, with Georgia Colony – the last of the Thirteen Colonies – established in 1733.[40]\n  The Indian massacre of Jamestown settlers in 1622. Soon the colonists in the South feared all natives as enemies.\n \n\n The colonies were characterized by people primarily of the Judeo-Christian faiths, with many Congregationalists in New England, German and Dutch Reformed in the Middle Colonies, Catholics in Maryland, and Scots-Irish Presbyterians on the frontier. Sephardic Jews were among early settlers in cities of New England and the South. Many immigrants arrived as religious refugees: French Huguenots settled in New York, Virginia and the Carolinas. Many royal officials and merchants were Anglicans.[41]\n Religiosity expanded greatly after the First Great Awakening, a religious revival in the 1740s led by preachers such as Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield. American Evangelicals affected by the Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted within new believers an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and carried the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic, setting the stage for the Second Great Awakening beginning in the late 1790s. In the early stages, evangelicals in the South such as Methodists and Baptists preached for religious freedom and abolition of slavery; they converted many slaves and recognized some as preachers. \n   John Gadsby Chapman, The Baptism of Pocahontas (1840). A copy is on display in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.\n \n\n Each of the 13 American colonies had a slightly different governmental structure. Typically, a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from London who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected legislature to vote taxes and make laws. By the 18th century, the American colonies were growing very rapidly as a result of low death rates along with ample supplies of land and food. The colonies were richer than most parts of Britain, and attracted a steady flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who arrived as indentured servants.[43]\n The tobacco and rice plantations imported African slaves for labor from the British colonies in the West Indies, and by the 1770s African slaves comprised a fifth of the American population. The question of independence from Britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed British military support against the French and Spanish powers. Those threats were gone by 1765. London regarded the American colonies as existing for the benefit of the mother country. This policy is known as mercantilism.[43]\n  18th century[edit]   Map of the British and French settlements in North America in 1750, before the French and Indian War \n \n\n An upper-class, with wealth based on large plantations operated by slave labor, and holding significant political power and even control over the churches, emerged in South Carolina and Virginia. A unique class system operated in upstate New York, where Dutch tenant farmers rented land from very wealthy Dutch proprietors, such as the Rensselaer family. The other colonies were more equalitarian, with Pennsylvania being representative. By the mid-18th century Pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited deference to its small upper-class. A writer in the Pennsylvania Journal in 1756 summed it up: \n The People of this Province are generally of the middling Sort, and at present pretty much upon a Level. They are chiefly industrious Farmers, Artificers or Men in Trade; they enjoy in are fond of Freedom, and the meanest among them thinks he has a right to Civility from the greatest.[44]\n  Political integration and autonomy[edit]    Join, or Die: This 1756 political cartoon by Benjamin Franklin urged the colonies to join together during the French and Indian War.\n \n\n The French and Indian War (1754–63) was a watershed event in the political development of the colonies. It was also part of the larger Seven Years' War. The influence of the main rivals of the British Crown in the colonies and Canada, the French and North American Indians, was significantly reduced with the territory of the Thirteen Colonies expanding into New France both in Canada and the Louisiana Territory. Moreover, the war effort resulted in greater political integration of the colonies, as reflected in the Albany Congress and symbolized by Benjamin Franklin's call for the colonies to \"Join or Die\". Franklin was a man of many inventions – one of which was the concept of a United States of America, which emerged after 1765 and was realized in July 1776.[45]\n Following Britain's acquisition of French territory in North America, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 with the goal of organizing the new North American empire and protecting the native Indians from colonial expansion into western lands beyond the Appalachian Mountains. In ensuing years, strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the Crown. The British Parliament passed the Stamp Act of 1765, imposing a tax on the colonies without going through the colonial legislatures. The issue was drawn: did Parliament have this right to tax Americans who were not represented in it? Crying \"No taxation without representation\", the colonists refused to pay the taxes as tensions escalated in the late 1760s and early 1770s.[46]\n  An 1846 painting of the 1773 Boston Tea Party.\n \n\n  The population density in the American Colonies in 1775.\n \n\n The Boston Tea Party in 1773 was a direct action by activists in the town of Boston to protest against the new tax on tea. Parliament quickly responded the next year with the Coercive Acts, stripping Massachusetts of its historic right of self-government and putting it under army rule, which sparked outrage and resistance in all thirteen colonies. Patriot leaders from all 13 colonies convened the First Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance to the Coercive Acts. The Congress called for a boycott of British trade, published a list of rights and grievances, and petitioned the king for redress of those grievances.[47] The appeal to the Crown had no effect, and so the Second Continental Congress was convened in 1775 to organize the defense of the colonies against the British Army. \n Ordinary folk became insurgents against the British even though they were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered. They held very strongly a sense of \"rights\" that they felt the British were deliberately violating – rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested in the arrival in Boston of the British Army to punish the Bostonians. This heightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge. They had faith that God was on their side.[48]\n The American Revolutionary War began at Concord and Lexington in April 1775 when the British tried to seize ammunition supplies and arrest the Patriot leaders. \n In terms of political values, the Americans were largely united on a concept called Republicanism, that rejected aristocracy and emphasized civic duty and a fear of corruption. For the Founding Fathers, according to one team of historians, \"republicanism represented more than a particular form of government. It was a way of life, a core ideology, an uncompromising commitment to liberty, and a total rejection of aristocracy.\"[49]\n  American Revolution[edit]  Main articles: American Revolution and History of the United States (1776–1789) \n See also: Commemoration of the American Revolution \n  \n Reading of The Declaration of Independence originally written by Thomas Jefferson, presented on July 4th 1776.\n \n\n   Washington's surprise crossing of the Delaware River in December 1776 was a major comeback after the loss of New York City; his army defeated the British in two battles and recaptured New Jersey.\n \n\n The Thirteen Colonies began a rebellion against British rule in 1775 and proclaimed their independence in 1776 as the United States of America. In the American Revolutionary War (1775–83) the Americans captured the British invasion army at Saratoga in 1777, secured the Northeast and encouraged the French to make a military alliance with the United States. France brought in Spain and the Netherlands, thus balancing the military and naval forces on each side as Britain had no allies.[50]\n General George Washington (1732–99) proved an excellent organizer and administrator who worked successfully with Congress and the state governors, selecting and mentoring his senior officers, supporting and training his troops, and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army. His biggest challenge was logistics, since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers. \n As a battlefield tactician, Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.[51]\n   John Trumbull's Declaration of Independence \n \n\n The Loyalists, whom the British counted upon too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized. As the war ended, Washington watched proudly as the final British army quietly sailed out of New York City in November 1783, taking the Loyalist leadership with them. Washington astonished the world when, instead of seizing power for himself, he retired quietly to his farm in Virginia.[51] Political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset observes, \"The United States was the first major colony successfully to revolt against colonial rule. In this sense, it was the first 'new nation'.\"\n On July 2, 1776, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, declared the independence of the colonies by adopting the resolution from Richard Henry Lee, that stated: \n That these United Colonies are, and of right out to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; that measures should be immediately taken for procuring the assistance of foreign powers, and a Confederation be formed to bind the colonies more closely together. \n \n\n On July 4, 1776 they adopted the Declaration of Independence and this date is celebrated as the nation's birthday. Historian George Billias says: \n Independence amounted to a new status of interdependence: the United States was now a sovereign nation entitled to the privileges and responsibilities that came with that status. America thus became a member of the international community, which meant becoming a maker of treaties and alliances, a military ally in diplomacy, and a partner in foreign trade on a more equal basis.[53] \n On September 9, 1776, Congress officially changed the nation's name to the United States of America. Until this point, the nation was known as the \"United Colonies of America\"[54]\n The new nation was founded on Enlightenment ideals of liberalism in what Thomas Jefferson called the unalienable rights to \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\", and dedicated strongly to republican principles. Republicanism emphasized the people are sovereign (not hereditary kings), demanded civic duty, feared corruption, and rejected any aristocracy.[55]\n  Early years of the republic[edit]  Main article: History of the United States (1789–1849) \n See also: First Party System and Second Party System \n  Confederation and Constitution[edit]   \n Reading of the United States Constitution of 1787\n \n\n Further information: Articles of Confederation and History of the United States Constitution \n  Economic growth in America per capita income. Index with 1700 set as 100.\n \n\n In the 1780s the national government was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress and became territories. With the migration of settlers to the Northwest, soon they became states. Nationalists worried that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the Shays' Rebellion of 1786 in Massachusetts.[56]\n Nationalists – most of them war veterans – organized in every state and convinced Congress to call the Philadelphia Convention in 1787. The delegates from every state wrote a new Constitution that created a much more powerful and efficient central government, one with a strong president, and powers of taxation. The new government reflected the prevailing republican ideals of guarantees of individual liberty and of constraining the power of government through a system of separation of powers.[56]\n The Congress was given authority to ban the international slave trade after 20 years (which it did in 1807). A compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths of the number of slaves in each state's total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade. \n To assuage the Anti-Federalists who feared a too-powerful national government, the nation adopted the United States Bill of Rights in 1791. Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution, it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice, jury trials, and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights (which were not specified).[57]\n  President George Washington[edit]    George Washington legacy remains among the two or three greatest in American history, as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, hero of the Revolution, and the first President of the United States.\n \n\n  \n Reading of the Farewell address of President George Washington, 1796\n \n\n George Washington – a renowned hero of the American Revolutionary War, commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and president of the Constitutional Convention – became the first President of the United States under the new Constitution in 1789. The national capital moved from New York to Philadelphia in 1790 and finally settled in Washington DC in 1800. \n The major accomplishments of the Washington Administration were creating a strong national government that was recognized without question by all Americans.[58] His government, following the vigorous leadership of Treasury SecretaryAlexander Hamilton, assumed the debts of the states (the debt holders received federal bonds), created the Bank of the United States to stabilize the financial system, and set up a uniform system of tariffs (taxes on imports) and other taxes to pay off the debt and provide a financial infrastructure. To support his programs Hamilton created a new political party – the first in the world based on voters – the Federalist Party. \n Thomas Jefferson and James Madison formed an opposition Republican Party (usually called the Democratic-Republican Party by political scientists). Hamilton and Washington presented the country in 1794 with the Jay Treaty that reestablished good relations with Britain. The Jeffersonians vehemently protested, and the voters aligned behind one party or the other, thus setting up the First Party System.\n  Depiction of election-day activities in Philadelphia by John Lewis Krimmel, 1815\n \n\n  Federalists promoted business, financial and commercial interests and wanted more trade with Britain. Republicans accused the Federalists of plans to establish a monarchy, turn the rich into a ruling class, and making the United States a pawn of the British.[59] The treaty passed, but politics became intensely heated.[60]\n Serious challenges to the new federal government included the Northwest Indian War, the ongoing Cherokee–American wars, and the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion, in which western settlers protested against a federal tax on liquor. Washington called out the state militia and personally led an army against the settlers, as the insurgents melted away and the power of the national government was firmly established.[61]\n Washington refused to serve more than two terms – setting a precedent – and in his famous farewell address, he extolled the benefits of federal government and importance of ethics and morality while warning against foreign alliances and the formation of political parties.\n John Adams, a Federalist, defeated Jefferson in the 1796 election. War loomed with France and the Federalists used the opportunity to try to silence the Republicans with the Alien and Sedition Acts, build up a large army with Hamilton at the head, and prepare for a French invasion. However, the Federalists became divided after Adams sent a successful peace mission to France that ended the Quasi-War of 1798.[59][63]\n  Slavery[edit]  Main article: Slavery in the United States \n   Slaves Waiting for Sale: Richmond, Virginia. Painted upon the sketch of 1853\n \n\n During the first two decades after the Revolutionary War, there were dramatic changes in the status of slavery among the states and an increase in the number of freed blacks. Inspired by revolutionary ideals of the equality of men and influenced by their lesser economic reliance on slavery, northern states abolished slavery. \n States of the Upper South made manumission easier, resulting in an increase in the proportion of free blacks in the Upper South (as a percentage of the total non-white population) from less than one percent in 1792 to more than 10 percent by 1810. By that date, a total of 13.5 percent of all blacks in the United States were free.[64] After that date, with the demand for slaves on the rise because of the Deep South's expanding cotton cultivation, the number of manumissions declined sharply; and an internal U.S. slave trade became an important source of wealth for many planters and traders. \n In 1809, president James Madison severed the US's involvement with the Atlantic slave trade. \n  19th century[edit]   Jeffersonian Republican Era[edit]   Jefferson saw himself as a man of the frontier and a scientist; he was keenly interested in expanding and exploring the West.\n \n\n Jefferson's major achievement as president was the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, which provided U.S. settlers with vast potential for expansion west of the Mississippi River.[65]\n Jefferson, a scientist himself, supported expeditions to explore and map the new domain, most notably the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[66] Jefferson believed deeply in republicanism and argued it should be based on the independent yeoman farmer and planter; he distrusted cities, factories and banks. He also distrusted the federal government and judges, and tried to weaken the judiciary. However he met his match in John Marshall, a Federalist from Virginia. Although the Constitution specified a Supreme Court, its functions were vague until Marshall, the Chief Justice (1801–35), defined them, especially the power to overturn acts of Congress or states that violated the Constitution, first enunciated in 1803 in Marbury v. Madison.[67]\n  War of 1812[edit]  Main article: War of 1812 \n  Territorial expansion; Louisiana Purchase in white.\n \n\n Thomas Jefferson defeated Adams for the presidency in the 1800 election. Americans were increasingly angry at the British violation of American ships' neutral rights in order to hurt France, the impressment (seizure) of 10,000 American sailors needed by the Royal Navy to fight Napoleon, and British support for hostile Indians attacking American settlers in the Midwest. They may also have desired to annex all or part of British North America.[68][69][70][71] Despite strong opposition from the Northeast, especially from Federalists who did not want to disrupt trade with Britain, Congress declared war on June 18, 1812.[73]\n  Oliver Hazard Perry's message to William Henry Harrison after the Battle of Lake Erie began with what would become one of the most famous sentences in American military history: \"We have met the enemy and they are ours\".[74] This 1865 painting by William H. Powell shows Perry transferring to a different ship during the battle.\n \n\n The war was frustrating for both sides. Both sides tried to invade the other and were repulsed. The American high command remained incompetent until the last year. The American militia proved ineffective because the soldiers were reluctant to leave home and efforts to invade Canada repeatedly failed. The British blockade ruined American commerce, bankrupted the Treasury, and further angered New Englanders, who smuggled supplies to Britain. The Americans under General William Henry Harrison finally gained naval control of Lake Erie and defeated the Indians under Tecumseh in Canada,[75] while Andrew Jackson ended the Indian threat in the Southeast. The Indian threat to expansion into the Midwest was permanently ended. The British invaded and occupied much of Maine. \n The British raided and burned Washington, but were repelled at Baltimore in 1814 – where the \"Star Spangled Banner\" was written to celebrate the American success. In upstate New York a major British invasion of New York State was turned back. Finally in early 1815 Andrew Jackson decisively defeated a major British invasion at the Battle of New Orleans, making him the most famous war hero.[76]\n With Napoleon (apparently) gone, the causes of the war had evaporated and both sides agreed to a peace that left the prewar boundaries intact. Americans claimed victory on February 18, 1815 as news came almost simultaneously of Jackson's victory of New Orleans and the peace treaty that left the prewar boundaries in place. Americans swelled with pride at success in the \"second war of independence\"; the naysayers of the antiwar Federalist Party were put to shame and the party never recovered. The Indians were the big losers; they never gained the independent nationhood Britain had promised and no longer posed a serious threat as settlers poured into the Midwest.[76]\n  Era of Good Feelings[edit]  Main article: Era of Good Feelings \n  Era of Good Feelings\n \n\n As strong opponents of the war, the Federalists held the Hartford Convention in 1814 that hinted at disunion. National euphoria after the victory at New Orleans ruined the prestige of the Federalists and they no longer played a significant role as a political party.[77] President Madison and most Republicans realized they were foolish to let the Bank of the United States close down, for its absence greatly hindered the financing of the war. So, with the assistance of foreign bankers, they chartered the Second Bank of the United States in 1816.[78][79]\n  Settlers crossing the Plains of Nebraska.\n \n\n The Republicans also imposed tariffs designed to protect the infant industries that had been created when Britain was blockading the U.S. With the collapse of the Federalists as a party, the adoption of many Federalist principles by the Republicans, and the systematic policy of President James Monroe in his two terms (1817–25) to downplay partisanship, the nation entered an Era of Good Feelings, with far less partisanship than before (or after), and closed out the First Party System.[78][79]\n The Monroe Doctrine, expressed in 1823, proclaimed the United States' opinion that European powers should no longer colonize or interfere in the Americas. This was a defining moment in the foreign policy of the United States. The Monroe Doctrine was adopted in response to American and British fears over Russian and French expansion into the Western Hemisphere.[80]\n In 1832, President Andrew Jackson, 7th President of the United States, ran for a second term under the slogan \"Jackson and no bank\" and did not renew the charter of the Second Bank of the United States of America, ending the Bank in 1836.[81] Jackson was convinced that central banking was used by the elite to take advantage of the average American, and instead implemented state banks, popularly known as \"pet banks\".[81]\n  Indian removal[edit]  Main article: Indian removal \n  The Indian Removal Act resulted in the transplantation of several Native American tribes and the Trail of Tears.\n \n\n In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which authorized the president to negotiate treaties that exchanged Native American tribal lands in the eastern states for lands west of the Mississippi River. Its goal was primarily to remove Native Americans, including the Five Civilized Tribes, from the American Southeast; they occupied land that settlers wanted. Jacksonian Democrats demanded the forcible removal of native populations who refused to acknowledge state laws to reservations in the West; Whigs and religious leaders opposed the move as inhumane. Thousands of deaths resulted from the relocations, as seen in the CherokeeTrail of Tears.[83] The Trail of Tears resulted in approximately 2,000–8,000 of the 16,543 relocated Cherokee perishing along the way.[84][85] Many of the Seminole Indians in Florida refused to move west; they fought the Army for years in the Seminole Wars. \n  Second Party System[edit]  Main articles: Second Party System and Presidency of Andrew Jackson \n  Henry Clay\n \n\n After the First Party System of Federalists and Republicans withered away in the 1820s, the stage was set for the emergence of a new party system based on well organized local parties that appealed for the votes of (almost) all adult white men. The former Jeffersonian (Democratic-Republican) party split into factions. They split over the choice of a successor to President James Monroe, and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, became the Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in 1828: \n Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party...and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American politics.[86]\n Opposing factions led by Henry Clay helped form the Whig Party. The Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery. \n Behind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats: \n   Horace Greeley's New York Tribune—the leading Whig paper—endorsed Clay for President and Fillmore for Governor, 1844.\n \n\n The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"corrupt bargain\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. ... Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual (the \"common man,\" i.e. the artisan and the ordinary farmer) by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.[87][88]\n  Second Great Awakening[edit]  Main article: Second Great Awakening \n  A drawing of a Protestant camp meeting, 1829.\n \n\n The Second Great Awakening was a Protestant revival movement that affected the entire nation during the early 19th century and led to rapid church growth. The movement began around 1790, gained momentum by 1800, and, after 1820 membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations, whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the 1840s.[89]\n It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age. The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements – including abolitionism and temperance designed to remove the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[90]\n  Abolitionism[edit]  Main article: Abolitionism in the United States \n  Officers and men of the Irish-Catholic69th New York Volunteer Regiment attend Catholic services in 1861.\n \n\n  \n Recording of Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave by Frederick Douglass, Chapter 7\n \n\n After 1840 the abolitionist movement redefined itself as a crusade against the sin of slave ownership. It mobilized support (especially among religious women in the Northeast affected by the Second Great Awakening). William Lloyd Garrison, a radical abolitionist, published the most influential of the many anti-slavery newspapers, The Liberator, while Frederick Douglass, an ex-slave, began writing for that newspaper around 1840 and started his own abolitionist newspaper North Star in 1847.[91] The great majority of anti-slavery activists, such as Abraham Lincoln, rejected Garrison's theology and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil, not a sin.[93]\n  Westward expansion and Manifest Destiny[edit]  Main article: American frontier \n The American colonies and the new nation grew rapidly in population and area, as pioneers pushed the frontier of settlement west.[94] The process finally ended around 1890–1912 as the last major farmlands and ranch lands were settled. Native American tribes in some places resisted militarily, but they were overwhelmed by settlers and the army and after 1830 were relocated to reservations in the west. The highly influential \"Frontier Thesis\" of Wisconsin historian Frederick Jackson Turner argues that the frontier shaped the national character, with its boldness, violence, innovation, individualism, and democracy.[95]\n  The California Gold Rush news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.\n \n\n Recent historians have emphasized the multicultural nature of the frontier. Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the \"Wild West\" of the second half of the 19th century. As defined by Hine and Faragher, \"frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states\". They explain, \"It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America.\"[95] The first settlers in the west were the Spanish in New Mexico; they became U.S. citizens in 1848. The Hispanics in California (\"Californios\") were overwhelmed by over 100,000 gold rush miners. California grew explosively. San Francisco by 1880 had become the economic hub of the entire Pacific Coast with a diverse population of a quarter million. \n From the early 1830s to 1869, the Oregon Trail and its many offshoots were used by over 300,000 settlers. '49ers (in the California Gold Rush), ranchers, farmers, and entrepreneurs and their families headed to California, Oregon, and other points in the far west. Wagon-trains took five or six months on foot; after 1869, the trip took 6 days by rail.[96]\n Manifest Destiny was the belief that American settlers were destined to expand across the continent. This concept was born out of \"A sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example ... generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven\".[97] Manifest Destiny was rejected by modernizers, especially the Whigs like Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln who wanted to build cities and factories – not more farms.[98]Democrats strongly favored expansion, and won the key election of 1844. After a bitter debate in Congress the Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845, leading to war with Mexico, who considered Texas to be a part of Mexico due to the large numbers of Mexican settlers.[99]\n  The American occupation of Mexico City in 1848\n \n\n The Mexican–American War (1846–48) broke out with the Whigs opposed to the war, and the Democrats supporting the war. The U.S. army, using regulars and large numbers of volunteers, defeated the Mexican armies, invaded at several points, captured Mexico City and won decisively. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the war in 1848. Many Democrats wanted to annex all of Mexico, but that idea was rejected by southerners who argued that by incorporating millions of Mexican people, mainly of mixed race, would undermine the United States as an exclusively white republic.[100] Instead the U.S. took Texas and the lightly settled northern parts (California and New Mexico). The Hispanic residents were given full citizenship and the Mexican Indians became American Indians. Simultaneously, gold was discovered in California in 1849, attracting over 100,000 men to northern California in a matter of months in the California Gold Rush. A peaceful compromise with Britain gave the U.S. ownership of the Oregon Country, which was renamed the Oregon Territory.[99]\n  Divisions between North and South[edit]  Main articles: Origins of the American Civil War and History of the United States (1849–65) \n  United States map, 1863  Union states\n  Union territories not permitting slavery\n  Border Union states, permitting slavery\n  Confederate states\n  Union territories permitting slavery (claimed by Confederacy)\n \n \n\n The central issue after 1848 was the expansion of slavery, pitting the anti-slavery elements in the North, against the pro-slavery elements that dominated the South. A small number of active Northerners were abolitionists who declared that ownership of slaves was a sin (in terms of Protestant theology) and demanded its immediate abolition. Much larger numbers in the North were against the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that America would be committed to free land (as in low-cost farms owned and cultivated by a family), free labor, and free speech (as opposed to censorship of abolitionist material in the South). Southern whites insisted that slavery was of economic, social, and cultural benefit to all whites (and even to the slaves themselves), and denounced all anti-slavery spokesmen as \"abolitionists\".[101] Justifications of slavery included economics, history, religion, legality, social good, and even humanitarianism, to further their arguments. Defenders of slavery argued that the sudden end to the slave economy would have had a profound and killing economic impact in the South where reliance on slave labor was the foundation of their economy. They also argued that if all the slaves were freed, there would be widespread unemployment and chaos.\n Religious activists split on slavery, with the Methodists and Baptists dividing into northern and southern denominations. In the North, the Methodists, Congregationalists, and Quakers included many abolitionists, especially among women activists. (The Catholic, Episcopal and Lutheran denominations largely ignored the slavery issue.)[103]\n The issue of slavery in the new territories was seemingly settled by the Compromise of 1850, brokered by Whig Henry Clay and Democrat Stephen Douglas; the Compromise included the admission of California as a free state in exchange for no federal restrictions on slavery placed on Utah or New Mexico.[104] The point of contention was the Fugitive Slave Act, which increased federal enforcement and required even free states to cooperate in turning over fugitive slaves to their owners. Abolitionists pounced on the Act to attack slavery, as in the best-selling anti-slavery novelUncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe.[105]\n The Compromise of 1820 was repealed in 1854 with the Kansas–Nebraska Act, promoted by Senator Douglas in the name of \"popular sovereignty\" and democracy. It permitted voters to decide on the legality slavery in each territory, and allowed Douglas to adopt neutrality on the issue of slavery. Anti-slavery forces rose in anger and alarm, forming the new Republican Party. Pro- and anti- contingents rushed to Kansas to vote slavery up or down, resulting in a miniature civil war called Bleeding Kansas. By the late 1850s, the young Republican Party dominated nearly all northern states and thus the electoral college. It insisted that slavery would never be allowed to expand (and thus would slowly die out).[106]\n The Southern slavery-based societies had become wealthy based on their cotton and other agricultural commodity production, and some particularly profited from the internal slave trade. Northern cities such as Boston and New York, and regional industries, were tied economically to slavery by banking, shipping, and manufacturing, including textile mills. By 1860, there were four million slaves in the South, nearly eight times as many as there were nationwide in 1790. The plantations were highly profitable, due to the heavy European demand for raw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves (largely drawn from the declining tobacco regions). \n  The United States, immediately before the Civil War. All of the lands east of, or bordering, the Mississippi River were organized as states in the Union, but the West was still largely unsettled.\n \n\n For 50 of the nation's first 72 years, a slaveholder served as President of the United States and, during that period, only slaveholding presidents were re-elected to second terms.[107] In addition, southern states benefited by their increased apportionment in Congress due to the partial counting of slaves in their populations. \n Slave rebellions, by Gabriel Prosser (1800), Denmark Vesey (1822), Nat Turner (1831), and most famously by John Brown (1859), caused fear in the white South, which imposed stricter oversight of slaves and reduced the rights of free blacks. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the Missouri Compromise. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution. \n After Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election, seven Southern states seceded from the union and set up a new nation, the Confederate States of America (Confederacy), on February 8, 1861. It attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. Army fort in South Carolina, thus igniting the war. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the Confederacy in April 1861, four more states seceded and joined the Confederacy. A few of the (northernmost) \"slave states\" did not secede and became known as the border states; these were Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri. \n During the war, the northwestern portion of Virginia seceded from the Confederacy. and became the new Union state of West Virginia.[108] West Virginia is usually associated with the border states. \n  Civil War[edit]  Main article: American Civil War \n The Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when elements of 100,000 Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation at Fort Sumter in South Carolina. In response to the attack, on April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union\", which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had their first major clash at the First Battle of Bull Run (Battle of Manassas), ending in a Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved to both the Union and Confederacy that the war would be much longer and bloodier than originally anticipated.[109]\n  Lincoln with Allan Pinkerton and Major General John Alexander McClernand at the Battle of Antietam.\n \n\n The war soon divided into two theaters: Eastern and Western. In the western theater, the Union was relatively successful, with major battles, such as Perryville and Shiloh along with Union gunboat dominance of navigable rivers producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations.[110]\n Warfare in the Eastern theater began poorly for the Union as the Confederates won at Manassas Junction (Bull Run), just outside Washington. Major General George B. McClellan was put in charge of the Union armies. After reorganizing the new Army of the Potomac, McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia in his Peninsula Campaign and retreated after attacks from newly appointed Confederate General Robert E. Lee.[111] Meanwhile, both sides concentrated in 1861–62 on raising and training new armies. The main action was Union success in controlling the border states, with Confederates largely driven out of Maryland, West Virginia (a new state), Kentucky and Missouri. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland was designed to hurt Union morale and win European support. It ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam, and Lincoln's warning he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 if the states did not return. Making slavery a central war goal Energized Republicans in the North, as well as their enemies, the anti-war Copperhead Democrats. It ended the risk of British and French intervention. \n Lee's smaller army won at the Battle of Fredericksburg late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, while losing his top aide, Stonewall Jackson. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause war-weariness in the North. In perhaps the turning point of the war, Lee's army was badly beaten at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1–3, 1863, and barely made it back to Virginia. On the homefront, industrial expansion in the North expanded dramatically, using its extensive railroad service, and moving industrial workers into munitions factories. Foreign trade increased, with the United States providing both food and cotton to Britain, And Britain sending in manufactured products and thousands of volunteers for the Union Army (plus a few to the Confederates). The British operated blockade runners bringing in food, luxury items and munitions to the Confederacy, bringing out tobacco and cotton. The Union blockade increasingly shut down Confederate ports, and by late 1864 the blockade runners Were usually captured before they could make more than handful of runs. \n  \n Modern recording of Gettysburg Address originally spoken by U.S PresidentAbraham Lincoln \n \n\n  The Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864.\n \n\n In the West, on July 4, 1863, Union forces under the command of General Ulysses S. Grant gained control of the Mississippi River at the Battle of Vicksburg, thereby splitting the Confederacy. Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant put General William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the Western armies. In 1864, Sherman marched south from Chattanooga to capture Atlanta, a decisive victory that ended war jitters among Republicans in the North who feared they might fail to reelect Lincoln in 1864. Lincoln won a landslide. The last two years of the war were bloody for both sides, With Sherman marching almost unopposed through central and eastern Georgia, then moving up through South Carolina and North Carolina, burning cities, destroying plantations, ruining railroads and bridges, but avoiding civilian casualties. Sherman demonstrated that the South lacked the long-term ability to resist a northern invasion. Much of the heartland of the Confederacy was physically destroyed, and could no longer provide desperately needed food, horses, mules, wagons, boots or munitions to its combat armies. In spring 1864 Grant, realizing that Lee was unable to replenishes casualties, while Lincoln would provide replacements for Union losses, launched a war of attrition against Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns. The first of these, the Overland Campaign forced Lee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive, the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign in which he besieged Petersburg. After a near ten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the defense of Fort Gregg allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant pursued and launched the final, Appomattox Campaign which resulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia numbering 28,000 on April 9, 1865, at Appomattox Court House. Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended with no postwar insurgency. \n The American Civil War was the world's earliest industrial war. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in World War I. It remains the deadliest war in American history, resulting in the deaths of about 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.[113] About ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40 died.[114] Its legacy includes ending slavery in the United States, restoring the Union, and strengthening the role of the federal government. \n According to historian Allan Nevins the Civil War had a major long-term impact on the United States in terms of developing its leadership potential and moving the entire nation beyond the adolescent stage: \n The fighting and its attendant demands upon industry, finance, medicine, and law also helped train a host of leaders who during the next 35 years, to 1900, made their influence powerfully felt on most of the social, economic, and cultural fronts. It broke down barriers of parochialism; it ended distrust of large-scale effort; it hardened and matured the whole people emotionally. The adolescent land of the 1850s...rose under the blows of battle to adult estate. The nation of the post-Appomattox generation, though sadly hurt (especially in the South) by war losses, and deeply scarred psychologically (especially in the North) by war hatreds and greeds, had at last the power, resolution, and self-trust of manhood.[115]   Emancipation[edit]  See also: Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War and Emancipation Proclamation \n  \n  First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln by Francis Bicknell Carpenter[116]\n\n(People in the image are clickable.)\n \n\n  \n Modern reading of President Abraham Lincoln'sEmancipation Proclamation of 1863 giving freedom to all African Americans who resided within the Confederacy but not those within the Union.\n \n\n The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves.[117] Large numbers moved into camps run by the Freedmen's Bureau, where they were given food, shelter, medical care, and arrangements for their employment were made. \n The severe dislocations of war and Reconstruction had a large negative impact on the black population, with a large amount of sickness and death.[118]\n  Reconstruction Era[edit]  Main article: Reconstruction Era \n See also: History of the United States (1865–1918) \n   Freedmen voting in New Orleans, 1867.\n \n\n Reconstruction lasted from Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 to the Compromise of 1877.[119]\n The major issues faced by Lincoln were the status of the ex-slaves (called \"Freedmen\"), the loyalty and civil rights of ex-rebels, the status of the 11 ex-Confederate states, the powers of the federal government needed to prevent a future civil war, and the question of whether Congress or the President would make the major decisions. \n The severe threats of starvation and displacement of the unemployed Freedmen were met by the first major federal relief agency, the Freedmen's Bureau, operated by the Army.\n Three \"Reconstruction Amendments\" were passed to expand civil rights for black Americans: the Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery; the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed equal rights for all and citizenship for blacks; the Fifteenth Amendment prevented race from being used to disfranchise men. \n Ex-Confederates remained in control of most Southern states for over two years, but changed when the Radical Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1866 elections. President Andrew Johnson, who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless in the face of the Radical Republican Congress; he was impeached, but the Senate's attempt to remove him from office failed by one vote. Congress enfranchised black men and temporarily stripped many ex-Confederate leaders of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen made up of Carpetbaggers (new arrivals from the North), and Scalawags (native white Southerners). They were backed by the U.S. Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites.\n  Atlanta's railyard and roundhouse in ruins shortly after the end of the Civil War\n \n\n State by state they lost power to a conservative-Democratic coalition, which gained control of the entire South by 1877. In response to Radical Reconstruction, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) emerged in 1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1870 shut down the Klan, and it disbanded. Paramilitary groups, such as the White League and Red Shirts emerged about 1874 that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting to regain white political power in states across the South during the 1870s. Rable described them as the military arm of the Democratic Party.\n Reconstruction ended after the disputed 1876 election. The Compromise of 1877 gave Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes the White House in exchange for removing all remaining federal troops in the South. The federal government withdrew its troops from the South, and Southern Democrats took control of every Southern state. From 1890 to 1908, southern states effectively disfranchised most black voters and many poor whites by making voter registration more difficult through poll taxes, literacy tests, and other arbitrary devices. They passed segregation laws and imposed second-class status on blacks in a system known as Jim Crow that lasted until the Civil Rights Movement.\n  The West and the Gilded Age[edit]  Main articles: Gilded Age and American Indian Wars § West of the Mississippi (1811–1924) \n  The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad (1869) at First Transcontinental Railroad, by Andrew J. Russell.\n \n\n The latter half of the nineteenth century was marked by the rapid development and settlement of the far West, first by wagon trains and riverboats and then aided by the completion of the transcontinental railroad. Large numbers of European immigrants (especially from Germany and Scandinavia) took up low-cost or free farms in the Prairie States. Mining for silver and copper opened up the Mountain West. The United States Army fought frequent small-scale wars with Native Americans as settlers encroached on their traditional lands. Gradually the U.S. purchased the Native American tribal lands and extinguished their claims, forcing most tribes onto subsidized reservations. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), from 1789 to 1894: \n The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians. The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must be very much higher than the given... Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate...\n  Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie led the enormous expansion of the American steel industry.\n \n\n The \"Gilded Age\" was a term that Mark Twain used to describe the period of the late 19th century with a dramatic expansion of American wealth and prosperity, underscored by the mass corruption in the government. Reforms of the Age included the Civil Service Act, which mandated a competitive examination for applicants for government jobs. Other important legislation included the Interstate Commerce Act, which ended railroads' discrimination against small shippers, and the Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlawed monopolies in business. Twain believed that this age was corrupted by such elements as land speculators, scandalous politics, and unethical business practices. Since the days of Charles A. Beard and Matthew Josephson, some historians have argued that the United States was effectively plutocratic for at least part of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.[130][131] As financiers and industrialists such as J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller began to amass vast fortunes, many U.S. observers were concerned that the nation was losing its pioneering egalitarian spirit.\n By 1890 American industrial production and per capita income exceeded those of all other world nations. In response to heavy debts and decreasing farm prices, wheat and cotton farmers joined the Populist Party.[133] An unprecedented wave of immigration from Europe served to both provide the labor for American industry and create diverse communities in previously undeveloped areas. From 1880 to 1914, peak years of immigration, more than 22 million people migrated to the United States.[134] Most were unskilled workers who quickly found jobs in mines, mills, factories. Many immigrants were craftsmen (especially from Britain and Germany) bringing human skills, and others were farmers (especially from Germany and Scandinavia) who purchased inexpensive land on the Prairies from railroads who sent agents to Europe. Poverty, growing inequality and dangerous working conditions, along with socialist and anarchist ideas diffusing from European immigrants, led to the rise of the labor movement, which often included violent strikes.[135][136]\n  \n Chapter 9, of The Jungle,a muckracking novel by Upton Sinclair, describing corruption in the Gilded Age.\n \n\n Skilled workers banded together to control their crafts and raise wages by forming labor unions in industrial areas of the Northeast. Before the 1930s few factory workers joined the unions in the labor movement. Samuel Gompers led the American Federation of Labor (1886–1924), coordinating multiple unions. Industrial growth was rapid, led by John D. Rockefeller in oil and Andrew Carnegie in steel; both became leaders of philanthropy (Gospel of Wealth), giving away their fortunes to create the modern system of hospitals, universities, libraries, and foundations. \n  Mulberry Street, along which Manhattan's Little Italy is centered. Lower East Side, circa 1900. Almost 97% of residents of the 10 largest American cities of 1900 were non-Hispanic whites.[137] \n \n\n The Panic of 1893 broke out and was a severe nationwide depression impacting farmers, workers, and businessmen who saw prices, wages, and profits fall.[138] Many railroads went bankrupt. The resultant political reaction fell on the Democratic Party, whose leader President Grover Cleveland shouldered much of the blame. Labor unrest involved numerous strikes, most notably the violent Pullman Strike of 1894, which was shut down by federal troops under Cleveland's orders. The Populist Party gained strength among cotton and wheat farmers, as well as coal miners, but was overtaken by the even more popular Free Silver movement, which demanded using silver to enlarge the money supply, leading to inflation that the silverites promised would end the depression.[139]\n The financial, railroad, and business communities fought back hard, arguing that only the gold standard would save the economy. In the most intense election in the nation's history, conservative Republican William McKinley defeated silverite William Jennings Bryan, who ran on the Democratic, Populist, and Silver Republican tickets. Bryan swept the South and West, but McKinley ran up landslides among the middle class, industrial workers, cities, and among upscale farmers in the Midwest.[140]\n Prosperity returned under McKinley, the gold standard was enacted, and the tariff was raised. By 1900 the U.S. had the strongest economy on the globe. Apart from two short recessions (in 1907 and 1920) the overall economy remained prosperous and growing until 1929. Republicans, citing McKinley's policies, took the credit.[141]\n  20th century[edit]   Progressive Era[edit]  Main article: Progressive Era \n  American children of many ethnic backgrounds celebrate noisily in a 1902 Puck cartoon.\n \n\n Dissatisfaction on the part of the growing middle class with the corruption and inefficiency of politics as usual, and the failure to deal with increasingly important urban and industrial problems, led to the dynamic Progressive Movement starting in the 1890s. In every major city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change. Leading politicians from both parties, most notably Theodore Roosevelt, Charles Evans Hughes, and Robert La Follette on the Republican side, and William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson on the Democratic side, took up the cause of progressive reform. Women became especially involved in demands for woman suffrage, prohibition, and better schools; their most prominent leader was Jane Addams of Chicago, who created settlement houses. \"Muckraking\" journalists such as Upton Sinclair, Lincoln Steffens and Jacob Riis exposed corruption in business and government along with rampant inner city poverty. Progressives implemented anti-trust laws and regulated such industries of meat-packing, drugs, and railroads. Four new constitutional amendments – the Sixteenth through Nineteenth – resulted from progressive activism, bringing the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, prohibition, and woman suffrage. The period also saw a major transformation of the banking system with the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913[143] and the arrival of cooperative banking in the US with the founding of the first credit union in 1908.[144] The Progressive Movement lasted through the 1920s; the most active period was 1900–18.[145]\n  Imperialism[edit]  Further information: American imperialism \n  This cartoon reflects the view of Judge magazine regarding America's imperial ambitions following a quick victory in the Spanish–American War of 1898.[146] The American flag flies from the Philippines and Hawaii in the Pacific to Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.\n \n\n The United States emerged as a world economic and military power after 1890. The main episode was the Spanish–American War, which began when Spain refused American demands to reform its oppressive policies in Cuba.[147] The \"splendid little war\", as one official called it, involved a series of quick American victories on land and at sea. At the Treaty of Paris peace conference the United States acquired the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam.[148]\n Cuba became an independent country, under close American tutelage. Although the war itself was widely popular, the peace terms proved controversial. William Jennings Bryan led his Democratic Party in opposition to control of the Philippines, which he denounced as imperialism unbecoming to American democracy.[148] President William McKinley defended the acquisition and was riding high as the nation had returned to prosperity and felt triumphant in the war. McKinley easily defeated Bryan in a rematch in the 1900 presidential election.[149]\n After defeating an insurrection by Filipino nationalists, the United States engaged in a large-scale program to modernize the economy of the Philippines and dramatically upgrade the public health facilities.[150] By 1908, however, Americans lost interest in an empire and turned their international attention to the Caribbean, especially the building of the Panama Canal. In 1912 when Arizona became the final mainland state, the American Frontier came to an end. The canal opened in 1914 and increased trade with Japan and the rest of the Far East. A key innovation was the Open Door Policy, whereby the imperial powers were given equal access to Chinese business, with not one of them allowed to take control of China.[151]\n  World War I[edit]  Main articles: American entry into World War I and United States home front during World War I \n  American Cemetery at Romagne-sous-Montfaucon\n \n\n As World War I raged in Europe from 1914, President Woodrow Wilson took full control of foreign policy, declaring neutrality but warning Germany that resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare against American ships supplying goods to Allied nations would mean war. Germany decided to take the risk and try to win by cutting off supplies to Britain through the sinking of ships such as the RMS Lusitania; the U.S. declared war in April 1917 mainly from the threat of the Zimmermann telegram. American money, food, and munitions arrived quickly, but troops had to be drafted and trained; by summer 1918 American soldiers under General John J. Pershing's American Expeditionary Forces arrived at the rate of 10,000 a day, while Germany was unable to replace its losses.[153] Dissent against the war was suppressed by the Sedition Act of 1918 &amp; Espionage Act of 1917, German language, leftist &amp; pacifist publications were suppressed, and over 2,000 were imprisoned for speaking out against the war, the political prisoners were later released by U.S President Warren G. Harding.[154]\n The result was Allied victory in November 1918. President Wilson demanded Germany depose the Kaiser and accept his terms in the famed Fourteen Points speech. Wilson dominated the 1919 Paris Peace Conference but Germany was treated harshly by the Allies in the Treaty of Versailles (1919) as Wilson put all his hopes in the new League of Nations. Wilson refused to compromise with Senate Republicans over the issue of Congressional power to declare war, and the Senate rejected the Treaty and the League.[155]\n  Women's suffrage[edit]  Further information: Women's suffrage in the United States \n  Women suffragists demonstrating for the right to vote in 1913.\n \n\n The women's suffrage movement began with the June 1848 National Convention of the Liberty Party. Presidential candidate Gerrit Smith argued for and established women's suffrage as a party plank. One month later, his cousin Elizabeth Cady Stanton joined with Lucretia Mott and other women to organize the Seneca Falls Convention, featuring the Declaration of Sentiments demanding equal rights for women, and the right to vote.[156] Many of these activists became politically aware during the abolitionist movement. The women's rights campaign during \"first-wave feminism\" was led by Stanton, Lucy Stone and Susan B. Anthony, among many others. Stone and Paulina Wright Davis organized the prominent and influential National Women's Rights Convention in 1850. The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the Women's Christian Temperance Union. By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights,[157] though women had made significant legal victories, gaining rights in areas such as property and child custody.[158]\n  Women's suffragists parade in New York City in 1917, carrying placards with signatures of more than a million women.[159] \n \n\n Around 1912 the feminist movement began to reawaken, putting an emphasis on its demands for equality and arguing that the corruption of American politics demanded purification by women because men could not do that job.[160] Protests became increasingly common as suffragette Alice Paul led parades through the capital and major cities. Paul split from the large National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), which favored a more moderate approach and supported the Democratic Party and Woodrow Wilson, led by Carrie Chapman Catt, and formed the more militant National Woman's Party. Suffragists were arrested during their \"Silent Sentinels\" pickets at the White House, the first time such a tactic was used, and were taken as political prisoners.[161]\n  Women surrounded by posters in English and Yiddish supporting Franklin D. Roosevelt, Herbert H. Lehman, and the American Labor Party teach other women how to vote, 1936.\n \n\n The old anti-suffragist argument that only men could fight a war, and therefore only men deserve the right to vote, was refuted by the enthusiastic participation of tens of thousands of American women on the home front in World War I. Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman Jeannette Rankin of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting. Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919, and women could vote in 1920.\n NAWSA became the League of Women Voters, and the National Woman's Party began lobbying for full equality and the Equal Rights Amendment, which would pass Congress during the second wave of the women's movement in 1972. Politicians responded to the new electorate by emphasizing issues of special interest to women, especially prohibition, child health, and world peace.[163][164] The main surge of women voting came in 1928, when the big-city machines realized they needed the support of women to elect Al Smith, a Catholic from New York City. Meanwhile, Protestants mobilized women to support Prohibition and vote for Republican Herbert Hoover.[165]\n  Roaring Twenties[edit]  Main article: History of the United States (1918–45) \n Further information: Roaring 20s and Causes of the Great Depression \n   Prohibition agents destroying barrels of alcohol in Chicago, 1921.\n \n\n In the 1920s the U.S. grew steadily in stature as an economic and military world power. The United States Senate did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles imposed by its Allies on the defeated Central Powers; instead, the United States chose to pursue unilateralism.[166] The aftershock of Russia's October Revolution resulted in real fears of Communism in the United States, leading to a Red Scare and the deportation of aliens considered subversive. \n  Money supply decreased a lot between Black Tuesday and the Bank Holiday in March 1933 when there were massive bank runs across the United States.\n \n\n While public health facilities grew rapidly in the Progressive Era, and hospitals and medical schools were modernized,[167] the nation in 1918 lost 675,000 lives to the Spanish flu pandemic.[168]\n In 1920, the manufacture, sale, import and export of alcohol were prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment, Prohibition. The result was that in cities illegal alcohol became a big business, largely controlled by racketeers. The second Ku Klux Klan grew rapidly in 1922–25, then collapsed. Immigration laws were passed to strictly limit the number of new entries. The 1920s were called the Roaring Twenties due to the great economic prosperity during this period. Jazz became popular among the younger generation, and thus the decade was also called the Jazz Age. \n The Great Depression (1929–39) and the New Deal (1933–36) were decisive moments in American political, economic, and social history that reshaped the nation.[169]\n  Great Depression and New Deal[edit]  Main articles: Great Depression in the United States and New Deal \n See also: Good Neighbor policy \n   Dorothea Lange's Migrant Mother depicts destitute pea pickers in California, centering on Florence Owens Thompson, a mother of seven, age 32, in Nipomo, California, March 1936.\n \n\n During the 1920s, the nation enjoyed widespread prosperity, albeit with a weakness in agriculture. A financial bubble was fueled by an inflated stock market, which later led to the Stock Market Crash on October 29, 1929.[170] This, along with many other economic factors, triggered a worldwide depression known as the Great Depression. During this time, the United States experienced deflation as prices fell, unemployment soared from 3% in 1929 to 25% in 1933, farm prices fell by half, and manufacturing output plunged by one-third. \n  \n President Franklin Roosevelt engaged in radio Fireside chats as means with regularly communicating with the public, this was innovative for the time. During the first visit of a sitting U.S. president to Brazil, 1936.\n \n\n  Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas (left) and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (right) in 1936\n \n\n In 1932, Democratic presidential nominee Franklin D. Roosevelt promised \"a New Deal for the American people\", coining the enduring label for his domestic policies. The result was a series of permanent reform programs including Relief for the unemployed, assistance for the elderly, jobs for young men, social security, unemployment insurance, public housing, bankruptcy insurance, farm subsidies, and regulation of financial securities. State governments added new programs as well, and introduced the sales tax to pay for them. Ideologically the revolution established modern liberalism in the United States and kept the Democrats in power in Washington almost continuously for Three decades thanks to the New Deal Coalition of ethnic Whites, Blacks, blue-collar workers, labor unions, and white Southerners. It provided relief to the long-term unemployed through numerous programs, such as the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and for young men, the Civilian Conservation Corps. Large scale spending projects designed to provide private sector construction jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the Public Works Administration. The Second New Deal was a turn to the left in 1935–36, building up labor unions through the Wagner Act. Unions became a powerful element of the merging New Deal Coalition, which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, relief recipients, big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups (especially Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North (where they could vote). Roosevelt seriously weakened his second term by a failed effort to pack the Supreme Court, which had been a center of conservative resistance to his programs. Most of the relief programs were dropped after 1938 in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the Conservative Coalition. Of special importance is the Social Security program, begun in 1935. The economy basically recovered by 1936, but had a sharp, short recession in 1937-38; long-term unemployment, however, remained a problem until it was solved by wartime spending.[171]\n In an effort to denounce past U.S. interventionism and subdue any subsequent fears of Latin Americans, Roosevelt announced on March 4, 1933, during his inaugural address, \"In the field of World policy, I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor, the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others, the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a World of neighbors.\" In order to create a friendly relationship between the United States and Central as well as South American countries, Roosevelt sought to stray from asserting military force in the region.[173] This position was affirmed by Cordell Hull, Roosevelt's Secretary of State at a conference of American states in Montevideo in December 1933. \n  World War II[edit]  Further information: World War II, Military history of the United States during World War II, and United States home front during World War II \n  The Japanese crippled American naval power with the attack on Pearl Harbor, destroying many battleships.\n \n\n In the Depression years, the United States remained focused on domestic concerns while democracy declined across the world and many countries fell under the control of dictators. Imperial Japan asserted dominance in East Asia and in the Pacific. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy militarized and threatened conquests, while Britain and France attempted appeasement to avert another war in Europe. U.S. legislation in the Neutrality Acts sought to avoid foreign conflicts; however, policy clashed with increasing anti-Nazi feelings following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 that started World War II. Roosevelt positioned the U.S. as the \"Arsenal of Democracy\", pledging full-scale financial and munitions support for the Allies – but no military personnel.[174] This was carried out through the Lend-Lease agreements. Japan tried to neutralize America's power in the Pacific by attacking Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which catalyzed American support to enter the war.[175]\n The main contributions of the U.S. to the Allied war effort comprised money, industrial output, food, petroleum, technological innovation, and (especially 1944–45), military personnel. Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked. \n  \n President Roosevelt's Infamy Speech in aftermath of Pearl Harbor Attack. Congress consequently declared war on the Empire of Japan.\n \n\n   Into the Jaws of Death: The Normandy landings began the Allied march toward Germany from the west.\n \n\n It was exhausting; leisure activities declined sharply. People tolerated the extra work because of patriotism, the pay, and the confidence that it was only \"for the duration\", and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won. Most durable goods became unavailable, and meat, clothing, and gasoline were tightly rationed. In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were controlled, and Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led to renewed growth after the war instead of a return to depression.[176][177]\n  American corpses sprawled on the beach of Tarawa, November 1943.\n \n\n The Allies – the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, China, as well as Poland, Canada and other countries – fought the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Allies saw Germany as the main threat and gave highest priority to Europe. The U.S. dominated the war against Japan and stopped Japanese expansion in the Pacific in 1942. After losing Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines to the Japanese, and drawing the Battle of the Coral Sea (May 1942), the American Navy inflicted a decisive blow at Midway (June 1942). American ground forces assisted in the North African Campaign that eventually concluded with the collapse of Mussolini's fascist government in 1943, as Italy switched to the Allied side. A more significant European front was opened on D-Day, June 6, 1944, in which American and Allied forces invaded Nazi-occupied France from Britain. \n On the home front, mobilization of the U.S. economy was managed by Roosevelt's War Production Board. The wartime production boom led to full employment, wiping out this vestige of the Great Depression. Indeed, labor shortages encouraged industry to look for new sources of workers, finding new roles for women and blacks.[178]\n  A Japanese American unfurled this banner the day after the Pearl Harbor attack. This Dorothea Lange photograph was taken in March 1942, just prior to the man's internment.\n \n\n However, the fervor also inspired anti-Japanese sentiment, leading to internment of Japanese Americans.[179] This was taken under the directive of President Roosevelt, who signed Executive Order 9066. The terms of this executive order resulted in some 120,000 people of Japanese descent living in the US removed from their homes and placed in internment camps. Two-thirds of those interned were American citizens and half of them were children. Those who were as little as 1/16 Japanese[180] and orphaned infants with \"one drop of Japanese blood\" were placed in internment camps.[181] The US Supreme Court held the Japanese American internment camps to be constitutional in a 6–3 decision in Korematsu v. United StatesSupreme Court case.\n  The Trinity test of the Manhattan Project was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, which lead Oppenheimer to recall verses from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita, notably being: \"I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds\".\n \n\n Research and development took flight as well, best seen in the Manhattan Project, a secret effort to harness nuclear fission to produce highly destructive atomic bombs.[183] From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major GeneralLeslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs. The first nuclear device ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb at the Trinity test, conducted at New Mexico's Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range on 16 July 1945.[184]\n  \n Excerpt of U.S PresidentHarry Truman's speech regarding the nuclear attack on Hiroshima, Japan.Captions provided\n \n\n Though the nation lost more than 400,000 military personnel,[190] the mainland prospered untouched by the devastation of war that inflicted a heavy toll on Europe and Asia. \n Participation in postwar foreign affairs marked the end of predominant American isolationism. The awesome threat of nuclear weapons inspired both optimism and fear. Nuclear weapons were never used after 1945, as both sides drew back from the brink and a \"long peace\" characterized the Cold War years, starting with the TrumanDoctrine on May 22, 1947. There were, however, regional wars in Korea and Vietnam.[191]\n  The Cold War[edit]  Main articles: History of the United States (1945–64), History of the United States (1964–80), and United States in the 1950s \n Following World War II, the United States emerged as one of the two dominant superpowers, the USSR being the other. The U.S. Senate on a bipartisan vote approved U.S. participation in the United Nations (UN), which marked a turn away from the traditional isolationism of the U.S. and toward increased international involvement. \n The primary American goal of 1945–48 was to rescue Europe from the devastation of World War II and to contain the expansion of Communism, represented by the Soviet Union. U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War was built around the support of Western Europe and Japan along with the policy of containment, stopping the spread of communism. The U.S. joined the wars in Korea and Vietnam and toppled left-wing governments in the third world to try to stop its spread. The Truman Doctrine of 1947 provided military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey to counteract the threat of Communist expansion in the Balkans. In 1948, the United States replaced piecemeal financial aid programs with a comprehensive Marshall Plan, which pumped money into the economy of Western Europe, and removed trade barriers, while modernizing the managerial practices of businesses and governments.[193]\n The Plan's $13 billion budget was in the context of a U.S. GDP of $258 billion in 1948 and was in addition to the $12 billion in American aid given to Europe between the end of the war and the start of the Marshall Plan. Soviet head of state Joseph Stalin prevented his satellite states from participating, and from that point on, Eastern Europe, with inefficient centralized economies, fell further and further behind Western Europe in terms of economic development and prosperity. In 1949, the United States, rejecting the long-standing policy of no military alliances in peacetime, formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance, which continues into the 21st century. In response the Soviets formed the Warsaw Pact of communist states, leading to the \"iron curtain\".[193] In August 1949 the Soviets tested their first nuclear weapon, thereby escalating the risk of warfare. The threat of mutually assured destruction however, prevented both powers from nuclear war, and resulted in proxy wars, especially in Korea and Vietnam, in which the two sides did not directly confront each other.[191]\n  Eisenhower button from the 1952 campaign\n \n\n President Dwight D Eisenhower, elected in a landslide as the first Republican president since 1932, had a lasting impact on American life and politics.[194] He ended the Korean War, and avoided any other major conflict. He cut military spending by reliance on very high technology, such as nuclear weapons carried by long-range bombers and intercontinental missiles. He gave strong support to the NATO alliance, and built other alliances along similar lines, but they never were especially effective. After Stalin died in 1953 he worked to obtain friendlier relationships with the Soviet Union. At home he ended McCarthyism, expanded the Social Security program and presided over a decade of bipartisan comity. He promoted civil rights cautiously, and sent in the Army when trouble threatened over racial integration in Little Rock Arkansas.[195] The unexpected leapfrogging of American technology by the Soviets in 1957 with Sputnik, the first Earth satellite, began the Space Race, won in 1969 by the Americans as Apollo 11 landed astronauts on the Moon. The angst about the weaknesses of American education led to large-scale federal support for science education and research.[196] In the decades after World War II, the United States became a global influence in economic, political, military, cultural, and technological affairs. \n  \n President John F Kennedy Address on the Cuban Missile Crisis \n \n\n   President Kennedy's Civil Rights Address, June 11, 1963.\n \n\n In 1960, the charismatic John F. Kennedy was elected as the first and – thus far – only Roman Catholic President. The Kennedy clan brought a new life and vigor to the atmosphere of the White House. His time in office was marked by such notable events as the acceleration of the United States' role in the Space Race, escalation of the American role in the Vietnam War, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the jailing of Martin Luther King, Jr. during the Birmingham campaign. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, leaving the nation in profound shock.[197]\n  Climax of liberalism[edit]   American soldiers during the Vietnam War, 1967\n \n\n The climax of liberalism came in the mid-1960s with the success of President Lyndon B. Johnson (1963–1969) in securing congressional passage of his Great Society programs.[198] They included civil rights, the end of legal segregation, Medicare, extension of welfare, federal aid to education at all levels, subsidies for the arts and humanities, environmental activism, and a series of programs designed to wipe out poverty.[199] As recent historians have explained: \n Gradually, liberal intellectuals crafted a new vision for achieving economic and social justice. The liberalism of the early 1960s contained no hint of radicalism, little disposition to revive new deal era crusades against concentrated economic power, and no intention to redistribute wealth or restructure existing institutions. Internationally it was strongly anti-Communist. It aimed to defend the free world, to encourage economic growth at home, and to ensure that the resulting plenty was fairly distributed. Their agenda-much influenced by Keynesian economic theory-envisioned massive public expenditure that would speed economic growth, thus providing the public resources to fund larger welfare, housing, health, and educational programs.\n  \n Sound of Apollo 11 and its landing on the Moon \n \n\n  Apollo 11\n \n\n Johnson was rewarded with an electoral landslide in 1964 against conservative Barry Goldwater, which broke the decades-long control of Congress by the Conservative Coalition. However, the Republicans bounced back in 1966 and elected Richard Nixon in 1968. Nixon largely continued the New Deal and Great Society programs he inherited; conservative reaction would come with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. Meanwhile, the American people completed a great migration from farms into the cities and experienced a period of sustained economic expansion. \n  Counterculture, and civil rights[edit]   Civil Rights Movement[edit]  Main article: Civil Rights Movement \n  Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. (right), with President Lyndon B. Johnson in the background (left)\n \n\n Starting in the late 1950s, institutionalized racism across the United States, but especially in the South, was increasingly challenged by the growing Civil Rights Movement. The activism of African-American leaders Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr. led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which launched the movement. For years African Americans would struggle with violence against them but would achieve great steps toward equality with Supreme Court decisions, including Brown v. Board of Education and Loving v. Virginia, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which ended the Jim Crow laws that legalized racial segregation between whites and blacks.\n  \n President Lyndon Johnson's speech on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n \n\n  Duncan West speaking with Cesar Chavez. The Delano UFW rally. Duncan represented the Teamsters who were supporting the UFW and condemning their IBT leadership for working as thugs against a fellow union. Duncan and his wife Mary were the branch organizers of the LA IS.\n \n\n Martin Luther King, Jr., who had won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to achieve equality of the races, was assassinated in 1968. Following his death others led the movement, most notably King's widow, Coretta Scott King, who was also active, like her husband, in the Opposition to the Vietnam War, and in the Women's Liberation Movement. There were 164 riots in 128 American cities in the first nine months of 1967. Frustrations with the seemingly slow progress of the integration movement led to the emergence of more radical discourses during the early 1960s, which, in turn, gave rise to the Black Power movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The decade would ultimately bring about positive strides toward integration, especially in government service, sports, and entertainment. Native Americans turned to the federal courts to fight for their land rights. They held protests highlighting the federal government's failure to honor treaties. One of the most outspoken Native American groups was the American Indian Movement (AIM). In the 1960s, Cesar Chavez began organizing poorly paid Mexican-American farm workers in California. He led a five-year-long strike by grape pickers. Then Chávez formed the nation's first successful union of farm workers. His United Farm Workers of America (UFW) faltered after a few years but after Chavez died in 1993 he became an iconic \"folk saint\" in the pantheon of Mexican Americans.\n  The Women's Movement[edit]  Further information: Second-wave feminism \n  Anti-Vietnam War demonstration, 1967\n \n\n A new consciousness of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan's best-seller, The Feminine Mystique, which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation of the notion that women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In 1966 Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women, or NOW, to act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans.[158]\n  Two hippies at Woodstock \n \n\n Protests began, and the new Women's Liberation Movement grew in size and power, gained much media attention, and, by 1968, had replaced the Civil Rights Movement as the U.S's main social revolution. Marches, parades, rallies, boycotts, and pickets brought out thousands, sometimes millions. There were striking gains for women in medicine, law, and business, while only a few were elected to office. The Movement was split into factions by political ideology early on, however (with NOW on the left, the Women's Equity Action League (WEAL) on the right, the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC) in the center, and more radical groups formed by younger women on the far left). The proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, passed by Congress in 1972 was defeated by a conservative coalition mobilized by Phyllis Schlafly. They argued that it degraded the position of the housewife and made young women susceptible to the military draft.\n However, many federal laws (i.e., those equalizing pay, employment, education, employment opportunities, and credit; ending pregnancy discrimination; and requiring NASA, the Military Academies, and other organizations to admit women), state laws (i.e., those ending spousal abuse and marital rape), Supreme Court rulings (i.e. ruling that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied to women), and state ERAs established women's equal status under the law, and social custom and consciousness began to change, accepting women's equality. The controversial issue of abortion, deemed by the Supreme Court as a fundamental right in Roe v. Wade (1973), is still a point of debate today.\n  The Counterculture Revolution and Cold War Détente[edit]  Main article: History of the United States (1964–80) \n  United States Navy F-4 Phantom II shadows a Soviet Tu-95 Bear D aircraft in the early 1970s\n \n\n  U.S. Senator Edmund Muskie speaking at Fairmount Park, Philadelphia on Earth Day, 1970\n \n\n Amid the Cold War, the United States entered the Vietnam War, whose growing unpopularity fed already existing social movements, including those among women, minorities, and young people. President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society social programs and numerous rulings by the Warren Court added to the wide range of social reform during the 1960s and 1970s. Feminism and the environmental movement became political forces, and progress continued toward civil rights for all Americans. The Counterculture Revolution swept through the nation and much of the western world in the late sixties and early seventies, further dividing Americans in a \"culture war\" but also bringing forth more liberated social views.\n Johnson was succeeded in 1969 by Republican Richard Nixon, who attempted to gradually turn the war over to the South Vietnamese forces. He negotiated the peace treaty in 1973 which secured the release of POWs and led to the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The war had cost the lives of 58,000 American troops. Nixon manipulated the fierce distrust between the Soviet Union and China to the advantage of the United States, achieving détente (relaxation; ease of tension) with both parties.\n  Nixon departs\n \n\n The Watergate scandal, involving Nixon's cover-up of his operatives' break-in into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex destroyed his political base, sent many aides to prison, and forced Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974. He was succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford. The Fall of Saigon ended the Vietnam War and resulted in North and South Vietnam being reunited. Communist victories in neighboring Cambodia and Laos occurred in the same year.\n The OPEC oil embargo marked a long-term economic transition since, for the first time, energy prices skyrocketed, and American factories faced serious competition from foreign automobiles, clothing, electronics, and consumer goods. By the late 1970s the economy suffered an energy crisis, slow economic growth, high unemployment, and very high inflation coupled with high interest rates (the term stagflation was coined). Since economists agreed on the wisdom of deregulation, many of the New Deal era regulations were ended, such as in transportation, banking, and telecommunications.\n Jimmy Carter, running as someone who was not a part of the Washington political establishment, was elected president in 1976. On the world stage, Carter brokered the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt. In 1979, Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 66 Americans hostage, resulting in the Iran hostage crisis. With the hostage crisis and continuing stagflation, Carter lost the 1980 election to the Republican Ronald Reagan. On January 20, 1981, minutes after Carter's term in office ended, the remaining U.S. captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the 444-day hostage crisis.\n  Close of the 20th century[edit]  Main article: History of the United States (1980–91) \n   Ronald Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate challenges Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall in 1987, shortly before the end of the Cold War.\n \n\n  \n  President Regan's Bradenburg Gate speech, famous for the phrase 'Tear down this wall'\n \n\n Ronald Reagan produced a major realignment with his 1980 and 1984 landslide elections. Reagan's economic policies (dubbed \"Reaganomics\") and the implementation of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 28% over the course of seven years. Reagan continued to downsize government taxation and regulation. The U.S. experienced a recession in 1982, but the negative indicators reversed, with the inflation rate decreasing from 11% to 2%, the unemployment rate decreasing from 10.8% in December 1982 to 7.5% in November 1984, and the economic growth rate increasing from 4.5% to 7.2%.\n Reagan ordered a buildup of the U.S. military, incurring additional budget deficits. Reagan introduced a complicated missile defense system known as the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) (dubbed \"Star Wars\" by opponents) in which, theoretically, the U.S. could shoot down missiles with laser systems in space. The Soviets reacted harshly because they thought it violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and would upset the balance of power by giving the U.S. a major military advantage. For years Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev argued vehemently against SDI. However, by the late 1980s he decided the system would never work and should not be used to block disarmament deals with the U.S. Historians argue how great an impact the SDI threat had on the Soviets – whether it was enough to force Gorbachev to initiate radical reforms, or whether the deterioration of the Soviet economy alone forced the reforms. There is agreement that the Soviets realized they were well behind the Americans in military technology, that to try to catch up would be very expensive, and that the military expenses were already a very heavy burden slowing down their economy.\n Reagan's Invasion of Grenada and bombing of Libya were popular in the U.S, though his backing of the Contras rebels was mired in the controversy over the Iran–Contra affair that revealed Reagan's poor management style.\n  Supreme Court Justice-nominee Sandra Day O'Connor talks with President Ronald Reagan outside the White House, July 15, 1981. Serving from her appointment in 1981 by Ronald Reagan until her retirement in 2006. She was the first woman to serve as a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n \n\n Reagan met four times with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who ascended to power in 1985, and their summit conferences led to the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Gorbachev tried to save Communism in the Soviet Union first by ending the expensive arms race with America, then by shedding the East European empire in 1989. The Soviet Union collapsed on Christmas Day 1991, ending the U.S–Soviet Cold War. \n  Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty\n \n\n The United States emerged as the world's sole remaining superpower and continued to intervene in international affairs during the 1990s, including the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq. Following his election in 1992, President Bill Clinton oversaw one of the longest periods of economic expansion and unprecedented gains in securities values, a side effect of the digital revolution and new business opportunities created by the Internet. He also worked with the Republican Congress to pass the first balanced federal budget in 30 years.\n In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of lying about a sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. He was acquitted by the Senate. The failure of impeachment and the Democratic gains in the 1998 election forced House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, to resign from Congress.\n  Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat during the Oslo Accords on September 13, 1993.\n \n\n The Republican Party expanded its base throughout the South after 1968 (excepting 1976), largely due to its strength among socially conservative white Evangelical Protestants and traditionalist Roman Catholics, added to its traditional strength in the business community and suburbs. As white Democrats in the South lost dominance of the Democratic Party in the 1990s, the region took on the two-party apparatus which characterized most of the nation. The Republican Party's central leader by 1980 was Ronald Reagan, whose conservative policies called for reduced government spending and regulation, lower taxes, and a strong anti-Soviet foreign policy. His iconic status in the party persists into the 21st century, as practically all Republican Party leaders acknowledge his stature. Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue, \"The Republican party, nationally, moved from right-center toward the center in 1940s and 1950s, then moved right again in the 1970s and 1980s.\" They add: \"The Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s.\"\n The presidential election in 2000 between George W. Bush and Al Gore was one of the closest in U.S. history and helped lay the seeds for political polarization to come. The vote in the decisive state of Florida was extremely close and produced a dramatic dispute over the counting of votes. The U.S. Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore ended the recount with a 5–4 vote. That meant Bush, then in the lead, carried Florida and the election. Including 2000, the Democrats outpolled the Republicans in the national vote in every election from 1992 to 2016, except for 2004. \n  21st century[edit]   9/11 and the War on Terror[edit]  Main article: History of the United States (1991–2008) \n Further information: September 11 attacks and War on Terror \n  The NASDAQ Composite index swelled with the dot-com bubble in the optimistic \"New Economy\". The bubble burst in 2000.\n \n\n On September 11, 2001 (\"9/11\"), the United States was struck by a terrorist attack when 19 al-Qaeda hijackers commandeered four airliners to be used in suicide attacks and intentionally crashed two into both twin towers of the World Trade Center and the third into the Pentagon, killing 2,937 victims—206 aboard the three airliners, 2,606 who were in the World Trade Center and on the ground, and 125 who were in the Pentagon. The fourth plane was re-taken by the passengers and crew of the aircraft. While they were not able to land the plane safely, they were able to re-take control of the aircraft and crash it into an empty field in Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people including the four terrorists on board, thereby saving whatever target the terrorists were aiming for. Within two hours, both Twin Towers of the World Trade Center completely collapsed causing massive damage to the surrounding area and blanketing Lower Manhattan in toxic dust clouds. All in all, a total of 2,977 victims perished in the attacks. In response, President George W. Bush on September 20 announced a \"War on Terror\". On October 7, 2001, the United States and NATO then invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime, which had provided safe haven to al-Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden.\n  \n  President Bush's address in reaction to the 9/11 attacks \n \n\n   \n The former World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan during September 11 attacks in 2001\n \n  \n  One World Trade Center, built in its place\n \n \n\n\n The federal government established new domestic efforts to prevent future attacks. The controversial USA PATRIOT Act increased the government's power to monitor communications and removed legal restrictions on information sharing between federal law enforcement and intelligence services. A cabinet-level agency called the Department of Homeland Security was created to lead and coordinate federal counter-terrorism activities. Some of these anti-terrorism efforts, particularly the U.S. government's handling of detainees at the prison at Guantanamo Bay, led to allegations against the U.S. government of human rights violations.\n   George W. Bush addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 12, 2002 to outline the complaints of the United States government against the Iraqi government.\n \n\n In 2003, from March 19 to May 1, the United States launched an invasion of Iraq, which led to the collapse of the Iraq government and the eventual capture of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, with whom the U.S. had long-standing tense relations. The reasons for the invasion cited by the Bush administration included the spreading of democracy, the elimination of weapons of mass destruction (a key demand of the UN as well, though later investigations found parts of the intelligence reports to be inaccurate), and the liberation of the Iraqi people. Despite some initial successes early in the invasion, the continued Iraq War fueled international protests and gradually saw domestic support decline as many people began to question whether or not the invasion was worth the cost. In 2007, after years of violence by the Iraqi insurgency, President Bush deployed more troops in a strategy dubbed \"the surge\". While the death toll decreased, the political stability of Iraq remained in doubt.\n  Headquarters of the Lehman Brothers, who filed for bankruptcy in September 2008 at the height of the U.S. financial crisis.\n \n\n In 2008, the unpopularity of President Bush and the Iraq war, along with the 2008 financial crisis, led to the election of Barack Obama, the first African-American President of the United States. After his election, Obama reluctantly continued the war effort in Iraq until August 31, 2010, when he declared that combat operations had ended. However, 50,000 American soldiers and military personnel were kept in Iraq to assist Iraqi forces, help protect withdrawing forces, and work on counter-terrorism until December 15, 2011, when the war was declared formally over and the last troops left the country. At the same time, Obama increased American involvement in Afghanistan, starting a surge strategy using an additional 30,000 troops, while proposing to begin withdrawing troops sometime in December 2014. With regards to Guantanamo Bay, President Obama forbade torture but in general retained Bush's policy regarding the Guantanamo detainees, while also proposing that the prison eventually be closed.\n In May 2011, after nearly a decade in hiding, the founder and leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was killed in Pakistan in a raid conducted by U.S. naval special forces acting under President Obama's direct orders. While Al Qaeda was near collapse in Afghanistan, affiliated organizations continued to operate in Yemen and other remote areas as the CIA used drones to hunt down and remove its leadership.\n The Boston Marathon Bombing was a bombing incident, followed by subsequent related shootings, that occurred when two pressure cooker bombs exploded during the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. The bombs exploded about 12 seconds and 210 yards (190 m) apart at 2:49 pm EDT, near the marathon's finish line on Boylston Street. They killed 3 people and injured an estimated 264 others. \n The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – formerly known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq – rose to prominence in September 2014. In addition to taking control of much of Western Iraq and Eastern Syria, ISIS also beheaded three journalists, two American and one British. These events lead to a major military offensive by the United States and its allies in the region. \n On December 28, 2014, President Obama officially ended the combat mission in Afghanistan and promised a withdrawal of all remaining U.S. troops at the end of 2016 with the exception of the embassy guards.\n  The Great Recession[edit]  Main article: Great Recession \n  Congressional leadership meeting with then-President Obama in 2011.\n \n\n In September 2008, the United States, and most of Europe, entered the longest post–World War II recession, often called the \"Great Recession\". Multiple overlapping crises were involved, especially the housing market crisis, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, an automotive industry crisis, rising unemployment, and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The financial crisis threatened the stability of the entire economy in September 2008 when Lehman Brothers failed and other giant banks were in grave danger. Starting in October the federal government lent $245 billion to financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program which was passed by bipartisan majorities and signed by Bush.\n Following his election victory by a wide electoral margin in November 2008, Bush's successor – Barack Obama – signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was a $787 billion economic stimulus aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening recession. Obama, like Bush, took steps to rescue the auto industry and prevent future economic meltdowns. These included a bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, putting ownership temporarily in the hands of the government, and the \"cash for clunkers\" program which temporarily boosted new car sales.\n  \n First African American President Barack Obama's inauguration speech, January 2009\n \n\n The recession officially ended in June 2009, and the economy slowly began to expand once again. The unemployment rate peaked at 10.1% in October 2009 after surging from 4.7% in November 2007, and returned to 5.0% as of October 2015. However, overall economic growth has remained weaker in the 2010s compared to expansions in previous decades.\n  Recent events[edit]  Main article: History of the United States (2008–present) \n See also: China–United States trade war \n  Tea Party protesters walk towards the United States Capitol during the Taxpayer March on Washington, September 12, 2009.\n \n\n From 2009 to 2010, the 111th Congress passed major legislation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, informally known as Obamacare, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which were signed into law by President Obama. Following the 2010 midterm elections, which resulted in a Republican-controlled House of Representatives and a Democratic-controlled Senate, Congress presided over a period of elevated gridlock and heated debates over whether or not to raise the debt ceiling, extend tax cuts for citizens making over $250,000 annually, and many other key issues. These ongoing debates led to President Obama signing the Budget Control Act of 2011. In the Fall of 2012, Mitt Romney challenged Barack Obama for the Presidency. Following Obama's reelection in November 2012, Congress passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 – which resulted in an increase in taxes primarily on those earning the most money. Congressional gridlock continued as Congressional Republicans' call for the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – popularly known as \"Obamacare\" – along with other various demands, resulted in the first government shutdown since the Clinton administration and almost led to the first default on U.S. debt since the 19th century. As a result of growing public frustration with both parties in Congress since the beginning of the decade, Congressional approval ratings fell to record lows, with only 11% of Americans approving as of October 2013.\n Other major events that have occurred during the 2010s include the rise of new political movements, such as the conservativeTea Party movement and the liberalOccupy movement. There was also unusually severe weather during the early part of the decade. In 2012, over half the country experienced record drought and Hurricane Sandy caused massive damage to coastal areas of New York and New Jersey. \n  On the morning of June 26, 2015 outside the Supreme Court, the crowd reacts to the Court's decision on Obergefell v. Hodges \n \n\n The debate over the issue of rights for the LGBT community, most notably that of same-sex marriage, began to shift in favor of same-sex couples, and has been reflected in dozens of polls released in the early part of the decade. In 2012, President Obama became the first president to openly support same-sex marriage, and the 2013 Supreme Court decision in the case of United States v. Windsor provided for federal recognition of same-sex unions. In June 2015, the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationally in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges. \n Political debate has continued over issues such as tax reform, immigration reform, income inequality and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly with regards to global terrorism, the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and an accompanying climate of Islamophobia.\n  Trump signing Executive Order 13769 at the Pentagon as the Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Defense James Mattis look on, January 27, 2017\n \n\n On November 8, 2016, Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to become the President-elect of the United States. Trump's election became mired in controversy after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that associates of the Russian government interfered in the election \"to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process\". This, along with questions about potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, led to the launch of investigations into the matter by the FBI, and the Senate and the House Intelligence Committees.\n  Historical graph of political party control of the Senate and House of Representatives as well as the Presidency \n \n\n\n . \n  See also[edit]  \n \n  References[edit]    ^CS1 maint: Multiple names: authors list (link) \n  ^\"New Ideas About Human Migration From Asia To Americas\".

Though high by industrialized country standards, this is below the world average annual rate of 1.1%.[4] The total fertility rate in the United States estimated for 2018 is 1.73 children per woman,[5][6] which is below the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2.1. \n The American population almost quadrupled during the 20th century—at a growth rate of about 1.3% a year—from about 76 million in 1900 to 281 million in 2000. It is estimated to have reached the 200 million mark in 1967, and the 300 million mark on October 17, 2006.[7][8] Population growth is fastest among minorities as a whole, and according to the Census Bureau's estimation for 2012, 50.4% of American children under the age of 1 belonged to racial and ethnic minority groups.[9]\n White people constitute the majority of the U.S. population, with a total of about 245,532,000 or 77.7% of the population as of 2013. Non-Hispanic whites make up 62.6% of the country's population. The non-Hispanic white population of the US is expected to fall below 50% by 2045.[10]\n Hispanic and Latino Americans accounted for 48% of the national population growth of 2.9 million between July 1, 2005, and July 1, 2006.[11] Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead.\n The Census Bureau projects a U.S. population of 417 million in 2060, a 38% increase from 2007 (301.3 million),[13] and the United Nations estimates the U.S. population will be 402 million in 2050, an increase of 32% from 2007.[14] In an official census report, it was reported that 54.4% (2,150,926 out of 3,953,593) of births in 2010 were non-Hispanic white. This represents an increase of 0.3% compared to the previous year, which was 54.1%.[15]\n Contents\n\n  Population[edit]  As of November 8, 2018, the United States is estimated to have a population of 328,953,020. \n The following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook estimated as of 2018, unless otherwise indicated. \n  Structure[edit]   A population pyramid that shows the age of the population by sex in 2017.\n \n\n The median age of the total population is 38.1 years; the male median age is 36.8 years; the female median age is 39.4 years. \n The population is distributed by age as follows: \n Sex ratios: \n  Birth rate[edit]   Death rate[edit]   Total fertility rate[edit]   Mother's mean age at first birth[edit]   Life expectancy[edit]   Density[edit]  See also: List of U.S. states by population density and List of United States cities by population density \n The most densely populated state is New Jersey (1,121/mi2 or 433/km2). \n The population is highly urbanized, with 82.3% of the population residing in cities and suburbs. Large urban clusters are spread throughout the eastern half of the United States (particularly the Great Lakes area, northeast, east, and southeast) and the western tier states; mountainous areas, principally the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian chain, deserts in the southwest, the dense boreal forests in the extreme north, and the central prairie states are less densely populated; Alaska's population is concentrated along its southern coast – with particular emphasis on the city of Anchorage – and Hawaii's is centered on the island of Oahu.California and Texas are the most populous states, as the mean center of U.S. population has consistently shifted westward and southward.[16][17]New York City is the most populous city in the United States.[18]\n  Growth[edit]   Immigration and emigration[edit]  Main article: Immigration to the United States \n 13% of the population was foreign-born in 2009 – a rise of 350% since 1970 when foreign-born people accounted for 3.7% of the population,[19] including 11.2 million illegal immigrants, 80% of whom come from Latin America. Latin America is the largest region-of-birth group, accounting for over half (53%) of all foreign born population in US, and thus is also the largest source of both legal and illegal immigration to US. In 2011, there are 18.1 million naturalized citizens in the United States, accounting for 45% of the foreign-born population (40.4 million) and 6% of the total US population at the time, and around 680,000 legal immigrants are naturalized annually.\n Foreign-born immigration has caused the U.S. population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign-born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 45 million in 2015, representing one-third of the population increase. In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants (second-generation Americans) in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population.\n 3.9 migrant(s)/1,000 population, estimated in 2017.

census numbers do not\n include American Indian natives before 1860.  In 1900, when the U.S. population was 76 million, there were 66.8 million Whites in the United States, representing 88% of the total population,[46] 8.8 million Black Americans, with about 90% of them still living in Southern states,[47] and slightly more than 500,000 Hispanics.[48]\n Under the law, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965,[49] the number of first-generation immigrants living in the United States has increased,[50] from 9.6 million in 1970 to about 38 million in 2007.[51] Around a million people legally immigrated to the United States per year in the 1990s, up from 250,000 per year in the 1950s. In 2009, 37% of immigrants originated in Asia, 42% in North America, and 11% in Africa.[53]\n In 1900, non-Hispanic whites comprised almost 97% of the population of the 10 largest American cities.[54] The Census Bureau reported that minorities (including Hispanic whites) made up 50.4% of the children born in the U.S. between July 2010 and July 2011,[55] compared to 37% in 1990.[56]\n In 2010, the state with the lowest fertility rate was Rhode Island, with a rate of 1.63, while Utah had the greatest rate with a rate of 2.45.[15] This correlates with the ages of the states' populations: Rhode Island has the ninth-oldest median age in the US—39.2—while Utah has the youngest—29.0.[57]\n In 2017, the U.S. birth rate remains well below the replacement level needed – at least 2.1 children per woman so as not to experience population decreases – as White American births fell in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Among non-Hispanic white women, no states had a fertility rate above the replacement level. Among non-Hispanic black women, 12 states reached above the replacement level needed. Among Hispanic women, 29 states did.[58] For non-Hispanic white women, the highest total fertility rate was in Utah, at 2.099, and the lowest in the District of Columbia, at 1.012. Among non-Hispanic black women, the highest total fertility rate was in Maine, at 4.003, and the lowest in Wyoming, at 1.146. For Hispanic women, the highest total fertility rate was in Alabama, at 3.085, and the lowest in Vermont, at 1.200, and Maine, at 1.281.[58][59] Due to the aging and low birth rates among white people, deaths now outnumber births among white people in more than half the states in the country.[60]\n In 2018, U.S. births fell to the lowest level in 32 years.[61]\n  Median age of the population[edit]  Median age of the U.S. population through history.

Since the 2000 census, Congress has authorized people to identify themselves according to more than one racial classification by selecting more than one category. Only one ethnicity may be selected, however, because the U.S. Census recognizes only two ethnicities—Hispanic and Non-Hispanic—which are mutually exclusive since you can be one or the other, but not both. The Census Bureau defines \"Hispanic\" as any person who has an ancestral connection to Latin America. \n According to the 2013–2017 American Community Survey, the racial composition of the United States in 2017 was:[74]\n   Race Population (2017 est.)

There are 573 federally recognized tribal governments[80] in the United States. As of 2000, the largest groups in the United States by population were Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, Sioux, Chippewa, Apache, Blackfeet, Iroquois, and Pueblo. \n  Other groups[edit]  There were 22.1 million veterans in 2009,[81] meaning that less than 10% of Americans served in the Armed Forces.\n In 2010, The Washington Post estimated that there were 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country.[83]\n There were about 2 million people in prison in 2010.[84]\n The 2000 U.S. Census counted same-sex couples in an oblique way; asking the sex and the relationship to the \"main householder\", whose sex was also asked. Community Marketing &amp; Insights, an organization specializing in analyzing gay demographic data, reported, based on this count in the 2000 census and in the 2000 supplementary survey, that same-sex couples comprised between 0.99% and 1.13% of U.S. couples in 2000.[85] A 2006 report issued by The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation concluded that the number of same-sex couples in the U.S. grew from 2000 to 2005, from nearly 600,000 couples in 2000 to almost 777,000 in 2005.[citation needed] A 2006 UCLA study reported that 4.1% of Americans aged 18–45 identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.[86]\n A 2011 report by the Williams Institute estimated that 9 million adults identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, representing 3.5% of the population over 18.[87][citation needed] A spokesperson said that, until recently, few studies have tried to eliminate people who had occasionally undertaken homosexual behavior or entertained homosexual thoughts, from people who identified as lesbian or gay.[88] (Older estimates have varied depending on methodology and timing; see Demographics of sexual orientation for a list of studies.) The American Community Survey from the 2000 U.S. Census estimated 776,943 same-sex couple households in the country as a whole, representing about 0.5% of the population.[86]\n  Projections[edit]   U.S. Census Population projections (2012)[89]    2015 2050     White Americans1  77.4% 70.8%    &gt; Non-Hispanic Whites  61.8% 46.6%    Black Americans1  13.2% 14.4%     Asian Americans1  5.3% 7.7%     Multiracial Americans1  2.6% 5.4%     Hispanics/Latinos (of any race) 17.8% 28.0%   1Including Hispanics    A report by the U.S. Census Bureau projects a decrease in the ratio of Whites between 2010 and 2050, from 79.5% to 74.0%.[90] At the same time, Non-Hispanic Whites are projected to no longer make up a majority of the population by 2045, but will remain the largest single ethnic group. In 2050 they will compose 46.3% of the population. Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.[91]\n The report foresees the Hispanic or Latino population rising from 16% today to 30% by 2050, the Black percentage barely rising from 12.9% to 13.1%, and Asian Americans upping their 4.6% share to 7.8%. The United States had a population of 310 million people in October 2010, and is projected to reach 400 million by 2039 and 439 million in 2050.[13][93][94] It is further projected that 82% of the increase in population from 2005 to 2050 will be due to immigrants and their children.[95]\n Of the nation's children in 2050, 62% are expected to be of a minority ethnicity, up from 44% today. Approximately 39% are projected to be Hispanic or Latino (up from 22% in 2008), and 38% are projected to be single-race, non-Hispanic Whites (down from 56% in 2008).[96] Racial and ethnic minorities surpassed non-Hispanic whites as the largest group of American children under 5 years old in 2015.[97]\n Pew Research Center projections   Pew Research Center projections (2008)[98]    1960 2005 2050    White Americans 85% 67% 47%    Hispanic Americans 3.5% 14% 29%    Black Americans 11% 13% 13%    Asian Americans 0.6% 5% 9%   Note: All races modified and not Hispanic; American Indian/Alaska Native not shown.    The United Nations projects a population of just over 400 million in 2060.[99]\n The country's racial profile will be vastly different, and although whites will remain the single largest racial group in the US, they will no longer be a majority by 2055 according to Pew Research Center. Growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations is predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years. By 2055, the breakdown is estimated to be 48% White, 24% Hispanic, 14% Asian, and 13% Black.[99]\n As of 2015, 14% of the United States' population is foreign born, compared to just 5% in 1965. Nearly 39 million immigrants have come to the US since 1965, with most coming from Asia and Latin America. The 2015 Census Report predicts that the percentage of the US population that is foreign born will continue to increase, reaching 19% by 2060. This increase in the foreign-born population will account for a large share of the overall population growth.[99]\n The average US citizen of 2060 is likely to be older than the average citizen of today, and almost one in four people will be 65 or older.[99]\n  U.S. Census Census Bureau projections[edit]  Percent minority 1970–2042 (2008 projections) Note: “Minority” refers to people who reported their ethnicity and race as something other than non-Hispanic White alone in the decennial census. \n Source: U.S. Census Bureau, decennial census of population, 1970 (5-percent sample), 1980 to 2010, 2008 Population Projections, 2020–2042.\n Decennial census and population projections:\n   Years 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2042    Percent minority (%) 16.5 20.4 24.4 30.9 36.3 39.9 44.5 49.2 50.1    In 2009, the U.S. Census Bureau projected the future censuses as follows:[13] In 2019, the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division has different projections.[100]\n   Year  Projection (Census Bureau) (thousands) \n  Projection (UN) (thousands) \n  Actual result    2010 310,233 309,011 308,745,538    2020 341,387 331,003    2030 373,504 349,642    2040 405,655 366,572    2050 439,010 379,419     Foreign-born population[edit]  As of 2017, there is a total of 44,525,458 foreign-born people in the United States[101] that represents the 13.5% of the total population of the country. \n It is important to note that the foreign-born people are not necessarily recent immigrants. \n   Place of birth of the Foreign-born population in the United States, 2017[101]    Place of birth Estimate Percentage of total foreign-born people    Americas 23,241,959 52.2%    Caribbean 4,414,943 9.9%    &gt; Cuba  1,311,803 3.0%    &gt; Dominican Republic  1,162,568 2.6%     Central America (including Mexico) 14,796,926 33.2%    &gt; Mexico  11,269,913 25.3%    &gt; El Salvador  1,401,832 3.2%    South America 3,213,187 7.2%    Canada 809,267 1.8%    Europe 4,818,662 10.8%    Northern Europe 941,796 2.1%    Western Europe 949,591 2.1%    Southern Europe 761,390 1.7%     Eastern Europe (including Russia) 2,153,855 4.8%    Asia 13,907,844 31.2%    Eastern Asia 4,267,303 9.6%    &gt; China  2,639,365 5.9%    &gt; Korea  1,064,960 2.4%    South Central Asia 4,113,013 9.2%    &gt; India  2,348,687 5.3%    South Eastern Asia 4,318,647 6.7%    &gt; Philippines  1,945,345 4.4%    &gt; Vietnam  1,314,927 3.0%    Western Asia 1,159,835 2.6%    Africa 2,293,028 5.2%    Eastern Africa 693,784 1.6%    Middle Africa 163,364 0.4%    Northern Africa 359,559 0.8%    Southern Africa 116,297 0.2%    Western Africa 837,290 1.9%    Oceania 263,965 0.6%     Australia and New Zealand Subregion 123,080 0.3%      Religion[edit]  Main article: Religion in the United States \n  \n This article needs to be updated.

It only includes the voluntary self-reported membership of religious bodies with 750,000 or more. The definition of a member is determined by each religious body. In 2004, the US census bureau reported that about 13% of the population did not identify themselves as a member of any religion.[103][clarification needed]\n In a Pew Research Survey performed in 2012, Americans without a religion (atheists, agnostics, nothing in particular, etc.) approached the numbers of Evangelical Protestant Americans with almost 20% of Americans being nonreligious (compared to just over 26% being Evangelical Protestant). If this current growth rate continues, by 2050, around 51% of Americans will not have a religion.[104]\n A survey conducted in 2014 by the same organization indicated that the percentage of Americans unaffiliated with a religion rose to nearly 23% of the population, up from 16% in 2007.[105]\n   Religious body  Year \n reported  Places of \n worship  Membership\n(thousands)  Clergy    African

government does not collect religious data in its census. The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461 American residential households in the contiguous United States. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281. \n Adult respondents were asked the open-ended question, \"What is your religion, if any?\". Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was \"Protestant\" or \"Christian\" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one-third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions. \n Religious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008\nFigures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of \"no religion\" than any other group. \n  Source:ARIS 2008   Group 1990\nadults\n× 1,000 2001\nadults\n× 1,000 2008\nadults\n× 1,000  \nNumerical\nChange\n1990–\n2008\nas %\nof 1990 1990\n% of\nadults 2001\n% of \nadults 2008\n% of\nadults change\nin % of\ntotal\nadults\n1990–\n2008    Adult population, total 175,440 207,983 228,182 30.1%       Adult population, Responded 171,409 196,683 216,367 26.2% 97.7% 94.6% 94.8% −2.9%    Total Christian 151,225 159,514 173,402 14.7% 86.2% 76.7% 76.0% −10.2%    Catholic 46,004 50,873 57,199 24.3% 26.2% 24.5% 25.1% −1.2%    Non-Catholic Christian 105,221 108,641 116,203 10.4% 60.0% 52.2% 50.9% −9.0%    Baptist 33,964 33,820 36,148 6.4% 19.4% 16.3% 15.8% −3.5%    Mainline Protestant 32,784 35,788 29,375 −10.4% 18.7% 17.2% 12.9% −5.8%    Methodist 14,174 14,039 11,366 −19.8% 8.1% 6.8% 5.0% −3.1%    Lutheran 9,110 9,580 8,674 −4.8% 5.2% 4.6% 3.8% −1.4%    Presbyterian 4,985 5,596 4,723 −5.3% 2.8% 2.7% 2.1% −0.8%    Episcopalian/Anglican 3,043 3,451 2,405 −21.0% 1.7% 1.7% 1.1% −0.7%    United Church of Christ 438 1,378 736 68.0% 0.2% 0.7% 0.3% 0.1%    Christian Generic 25,980 22,546 32,441 24.9% 14.8% 10.8% 14.2% −0.6%    Jehovah's Witness 1,381 1,331 1,914 38.6% 0.8% 0.6% 0.8% 0.1%    Christian Unspecified 8,073 14,190 16,384 102.9% 4.6% 6.8% 7.2% 2.6%    Non-denominational Christian 194 2,489 8,032 4040.2% 0.1% 1.2% 3.5% 3.4%    Protestant – Unspecified 17,214 4,647 5,187 −69.9% 9.8% 2.2% 2.3% −7.5%    Evangelical/Born Again 546 1,088 2,154 294.5% 0.3% 0.5% 0.9% 0.6%    Pentecostal/Charismatic 5,647 7,831 7,948 40.7% 3.2% 3.8% 3.5% 0.3%    Pentecostal – Unspecified 3,116 4,407 5,416 73.8% 1.8% 2.1% 2.4% 0.6%    Assemblies of God 617 1,105 810 31.3% 0.4% 0.5% 0.4% 0.0%    Church of God 590 943 663 12.4% 0.3% 0.5% 0.3% 0.0%    Other Protestant Denomination 4,630 5,949 7,131 54.0% 2.6% 2.9% 3.1% 0.5%    Seventh-Day Adventist 668 724 938 40.4% 0.4% 0.3% 0.4% 0.0%    Churches of Christ 1,769 2,593 1,921 8.6% 1.0% 1.2% 0.8% −0.2%    Mormon/Latter-Day Saints 2,487 2,697 3,158 27.0% 1.4% 1.3% 1.4% 0.0%    Total non-Christian religions 5,853 7,740 8,796 50.3% 3.3% 3.7% 3.9% 0.5%    Jewish 3,137 2,837 2,680 −14.6% 1.8% 1.4% 1.2% −0.6%    Eastern Religions 687 2,020 1,961 185.4% 0.4% 1.0% 0.9% 0.5%    Buddhist 404 1,082 1,189 194.3% 0.2% 0.5% 0.5% 0.3%    Muslim 527 1,104 1,349 156.0% 0.3% 0.5% 0.6% 0.3%    New Religious Movements &amp; Others 1,296 1,770 2,804 116.4% 0.7% 0.9% 1.2% 0.5%    None/ No religion, total 14,331 29,481 34,169 138.4% 8.2% 14.2% 15.0% 6.8%    Agnostic+Atheist 1,186 1,893 3,606 204.0% 0.7% 0.9% 1.6% 0.9%    Did Not Know/ Refused to reply 4,031 11,300 11,815 193.1% 2.3% 5.4% 5.2% 2.9%      Income[edit]  Main articles: Household income in the United States, Personal income in the United States, Affluence in the United States, and Income inequality in the United States \n In 2006, the median household income in the United States was around $46,326.

NY, NY: Harper-Collins.    \n\n  Generational cohorts[edit]  A definitive recent study of US generational cohorts was done by Schuman and Scott (2012) in which a broad sample of adults of all ages was asked, \"What world events are especially important to you?\" They found that 33 events were mentioned with great frequency. When the ages of the respondents were correlated with the expressed importance rankings, seven (some put 8 or 9) distinct cohorts became evident. \n Today the following descriptors are frequently used for these cohorts: \n  U.S. demographic birth cohorts[edit]   Birth rate has dropped since 1957.\n \n\n Subdivided groups are present when peak boom years or inverted peak bust years are present, and may be represented by a normal or inverted bell-shaped curve (rather than a straight curve). The boom subdivided cohorts may be considered as \"pre-peak\" (including peak year) and \"post-peak\". The year 1957 was the baby boom peak with 4.3 million births and 122.7 fertility rate. Although post-peak births (such as trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and sometimes referred to as a \"bust\", there are still a relatively large number of births. The dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year, and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate. The baby boom began around 1943 to 1946.[citation needed]\n From the decline in U.S. birth rates starting in 1958 and the introduction of the birth control pill in 1960, the Baby Boomer normal distribution curve is negatively skewed. The trend in birth rates from 1958 to 1961 show a tendency to end late in the decade at approximately 1969, thus returning to pre-WWII levels, with 12 years of rising and 12 years of declining birth rates. Pre-war birth rates were defined as anywhere between 1939 and 1941 by demographers such as the Taeuber's, Philip M. Hauser and William Fielding Ogburn.\n  Demographic statistics[edit]   Birth, growth and death rates[edit]  See also: Birth rate § United States \n The growth rate is 0.81% as estimated from 2017.\n  Live births in the United States, 1934–2004\n \n\n  Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships in the US, 1970-2000\n \n\n The birth rate is 12.5 births/1,000 population, estimated as of 2017 and 2013. Country comparison to the world: 158th. This was the lowest since records began. There were 3,957,577 births in 2013.\n  13.9 births/1,000 population per year (provisional data for 2008) 14.3 births/1,000 population per year (provisional data for 2007)  In 2009, Time magazine reported that 40% of births were to unmarried women.[130] The following is a breakdown by race for unwed births: 17% Asian, 29% White, 53% Hispanics, 66% Native Americans, and 72% Black American.[131]\n The drop in the birth rate from 2007 to 2009 is believed to be associated with the Great Recession.\n A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that more than half (51 percent) of live hospital births in 2008 and 2011 were male.[133]\n Per U.S. federal government data released in March 2011, births fell 4% from 2007 to 2009, the largest drop in the U.S. for any two-year period since the 1970s.[134] Births have declined for three consecutive years, and are now 7% below the peak in 2007.[135] This drop has continued through 2010, according to data released by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics in June 2011.[136] Numerous experts have suggested that this decline is largely a reflection of unfavorable economic conditions.[137] This connection between birth rates and economic downturns partly stems from the fact that American birth rates have now fallen to levels that are comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s.[138] Teen birth rates in the U.S. are at the lowest level in U.S. history.[139] In fact, teen birth rates in the U.S. have consistently decreased since 1991 through 2011, except for a brief increase between 2005 and 2007.[139] The other aberration from this otherwise steady decline in teen birth rates is the 6% decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009.[139] Despite these years of decrease, U.S. teen birth rates are still higher than in other developed nations.[139] Racial differences prevail with teen birth and pregnancy rates as well. The American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teen birth rate.[140]\n   Age group[when?]  Total \n(of population)  White alone \n(of race/age group)  Black alone \n(of race/age group)   Mixed and/or Some Other Race\n(of race/age group)  Asian alone \n(of race/age group)  Either American Indian or Alaska Native \n(of race/age group)  Either Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander \n(of race/age group)    Total  308745538\n(100%)  223553265\n(72.41%)  38929319\n(12.61%)  28116441\n(9.11%)  14674252\n(4.75%)  2932248\n(0.95%)  540013\n(0.17%)    0–4  20201362\n(6.5%)  12795675\n(5.7%/63.34%)  2902590\n(7.5%/14.37%)  3315480\n(11.8%/16.41%)  898011\n(6.1%/4.45%)  244615\n(8.3%/1.21%)  44991\n(8.3%/0.22%)    5–9  20348657\n(6.6%)  13293799\n(5.9%/65.33%)  2882597\n(7.4%/14.17%)  2957487\n(10.5%/14.53%)  928248\n(6.3%/4.56%)  243259\n(8.3%/1.20%)  43267\n(8.0%/0.21%)    10–14  20677194\n(6.7%)  13737332\n(6.1%/66.44%)  3034266\n(7.8%/14.67%)  2736570\n(9.7%/13.23%)  881590\n(6.0%/4.26%)  245049\n(8.4%/1.19%)  42387\n(7.8%/0.20%)    15–19  22040343\n(7.1%)  14620638\n(6.5%/66.35%)  3448051\n(8.9%/15.64%)  2704571\n(9.6%/12.27%)  956028\n(6.5%/4.34%)  263805\n(9.0%/1.20%)  47250\n(8.7%/0.21%)    20–24  21585999\n(7.0%)  14535947\n(6.5%/67.34%)  3111397\n(8.0%/14.41%)  2538967\n(9.0%/11.76%)  1106222\n(7.5%/5.12%)  240716\n(8.2%/1.12%)  52750\n(9.8%/0.24%)    25–29  21101849\n(6.8%)  14345364\n(6.4%/67.98%)  2786254\n(7.2%/13.20%)  2464343\n(8.8%/11.68%)  1234322\n(8.4%/5.85%)  221654\n(7.6%/1.05%)  49912\n(9.2%/0.24%)    30–34  19962099\n(6.5%)  13573270\n(6.1%/68.00%)  2627925\n(6.8%/13.16%)  2273322\n(8.1%/11.39%)  1240906\n(8.5%/6.22%)  202928\n(6.9%/1.02%)  43748\n(8.1%/0.22%)    35–39  20179642\n(6.5%)  13996797\n(6.3%/69.36%)  2613389\n(6.7%/12.95%)  2038408\n(7.2%/10.10%)  1296301\n(8.8%/6.42%)  196017\n(6.7%/0.97%)  38730\n(7.2%/0.19%)    40–44  20890964\n(6.8%)  15052798\n(6.7%/72.05%)  2669034\n(6.9%/12.78%)  1782463\n(6.3%/8.53%)  1155565\n(7.9%/5.53%)  194713\n(6.6%/0.93%)  36391\n(6.7%/0.17%)    45–49  22708591\n(7.4%)  17028255\n(7.6%/74.99%)  2828657\n(7.3%/12,46%)  1532117\n(5.4%/6.75%)  1076060\n(7.3%/4.74%)  207857\n(7.1%/0.92%)  35645\n(6.6%/0.16%)    50–54  22298125\n(7.2%)  17178632\n(7.7%/77.04%)  2694247\n(6.9%/12.08%)  1222175\n(4.3%/5.48%)  980282\n(6.7%/4.40%)  191893\n(6.5%/0.86%)  30896\n(5.7%/0.14%)    55–59  19664805\n(6.4%)  15562187\n(7.0%/79.14%)  2205820\n(5.7%/11.22%)  873943\n(3.1%/4.44%)  844490\n(5.8%/4.29%)  154320\n(5.3%/0.78%)  24045\n(4.5%/0.12%)    60–64  16817924\n(5.4%)  13693334\n(6.1%/81.42%)  1686695\n(4.3%/10.03%)  611144\n(2.2%/3.63%)  689601\n(4.7%/4.10%)  118362\n(4.0%/0.70%)  18788\n(3.5%/0.11%)    65–69  12435263\n(4.0%)  10313002\n(4.6%/82.93%)  1162577\n(3.0%/9.35%)  394208\n(1.4%/3.17%)  474327\n(3.2%/3.81%)  79079\n(2.7%/0.64%)  12070\n(2.2%/0.10%)    70–74  9278166\n(3.0%)  7740932\n(3.5%/83.43%)  852317\n(2.2%/9.19%)  268574\n(1.0%/2.89%)  354268\n(2.4%/3.82%)  53926\n(1.8%/0.58%)  8149\n(1.5%/0.09%)    75–79  7317795\n(2.4%)  6224569\n(2.8%/85.06%)  616789\n(1.6%/8.43%)  184596\n(0.7%/2.52%)  251210\n(1.7%/3.43%)  35268\n(1.2%/0.48%)  5363\n(1.0%/0.07%)    80–84  5743327\n(1.9%)  5002427\n(2.2%/87.10%)  424592\n(1.1%/7.39%)  122249\n(0.4%/2.13%)  168879\n(1.2%/2.94%)  21963\n(0.7%/0.38%)  3217\n(0.6%/0.06%)    85+  5493433\n(1.8%)  4858307\n(2.2%/88.44%)  382122\n(1.0%/6.96%)  95824\n(0.3%/1.74%)  137942\n(0.9%/2.51%)  16824\n(0.6%/0.31%)  2414\n(0.4%/0.04%)     U.S. unemployment by state in December 2015 (official, or U3 rate).[141]  &lt;3.0%\n  &lt;3.5%\n  &lt;4.0%\n  &lt;4.5%\n  &lt;5.0%\n  &lt;5.5%\n  &lt;6.0%\n  &lt;6.5%\n  ≥6.5%\n \n \n \n\n  Unemployment rate[edit]  As of July 2018, the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.7 percent (U3 rate). \n As of July 2017, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.3 percent (U3 rate).\n As of July 2016, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.9 percent (U3 rate).\n As of July 2015, the U.S. unemployment rate was 5.3 percent (U3 rate).[143]\n As of July 2014, the U.S. unemployment rate was 6.2 percent (U3 rate).\n The U6 unemployment rate as of April 2017 was 8.6 percent.[144] The U6 unemployment rate counts not only people without work seeking full-time employment (the more familiar U3 rate), but also counts \"marginally attached workers and those working part-time for economic reasons.\" Note that some of these part-time workers counted as employed by U6 could be working as little as an hour a week. And the \"marginally attached workers\" include those who have gotten discouraged and stopped looking, but still want to work. The age considered for this calculation is 16 years and over.[145]\n  Mobility[edit]  In terms of internal migration, in 2013, about 15% of Americans moved.[citation needed] Most of these, 67%, moved within the same county. Of the 33% who moved beyond local county boundaries, 13% of those moved more than 200 miles (320 km).[146]\n  See also[edit]  \n  This article is part of a series on Income in the\nUnited States of America   Topics\n \n \n  Lists by income\n \n \n  United States portal  \n  Lists:\n Income:\n Population:\n  Notes[edit]    ^TFR for other races/ethnicities were not included in the United States Department of Health and Human Services annual report \n  ^In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and have been marked blue, 2 and below leads an aging population and the result is that the population reduces.  \n \n\n  References[edit]    ^ abc\"Population Clock\".

The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. \n In contemporary times, the president is looked upon as one of the world's most powerful political figures as the leader of the only remaining global superpower.[13][14][15] The role includes responsibility for the world's most expensive military, which has the second largest nuclear arsenal. The president also leads the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP. The president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power. \n Article II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government. It vests the executive power of the United States in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law, alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the Senate. The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances.[16] The president directs the foreign and domestic policies of the United States, and takes an active role in promoting his policy priorities to members of Congress.[17] In addition, as part of the system of checks and balances, Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. The power of the presidency has grown substantially since its formation, as has the power of the federal government as a whole.[18]\n Through the Electoral College, registered voters indirectly elect the president and vice president to a four-year term. This is the only federal election in the United States which is not decided by popular vote.[19] Nine vice presidents became president by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation.[C]\n Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 sets three qualifications for holding the presidency: natural-born U.S. citizenship; at least thirty-five years of age; and residency in the United States for at least fourteen years. The Twenty-second Amendment states that no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In all, 44 individuals have served 45 presidencies spanning 57 full four-year terms.Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms, so he is counted twice, as both the 22nd and 24th president.\n Donald Trump of New York is the 45th and current president of the United States. He assumed office on January 20, 2017. \n Contents\n\n Origin In July 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies, acting jointly through the Second Continental Congress, declared themselves to be 13 independent sovereign states, no longer under British rule. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British, the Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the states together. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government. Congress finished work on the Articles of Confederation to establish a perpetual union between the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for ratification.\n Under the Articles, which took effect on March 1, 1781, the Congress of the Confederation was a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens. This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire. The states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a president of the United States in Congress Assembled to preside over its deliberation as a neutral discussion moderator. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position without much influence.\n In 1783, the Treaty of Paris secured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs. By 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their Mediterranean commerce preyed upon by North Africanpirates, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest. Civil and political unrest loomed. \n Following the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between Virginia and Maryland at the Mount Vernon Conference in 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in Annapolis, Maryland, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the convention failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, Alexander Hamilton led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in Philadelphia. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until James Madison and Edmund Randolph succeeded in securing George Washington's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.\n When the Constitutional Convention convened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (Rhode Island did not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.New York offered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter. It was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the U.S. Constitution emerged. \n Powers and duties Main article: Powers of the president of the United States \n Article I legislative role  President Ronald Reagan signs the Martin Luther King bill, 1983.\n \n\n  President George W. Bush delivers the 2007 State of the Union Address, with Vice PresidentDick Cheney and Speaker of the HouseNancy Pelosi.\n \n\n The Presentment Clause requires that any bill passed by Congress must be presented to the president before it can become law. Once the legislation has been presented, the president has three options: \n  Sign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays – the bill becomes law.\n  Veto the legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections – the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a two-thirds vote.\n Take no action on the legislation within the above timeframe – the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law (a pocket veto).\n  The president can also be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting or even insisting that Congress enact laws he believes are needed. Additionally, he can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress. Presidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution, bolstered by Article I, Section 8, puts all lawmaking power in Congress's hands, and Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2 prevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress. \n The president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. The president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally (e.g. Article II, Section 3) or statutorily mandated periodic reports to Congress. These reports may be either written or oral, but today the greatest in importance is given as the oral State of the Union addresses, which often outline the president's legislative proposals for the coming year. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\n In the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \"virtual army of 'czars' – each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\".[30] Presidents have been criticized for making signing statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.[31] This practice has been criticized by the American Bar Association as unconstitutional. Conservative commentator George Will wrote of an \"increasingly swollen executive branch\" and \"the eclipse of Congress\".[33]\n Article II executive powers War and foreign affairs powers   Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, successfully preserved the Union during the American Civil War.\n \n\n One of the most important of executive powers is the president's role as commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate responsibility for the direction and disposition of the military. The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority.[34]\n The amount of military detail handled personally by the president in wartime has varied greatly.[35]George Washington, the first U.S. president, firmly established military subordination under civilian authority. In 1794, Washington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the Whiskey Rebellion—a conflict in western Pennsylvania involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay an excise tax on spirits. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was the \"first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\", though James Madison briefly took control of artillery units in defense of Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812.[36]Abraham Lincoln was deeply involved in overall strategy and in day-to-day operations during the American Civil War, 1861–1865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to select and encourage commanders such as Ulysses S. Grant.[37]\n  The present-day operational command of the Armed Forces is delegated to the Department of Defense and is normally exercised through the secretary of defense. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commands assist with the operation as outlined in the presidentially approved Unified Command Plan (UCP).[38][39][40] The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explained this in Federalist No. 69:\n The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States. ... It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces ... while that [the power] of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all [of] which ... would appertain to the legislature.[41] [Emphasis in the original.] \n  Pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, Congress must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual. Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. Presidents have historically initiated the process for going to war,[43][44] but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903,[43] the Korean War,[43] the Vietnam War,[43] and the invasions of Grenada in 1983[45] and Panama in 1989.[46]\n The Constitution also empowers the president to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements between the United States and other countries. Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a two-thirds majority vote), become binding with the force of federal law. \n Administrative powers  Suffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\n Nixon v. General Services Administration, (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)\n \n The president is head of the executive branch of the federal government and is constitutionally obligated to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\".[47] The executive branch has over four million employees, including the military.[48]\n Presidents make numerous executive branch appointments: an incoming president may make up to 6,000 before taking office and 8,000 more while serving. Ambassadors, members of the Cabinet, and other federal officers, are all appointed by a president with the \"advice and consent\" of a majority of the Senate. When the Senate is in recess for at least ten days, the president may make recess appointments.[49] Recess appointments are temporary and expire at the end of the next session of the Senate. \n The power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue. Generally, a president may remove executive officials purely at will.[50] However, Congress can curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute.[51]\n To manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Within the Executive Office, the president's innermost layer of aides (and their assistants) are located in the White House Office. \n To allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution to call a special session of one our both houses of Congress. Since John Adams first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. Harry Truman was the most recent to do so in July 1948 (the so-called \"Turnip Day Session\"). In addition, prior to ratification of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly inaugurated presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this administrative power.[53]\n The president also possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government through issuing various types of directives, such as presidential proclamation and executive orders. When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.[54] Even so, these directives are subject to judicial review by U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional. Moreover, Congress can overturn an executive order through legislation (e.g., Congressional Review Act). \n Juridical powers The president has power to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, these nominations require Senate confirmation before they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to U.S. district courts, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of senatorial courtesy. Presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon a month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when Bill Clinton pardoned Patty Hearst on his last day in office; this is often controversial.[55][56][57]\n For further information, see List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States.\n Ceremonial roles  President Woodrow Wilson throws out the ceremonial first ball on Opening Day, 1916\n \n\n The president fulfills many ceremonial duties. William Howard Taft started the tradition of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch in 1910 at Griffith Stadium, Washington, D.C., on the Washington Senators'sOpening Day. Every president since Taft, except for Jimmy Carter, threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening Day, the All-Star Game, or the World Series, usually with much fanfare.[66] Every president since Theodore Roosevelt has served as honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America.[67]\n Other presidential traditions are associated with American holidays. Rutherford B. Hayes began in 1878 the first White House egg rolling for local children.[68] Beginning in 1947, during the Harry S. Truman administration, every Thanksgiving the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation held at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of \"pardoning\" the turkey was formalized by George H. W. Bush, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.[69]\n Presidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since James Buchanan traditionally give advice to their successor during the presidential transition.[70]Ronald Reagan and his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on Inauguration Day for the incoming president.[71]\n   \n\n Four ruffles and flourishes and 'Hail to the Chief' (long version)\n\n    Problems playing this file? See media help.   During a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961. This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening.[73]\n The modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \"propagandized leadership\" which has a \"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\".[74] Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted photo-ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.[75] One critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \"in rich detail\" which \"drew on the power of myth\" regarding the incident of PT 109[76] and wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.[77] As a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\".[78]\n Critics of presidency's evolution Main articles: Imperial Presidency and Imperiled Presidency \n The nation's Founding Fathers expected the Congress—which was the first branch of government described in the Constitution—to be the dominant branch of government; they did not expect a strong executive department.[79] However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful,[80][81] unchecked, unbalanced, and \"monarchist\" in nature.[83] Professor Dana D. Nelson believes presidents over the past thirty years have worked towards \"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\".[84] She criticizes proponents of the unitary executive for expanding \"the many existing uncheckable executive powers – such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements – that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress\".[84]Bill Wilson, board member of Americans for Limited Government, opined that the expanded presidency was \"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\".[85]\n Selection process   George Washington, the first president of the United States\n \n\n Eligibility Article II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must: \n A person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions: \n Campaigns and nomination Main articles: United States presidential primary, United States presidential nominating convention, United States presidential election debates, and United States presidential election \n The modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections, which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions, where the most successful candidate is made the party's nominee for president. Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention. The most common previous profession of U.S. presidents is lawyer.[91]\n Nominees participate in nationally televised debates, and while the debates are usually restricted to the Democratic and Republican nominees, third party candidates may be invited, such as Ross Perot in the 1992 debates. Nominees campaign across the country to explain their views, convince voters and solicit contributions. Much of the modern electoral process is concerned with winning swing states through frequent visits and mass media advertising drives. \n Election  Map of the United States showing the number of electoral votes allocated following the 2010 census to each state and the District of Columbia for the 2012, 2016 and 2020 presidential elections; it also notes that Maine and Nebraska distribute electors by way of the Congressional District Method. 270 electoral votes are required for a majority out of 538 votes possible.\n \n\n Main article: Electoral College (United States) \n The president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms. As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state. Currently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election held on Election Day.[93] In all but two states, the party whose presidential-vice presidential ticket receives a plurality of popular votes in the state has its entire slate of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.[94]Maine and Nebraska deviate from this winner-take-all practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district.[95][96]\n On the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the party that nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 30 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are pledged.[93][97] Following the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an absolute majority of electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the House of Representatives must meet to elect a president using a contingent election procedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top electoral vote-getters for president. For a candidate to win, he or she must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).[93]\n There have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73–73 electoral vote tie between Thomas Jefferson and fellow Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr in the election of 1800 necessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 of the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the runner-up would become vice president.[98] On February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr became vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the Twelfth Amendment in time to be used in the 1804 election.[99] A quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the election of 1824. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and William H. Crawford. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.[100]\n Tenure Inauguration Main article: United States presidential inauguration \n Pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and vice president begins at noon on January 20.[101] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937. Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933–37) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.[103]\n Before executing the powers of the office, a president is required to recite the presidential oath of office, found in Article II, Section 1, Clause 8. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution: \n I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.[104]\n Presidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a Bible while taking the oath, and have added \"So help me God\" to the end of the oath.[105][106] Although the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the chief justice of the United States.[104]\n Term limit When the first president, George Washington, announced in his Farewell Address that he was not running for a third term, he established a \"two-terms then out\" precedent. Precedent became tradition after Thomas Jefferson publicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe.[107] In spite of the strong two-term tradition, Ulysses S. Grant sought a non-consecutive third term in 1880,[108] as did Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 (though it would have been only his second full term).[109] Both were unsuccessful. \n   Franklin D. Roosevelt won a record four presidential elections (1932, 1936, 1940 and 1944).\n \n\n In 1940, after leading the nation through the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the self-imposed precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in World War II, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.[110]\n In response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted in 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term. Harry S. Truman, president when this term limit came into force, was exempted from its limitations, and briefly sought a second full term—to which he would have otherwise been ineligible for election, as he had been president for more than two years of Roosevelt's fourth term—before he withdrew from the 1952 election.[110]\n Since the amendment's adoption, five presidents have served two full terms: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Both Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush sought a second term but were defeated. Richard Nixon was elected to a second term, but resigned before completing it. Lyndon B. Johnson, having held the presidency for one full term in addition to only 14 months of John F. Kennedy's unexpired term, was eligible for a second full term in 1968, but withdrew from Democratic Primary. Additionally, Gerald Ford, who served out the last two years and five months of Nixon's second term, sought a full term but was defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election. \n Impeachment Further information: Impeachment in the United States \n Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 authorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \"grand jury\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.[111]Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 authorizes the Senate to serve as a court with the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.\n Two presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. Both were acquitted by the Senate: Johnson by one vote, and Clinton by 17 votes. Additionally, the House Judiciary Committee commenced impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon in 1974; however, he resigned from office before the full House voted on the articles of impeachment.[111]\n Succession and disability Vacancies and succession in the office of president may arise under several possible circumstances: death, resignation, and removal from office. Deaths have occurred a number of times, a resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred. \n The Constitution, in Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, stipulates that the vice president takes over the \"powers and duties\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.[113] Even so, it does not clearly state whether the vice president would become President of the United States or simply act as president in a case of succession.[114] This ambiguity was alleviated in 1967 by Section 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which unequivocally states that the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or resignation of the president. \n Under Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes acting president, by transmitting a statement to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate stating the reasons for the transfer. The president resumes the discharge of the presidential powers and duties upon transmitting, to those two officials, a written declaration stating that resumption. Such a transfer of power has occurred on three occasions: Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush once, on July 13, 1985, and George W. Bush to Dick Cheney twice, on June 29, 2002, and on July 21, 2007.[115]\n Under Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the vice president, in conjunction with a majority of the Cabinet, may transfer the presidential powers and duties from the president to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate that the president is incapacitated—unable to discharge their presidential powers and duties. If this occurs, then the vice president will assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president; however, the president can declare that no such inability exists and resume the discharge of the presidential powers and duties. If the vice president and Cabinet contest this claim, it is up to Congress, which must meet within two days if not already in session, to decide the merit of the claim. \n Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President.\"[114] The Presidential Succession Act of 1947, (codified as 3 U.S.C.§ 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the presidential line of succession follows the order of: Speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of federal executive departments who form the president's Cabinet. The Cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those department heads who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.[116]\n Political affiliation Political parties have dominated American politics for most of the nation's history. Though the Founding Fathers generally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid–1790s nonetheless. They evolved from political factions, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the Washington administration were referred to as \"pro-administration\" and would eventually form the Federalist Party, while those in opposition joined the emerging Democratic-Republican Party.[117]\n Greatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.[118][119] Since George Washington, 43 persons have been sworn into the office of president, and each has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office. The number of presidents per political party (at the time of entry into office) are:\n   Party  # Name(s)     Republican 19   Chester A. Arthur, George H. W. Bush, George W.

The president's salary is set by Congress, and under Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution, may not be increased or reduced during his or her current term of office.\n Residence Main article: List of residences of Presidents of the United States \n  South lawn of the White House \n \n\n The White House in Washington, D.C. is the official residence of the president. The site was selected by George Washington, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792. Every president since John Adams (in 1800) has lived there. At various times in U.S. history, it has been known as the \"President's Palace,\" the \"President's House,\" and the \"Executive Mansion.\" Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901. Facilities that are available to the president include access to the White House staff, medical care, recreation, housekeeping, and security services. The federal government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food.\n Camp David, officially titled Naval Support Facility Thurmont, a mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, is the president's country residence. A place of solitude and tranquility, the site has been used extensively to host foreign dignitaries since the 1940s.\n Blair House, located next to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House Complex and Lafayette Park, serves as the president's official guest house and as a secondary residence for the president if needed. Four interconnected, 19th century houses—Blair House, Lee House, and 700 and 704 Jackson Place—with a combined floor space exceeding 70,000 square feet (6,500 m2) comprise the property.\n Travel Main article: Transportation of the President of the United States \n The primary means of long-distance air travel for the president is one of two identical Boeing VC-25 aircraft, which are extensively modified Boeing 747 airliners and are referred to as Air Force One while the president is on board (although any U.S. Air Force aircraft the president is aboard is designated as \"Air Force One\" for the duration of the flight). In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the Boeing C-32, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet. Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated Executive One for the flight.[130][131]\n For short-distance air travel, the president has access to a fleet of U.S. Marine Corps helicopters of varying models, designated Marine One when the president is aboard any particular one in the fleet. Flights are typically handled with as many as five helicopters all flying together and frequently swapping positions as to disguise which helicopter the president is actually aboard to any would-be threats. \n For ground travel, the president uses the presidential state car, which is an armored limousine designed to look like a Cadillac sedan, but built on a truck chassis.[133] The US Secret Service operates and maintains the fleet of several limousines. The president also has access to two armored motorcoaches, which are primarily used for touring trips.[134]\n Protection The U.S. Secret Service is charged with protecting the president and the first family. As part of their protection, presidents, first ladies, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames.[135] The use of such names was originally for security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic communications were not routinely encrypted; today, the names simply serve for purposes of brevity, clarity, and tradition.[136]\n Post-presidency  Four presidents and one then-president-elect. From left to right: George H. W. Bush, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter. Photo taken in the Oval Office on January 7, 2009; Obama formally took office thirteen days later.\n \n\n Under the Former Presidents Act, all living former presidents are granted a pension, an office, and a staff. The pension has increased numerous times with Congressional approval. Retired presidents now receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 each year in 2012.[137] Former presidents who served in Congress may also collect congressional pensions.[138] The act also provides former presidents with travel funds and franking privileges. Prior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.[139][140] In 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.[141] On January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him, George W. Bush, and all subsequent presidents. A spouse who remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.[141]\n Some presidents have had significant careers after leaving office. Prominent examples include William Howard Taft's tenure as Chief Justice of the United States and Herbert Hoover's work on government reorganization after World War II. Grover Cleveland, whose bid for reelection failed in 1888, was elected president again four years later in 1892. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House: John Quincy Adams was elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for seventeen years, and Andrew Johnson returned to the Senate in 1875. John Tyler served in the provisional Congress of the Confederate States during the Civil War and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives, but died before that body first met. \n As of July 2019, there are four living former U.S. presidents. The most recent former president to die was George H. W. Bush (1989–1993), on November 30, 2018. The living former presidents, in order of service, are: \n Presidential libraries Main article: Presidential library \n \n Every president since Herbert Hoover has created a repository known as a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials. Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.[146] There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, such as the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the State of Illinois, the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by Southern Methodist University, the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by Texas A&amp;M University, and the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the University of Texas at Austin. \n A number of presidents have lived for many years after leaving office, and several of them have personally overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some have even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document, including the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home in Abilene, Kansas, Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California, and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. These gravesites are open to the general public. \n See also \n References Footnotes\n   ^Donald Trump has announced he will take a salary of only 1 dollar per annum.[10] \n  ^The informal term POTUS originated in the Phillips Code, a shorthand method created in 1879 by Walter P.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 contains only vague consultation requirements. Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \"pursuant\" to these triggering provisions. \n  ^ abcd\"The Law: The President's War Powers\".

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases only represent a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

<b>America</b>, is a <span>country</span> comprising 50 <span>states</span>, a <span>federal district</span>, five major <span>self-governing territories</span>, and <span>various possessions</span>.<sup><span>[i]</span></sup> At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2</sup>), the United States is the world's <span>third or fourth largest country by total area</span><sup><span>[d]</span></sup> and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of <span>Europe</span>, which is 3.9 million square miles (10.1 million km<sup>2</sup>). With a population of over 327 million people, the U.S. is the <span>third most populous country</span>. The capital is <span>Washington, D.C.</span>, and the <span>most populous city</span> is <span>New York City</span>. Most of the country is located <span>contiguously</span> in <span>North America</span> between <span>Canada</span> and <span>Mexico</span>. </p>\n <p><span>Paleo-Indians</span><span>migrated from Siberia</span> to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago.<span>European colonization</span> began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the <span>thirteen British colonies</span> established along the <span>East Coast</span>. Following the <span>French and Indian War</span>, numerous disputes between <span>Great Britain</span> and the colonies led to the <span>American Revolution</span>, which began in 1775, and the <span>Declaration of Independence</span> in 1776. The war <span>ended in 1783</span> with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a <span>colonial empire</span>. The <span>current constitution</span> was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the <span>Bill of Rights</span>, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many <span>fundamental civil liberties</span>. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, <span>acquiring new territories</span>,<span>displacing Native American tribes</span>, and gradually <span>admitting new states</span> until it spanned the continent by 1848.</p>\n <p>During the second half of the 19th century, the <span>Civil War</span> led to the abolition of <span>slavery</span>. By the end of the century, the United States had reached the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the <span>Industrial Revolution</span>, began to soar. The <span>Spanish–American War</span> and <span><span>World War I</span></span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span><span>World War II</span></span> as a global <span>superpower</span>, the <span>first country to develop nuclear weapons</span>, the only country to <span>use them in warfare</span>, and a <span>permanent member</span> of the <span>United Nations Security Council</span>. Sweeping civil rights legislation passed under President <span>Lyndon B. Johnson</span>, notably the <span>Civil Rights Act of 1964</span>, the <span>Voting Rights Act of 1965</span> and the <span>Fair Housing Act of 1968</span>, outlawed discrimination based on race or color and established the country as a full <span>liberal democracy</span>. During the <span>Cold War</span>, the United States and the <span>Soviet Union</span> competed in the <span>Space Race</span>, culminating with the <span>1969 U.S. Moon landing</span>. The end of the Cold War and the <span>collapse of the Soviet Union</span> in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.</p>\n <p>The United States is the world's oldest surviving <span>federation</span>. It is a <span>federal republic</span> and a <span>representative democracy</span>.

Col. Joseph Reed</span>. Moylan expressed his wish to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort.<sup><span>[41]</span></sup><sup><span>[43]</span></sup> The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in <i><span>The Virginia Gazette</span></i> newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.<sup><span>[44]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The second draft of the <span>Articles of Confederation</span>, prepared by <span>John Dickinson</span> and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared \"The name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America<span>'</span>\".<sup><span>[45]</span></sup> The final version of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence \"The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America<span>'</span>\".<sup><span>[46]</span></sup> In June 1776, <span>Thomas Jefferson</span> wrote the phrase \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his \"original Rough draught\" of the <span>Declaration of Independence</span>.<sup><span>[45]</span></sup> This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.<sup><span>[45]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The short form \"United States\" is also standard. Other common forms are the \"U.S.\", the \"USA\", and \"America\". Colloquial names are the \"U.S. of A.\" and, internationally, the \"States\". \"<span>Columbia</span>\", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from <span>Christopher Columbus</span>; it appears in the name \"<span>District of Columbia</span>\", many landmarks and institutions in the Western Hemisphere bear his name, including the country of <span>Colombia</span>.<sup><span>[47]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The phrase \"United States\" was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., \"the United States are\"—including in the <span>Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</span>, ratified in 1865.<sup><span>[48]</span></sup> The singular form—e.g., \"the United States is\"—became popular after the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom \"these United States\". The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.<sup><span>[49]</span></sup></p>\n <p>A <span>citizen of the United States</span> is an \"<span>American</span>\". \"United States\", \"American\" and \"U.S.\" refer to the country adjectivally (\"American values\", \"U.S. forces\").

It is likely these represent the first of three major waves of migrations into North America.<sup><span>[57]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the <span>pre-Columbian</span><span>Mississippian culture</span> in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies.<sup><span>[58]</span></sup> The Mississippian culture flourished in the south from 800 to 1600 AD, extending from the Mexican border down through Florida.<sup><span>[59]</span></sup> Its city state <span>Cahokia</span> is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian <span>archaeological site</span> in the modern-day United States.<sup><span>[60]</span></sup> In the <span>Four Corners</span> region, <span>Ancestral Puebloans</span> culture developed as the culmination of centuries of agricultural experimentation, which produced greater dependence on farming.<sup><span>[61]</span></sup> Three <span>UNESCO World Heritage Sites</span> in the United States are credited to the Pueblos: <span>Mesa Verde National Park</span>, <span>Chaco Culture National Historical Park</span>, and <span>Taos Pueblo</span>.<sup><span>[63]</span></sup> The earthworks constructed by Native Americans of the <span>Poverty Point</span> culture in northeastern <span>Louisiana</span> have also been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. In the southern <span>Great Lakes</span> region, the <span>Iroquois Confederacy</span> (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.<sup><span>[64]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The date of the first settlements of the <span>Hawaiian Islands</span> is a topic of continuing debate.<sup><span>[65]</span></sup><span>Archaeological</span> evidence seems to indicate a settlement as early as 124 AD.<sup><span>[66]</span></sup></p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty><span>Effects on and interaction with native populations</span></h3> <div role=note>Further information: <span>American Indian Wars</span>, <span>Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas</span>, and <span>Native American disease and epidemics</span> </div>\n <p>With the progress of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the <span>Native Americans</span> were often <span>conquered and displaced</span>.<sup><span>[67]</span></sup> The <span>native population of America declined</span> after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as <span>smallpox</span> and <span>measles</span>.<sup><span>[68]</span></sup><sup><span>[69]</span></sup></p>\n <p>While estimating the original native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult, an attempt was made in the early part of the twentieth century by <span>James Mooney</span> using historic records to estimate the indigenous population north of <span>Mexico</span> in 1600.<sup><span>[70]</span></sup><sup><span>[71]</span></sup> In more recent years, <span>Douglas H. Ubelaker</span> of the <span>Smithsonian Institution</span> has updated these figures. While Ubelaker estimated that there was a population of 92,916 in the south Atlantic states and a population of 473,616 in the Gulf states, most academics regard the figure as too low.<sup><span>[70]</span></sup><span>Anthropologist</span><span>Henry F. Dobyns</span> believed that the populations were much higher, suggesting 1,100,000 along the shores of the gulf of Mexico, 2,211,000 people living between <span>Florida</span> and <span>Massachusetts</span>, 5,250,000 in the <span>Mississippi Valley</span> and tributaries and 697,000 people in the <span>Florida peninsula</span>.<sup><span>[70]</span></sup><sup><span>[71]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The first interaction between Europeans and Native Americans was made by the <span>Norsemen</span>. A number of surviving Norse <span>sagas</span> provide information regarding <span>The Maritimes</span> and its indigenous people. The Norse attempted to settle in North America about 500 years before Columbus.<sup><span>[73]</span></sup><sup><span>[74]</span></sup><sup><span>[75]</span></sup></p>\n <p>In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their <span>colonial wars</span>. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.<sup><span>[76]</span></sup> Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans, and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.<sup><span>[77]</span></sup><sup><span>[78]</span></sup></p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty><span>European settlements</span></h3> <div role=note>Further information: <span>Colonial history of the United States</span>, <span>European colonization of the Americas</span>, and <span>Thirteen Colonies</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/LOGY3i73oth5PREVxhrnzacNjgJB63B_RGpBFInUH7CemxfLX6R36w==/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/n4RaAhyQHZAtg1Hgp1chWVErt4CsETKKp2OikOOnthFXRdrYoYkUhAOwOIs=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/View_of_St._Augustine_FL_at_intersection_of_Cathedral_Pl_and_Charlotte_St_20160707_1.jpg/220px-View_of_St._Augustine_FL_at_intersection_of_Cathedral_Pl_and_Charlotte_St_20160707_1.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>St. Augustine, Florida</span>, the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States (1565)<sup><span>[79]</span></sup> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/10zEcKAdzuYMmKaaPnOFKb3GwF3qwjCyN1RZlMlkl98AkkwMCB9QIg==/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/qtRhWOAJzRzK5yBF4EIhf7y_0CXqXUAt2eg2Gt_i3keNgOpDOHATZTXXieg=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/The_Mayflower_Compact_1620_cph.3g07155.jpg/220px-The_Mayflower_Compact_1620_cph.3g07155.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <i>The <span>Mayflower Compact</span>, 1620</i> by <span>Jean Leon Gerome Ferris</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>With the advancement of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the <span>Native Americans</span> were often <span>conquered and displaced</span>.<sup><span>[80]</span></sup> The first Europeans to arrive in the territory of the modern United States were Spanish <span>conquistadors</span> such as <span>Juan Ponce de León</span>, who made his first visit to Florida in 1513; however, if <span>unincorporated territories</span> are accounted for, then credit would go to <span>Christopher Columbus</span> who landed in <span>Puerto Rico</span> on his <span>1493 voyage</span>. The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as <span>Saint Augustine</span><sup><span>[79]</span></sup> and <span>Santa Fe</span>. The French established their own as well along the <span>Mississippi River</span>. Successful <span>English settlement</span> on the eastern coast of North America began with the <span>Virginia Colony</span> in 1607 at <span>Jamestown</span> and the <span>Pilgrims'</span><span>Plymouth Colony</span> in 1620. Many settlers were <span>dissenting Christian groups</span> who came seeking <span>religious freedom</span>. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's <span>House of Burgesses</span> created in 1619, the <span>Mayflower Compact</span>, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the <span>Fundamental Orders of Connecticut</span>, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.<sup><span>[81]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. <span>Cash crops</span> included tobacco, rice, and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period, Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply.<sup><span>[83]</span></sup> Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of <span>Scotch-Irish</span> and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed <span>indentured servants</span> pushed further west.<sup><span>[84]</span></sup></p>\n <p>A large-scale slave trade with English privateers was begun.<sup><span>[85]</span></sup> The life expectancy of slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves.<sup><span>[86]</span></sup><sup><span>[87]</span></sup> Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.<sup><span>[88]</span></sup><sup><span>[89]</span></sup> But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.<sup><span>[90]</span></sup></p>\n <p>With the British colonization of <span>Georgia</span> in 1732, the <span>13 colonies</span> that would become the United States of America were established.<sup><span>[91]</span></sup> All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient <span>rights of Englishmen</span> and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism. With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.<sup><span>[93]</span></sup> The <span>Christian revivalist</span> movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the <span>Great Awakening</span> fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.<sup><span>[94]</span></sup></p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/oY1-eQROAnte4oCs8jRbcXNNvxyiq8y-yE186uhYiLYho6yc2iDqqw==/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/P5bqHJ5YkSE4W9mljHuPdDYX4Be5FRHWGc3y7_Pa2rJWzhATiH33F8YkvZA=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/North_America_1748.PNG/200px-North_America_1748.PNG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The <span>Thirteen Colonies</span> and neighboring polities in 1748</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>During the <span>Seven Years' War</span> (in the United States, known as the <span>French and Indian War</span>), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the <span>francophone</span> population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies.

Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.<sup><span>[95]</span></sup> The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated <span>monarchs</span> to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.<sup><span>[96]</span></sup></p>\n <p>In 1774, the <span>Spanish Navy</span> ship <i>Santiago</i>, under <span>Juan Pérez</span>, entered and anchored in an inlet of <span>Nootka Sound</span>, Vancouver Island, in present-day British Columbia.

Initially, states entering the Union had alternated between <span>slave and free states</span>, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.</p>\n <p>With the <span>1860 election</span> of <span>Abraham Lincoln</span>, the first president from the largely anti-slavery <span>Republican Party</span>, conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the <span>Confederate States of America</span> (the \"South\"), while the federal government (the \"<span>Union</span>\") maintained that secession was illegal. In order to bring about this secession, military action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind. The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians. The South fought for the freedom to own slaves, while the Union at first simply fought to maintain the country as one united whole. Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his <span>Emancipation Proclamation</span>, the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the <span>Thirteenth Amendment</span>, which prohibited slavery. </p>\n <p><span>Three amendments</span> were added to the U.S. Constitution in the years after the war: the aforementioned Thirteenth as well as the <span>Fourteenth Amendment</span> providing citizenship to the nearly four million <span>African Americans</span> who had been slaves,<sup><span>[130]</span></sup> and the <span>Fifteenth Amendment</span> ensuring in theory that African Americans had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in <span>federal power</span><sup><span>[131]</span></sup> aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the South while guaranteeing the rights of the newly freed slaves. </p>\n <p><span>Reconstruction</span> began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, <span>an assassin's bullet</span> on April 14, 1865, drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the <span>Compromise of 1877</span> when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the <span>presidential election of 1876</span>. </p>\n <p>Southern white Democrats, calling themselves \"<span>Redeemers</span>\", took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction. From 1890 to 1910, so-called <span>Jim Crow laws</span><span>disenfranchised</span> most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region.

The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements and a relative decline in unemployment. Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there has been debate about its effects on the economy.</p>\n <p>American forces in Iraq were <span>withdrawn</span> in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and the war in the region was declared formally over in December 2011. The withdrawal caused <span>an escalation of sectarian insurgency</span>, leading to the rise of the <span>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</span>, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region. In 2014, Obama announced a <span>restoration</span> of full <span>diplomatic relations with Cuba</span> for the first time since 1961.<sup>[<i><span><span title=\"The date of the event predicted near this tag has passed.

State courts conduct most criminal trials; <span>federal courts</span> handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. <span>Plea bargaining</span> is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by <span>plea bargain</span> rather than <span>jury trial</span>.<sup><span>[477]</span></sup></p>\n <p>In 2015, there were 15,696 murders which was 1,532 more than in 2014, a 10.8% increase, the largest since 1971.<sup><span>[478]</span></sup> The murder rate in 2015 was 4.9 per 100,000 people.<sup><span>[479]</span></sup> In 2016 the murder rate increased by 8.6%, with 17,413 murders that year.<sup><span>[480]</span></sup> The national <span>clearance rate</span> for homicides in 2015 was 64.1%, compared to 90% in 1965.<sup><span>[481]</span></sup> In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980. In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of <span>violent crime</span> and particularly high levels of <span>gun violence</span> compared to other developed nations.<sup><span>[483]</span></sup> A cross-sectional analysis of the <span>World Health Organization</span> Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States \"homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.\"<sup><span>[484]</span></sup><span>Gun ownership rights</span> continue to be the subject of <span>contentious political debate</span>. In 2016, the US murder rate of 5.4 per 100,000 was similar to the estimated global average of 5.15 per 100,000.<sup><span>[485]</span></sup></p>\n <p>In 2017, there were 17,264 murders and the murder rate was 5.3 per 100,000. Regarding weapons, 73% of murders were committed by firearm, 10% by knife and 17% by other means.<sup><span>[486]</span></sup> The violent crime rose sharply in the 1960s until the early 1990s and declined in the late 1990s and 2000s.<sup><span>[486]</span></sup> In 2014, the murder rate fell to the lowest level (4.5) since 1957 (4.0).<sup><span>[487]</span></sup> The violent crime rate increased by 5.9% between 2014 and 2017 and the murder rate by 20.5%. Of those arrested for serious violent crimes in 2017, 58.5% were white, 37.5% were black, 2.1% were American Indian or Alaska Native and 1.5% Asian. Ethnically, 23.5% were Hispanic and 76.5% were non-Hispanic.<sup><span>[488]</span></sup> Gun violence peaked in 1993 with 17,125 gun murders before declining to 9,527 in 1999 and steadily rising since to 12,772. Non-gun murders reached a peak in 1980 of 8,340 and declined in most years until the early 2010s with 4,668 in 2017.<sup><span>[489]</span></sup> The rate of robberies declined 62% between 1990 and 2017.<sup><span>[486]</span></sup></p>\n <p>From 1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of homicide victims and 90% of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites (\"whites\" includes most Hispanics), and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims killed by whites.<sup><span>[490]</span></sup> In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.<sup><span>[491]</span></sup> The FBI's <span>Uniform Crime Reports</span> estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes.</p>\n <p><span>Capital punishment</span> is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and also at the state level in 30 states.<sup><span>[493]</span></sup><sup><span>[494]</span></sup> No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a <span>U.S. Supreme Court ruling</span> striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976 the Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and <span>Oklahoma</span>.<sup><span>[495]</span></sup> Meanwhile, <span>several states</span> have either abolished or struck down death-penalty laws.

In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by <span>NPR</span> (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the <span>Public Broadcasting Act of 1967</span>; its television counterpart, <span>PBS</span>, was also created by the same legislation (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other).

With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as <span>Gannett</span> or <span>McClatchy</span>, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have \"alternative weeklies\" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's <i><span>The Village Voice</span></i> or Los Angeles' <i><span>LA Weekly</span></i>, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.

</p>\n <p><span>一萬五千多年前</span>,<span>古印第安人</span>自<span>亞洲</span>遷徙至北美大陸。16世紀歐洲開始<span>殖民北美</span>。現今的合眾國起始於<span>東海岸</span>的<span>13個英屬美洲殖民地</span>。歐洲<span>七年戰爭</span>後,<span>大不列顛王國</span>與其殖民地之間的爭議愈發劇烈,最終導致在1775年爆發<span>美國革命</span>。1776年7月4日,正與大不列顛進行<span>獨立戰爭</span>的各殖民地派出代表,協同一致發表《<span>獨立宣言</span>》。戰爭終止於1783年,大不列顛王國承認這13個北美殖民地脫離管轄而獨立,與其簽訂《<span>巴黎條約</span>》。這場戰爭也是第一場成功脫離歐洲<span>殖民帝國</span>的獨立戰爭。1781年,《<span>邦聯條例</span>》在邦聯13個構成州獲得通過,共同組成了邦聯議會。1787年《<span>美利堅合眾國憲法</span>》完稿,將「美利堅合眾國」改制為聯邦體制,聯邦政府隨之成立。1791年,合稱為<span>權利法案</span>的十條<span>憲法修正案</span>獲得批准,擔保了基本民權。

Lusitania</span>),造成許多美國平民的無辜死傷,激怒美國民眾<sup><span>[69]</span></sup>。在戰爭最後階段,美國在1917年加入<span>協約國</span>以對抗<span>同盟國</span>。由於歷史原因,美國大眾對於<span>英國</span>和<span>法國</span>較為同情,雖然有部分<span>德裔</span>和<span>愛爾蘭裔</span>反對介入<sup><span>[70]</span></sup>。為了保護美國投資者和聯邦政府在歐洲的大量投資也是美國參戰的主因之一。在美國於1917年參戰後,對戰局有所扭轉,使協約國在1918年獲勝。戰後,擔心過度捲入歐洲事務,美國參議院並未批准協約國制裁同盟國的<span>凡爾賽條約</span><sup><span>[71]</span></sup>;相反,美國採取孤立主義政策。 </p>\n <p>戰爭使英法德等國家元氣大傷。而由於戰爭從未在美洲本土進行,給美國帶來大量財富和聲望。在幾乎整個1920年代,農產品價格不斷降低,工業利潤大幅增長,美國經濟發展的異常繁榮。另外信貸上升和<span>股票市場</span>的興盛也在這波經濟成長中起到推波助瀾的作用,終於令股市在1929年大崩盤,隨之而來的是<span>經濟大恐慌</span>。經濟大恐慌最終終結了共和黨數十年主導美國政治的地位,民主黨的<span>富蘭克林·德拉諾·羅斯福</span>上台執政。 </p>\n <p>為了復甦經濟,<span>富蘭克林·德拉諾·羅斯福</span>政府實行<span>新政</span>,大幅增加聯邦政府對市場經濟的干預,然而,美國經濟直到<span>第二次世界大戰</span>後才徹底復甦<sup><span>[73]</span></sup>。 </p>\n

</p>\n <p>總統每四年選舉一次,每個人最多只能任兩屆。雖然總統和副總統選舉是由全民普選方式舉行,不過產生方式則由選舉人票(選舉人由民選產生)所決定——除了<span>緬因</span>和<span>內布拉斯加</span>兩個州按普選票得票比例分配選舉人票外,其餘48個州和華盛頓特區均實行「勝者全得」制度,即把本州的選舉人票全部給予在該州獲得相對多數普選票的總統候選人,全國選舉人票為538張,候選人至少須獲得270票才能當選,數目等同國會議員總和及三張<span>華盛頓特區</span>的選舉人票。<span>選舉人團</span>所謂「<span>間接選舉</span>」只是禮儀性的程序,當選的選舉人在選舉人團投票時必須把票投給在該州獲勝的總統候選人,因此大選結果通常在大選投票日當天便可根據各州選舉結果算出。美國人口最多的<span>加利福尼亞州</span>所擁有的選舉人票多達55張,其次為<span>德薩斯州</span>的38張,而人口較少的<span>阿拉斯加州</span>等7州則只有3張選舉人票。鑑於這種情況,在歷屆美國總統選舉中,人口眾多的州都成為總統候選人爭奪的重要目標。美國歷史上曾數次發生這種情形,一些總統候選人雖然在大選中獲得的選民票少於對手,卻因得到足夠的選舉人票而當選。但是,這並不意味着少數選擧人可以操控選舉;相反,選擧人把票投給誰,還是要依靠普選的結果,只是因爲當初在設計的時候未能考慮到這種制度所隱藏的缺陷(由於當時美國通訊不發達,為防止民粹主義影響美國,故設立此機構)而導致普選票少於對方但仍舊當上總統的情況(不忠選舉人)。

</p>\n <p>一般而言,州內事務的主導權完全在各州政府手中。這包括內部通訊;關於財產、工業、商業以及公共設施的法規;州的相關法律,諸如死刑;以及州內部的工作情況。很多州立的法律在各州之間都十分相似。在還有一些領域中州的管轄權與聯邦政府的管轄權是重疊的。 </p>\n <p>最近幾年,聯邦政府在醫療、教育、福利、交通、住宅以及城市發展等領域開始扮演越來越重要的角色。各州的憲法與聯邦憲法基本相符,除了在一些細節上有所不同,其中包括人權和政府組織。而在商業、金融、公共服務和福利機構等方面,州憲法往往比聯邦憲法更為詳細。 </p>\n <h3>

<p>美國聯邦和州的政府與議會主要有兩個政黨競爭:<span>共和黨</span>和<span>民主黨</span>。一些小黨的參選人有時也有可能當選。 </p>\n <p>共和黨通常在社會議題上屬於社會<span>保守派</span>、在經濟議題上屬於<span>古典自由主義</span>,對外奉行強硬的國防外交政策,屬於干涉主義路線。 </p>\n <p>民主黨通常在社會議題上屬於<span>自由派</span>、在經濟議題上屬於<span>進步主義</span>及<span>自由主義</span>的路線。 </p>\n <p>美國人一般會傾向支持兩黨中的其中一個,不過一些人也會支持獨立的小政黨的候選人,包括<span>自由黨</span>、<span>綠黨</span>、<span>憲法黨</span>等。<sup><span>[111]</span></sup></p>\n <p>1933年-1995年,民主黨一直控制國會兩院,共和黨僅在1947年-1949年和1953年-1955年兩屆會期短暫取得多數。 </p>\n <p>1994年<span>共和黨革命</span>後,除了2001-2002年民主黨在參議院暫時佔多數外,共和黨控制國會兩院並保持在兩院的多數優勢直到2007年1月,2010年11月期中選舉中,共和黨重新奪回眾議院的多數,控制眾議院。 </p>\n <p>在總統選舉方面,自1860年林肯總統當選以來,共和黨一直保持總統職位(四屆除外)直至1932年羅斯褔當選總統。1952年民主黨結束其在白宮20年的執政地位。此後共和黨多能保持總統職位,而民主黨則控制國會。 </p>\n <p>2008年11月4日民主黨候選人<span>貝拉克·奧巴馬</span>當選第44屆<span>美國總統</span>,於2009年1月20日就任,成為美國史上首任<span>非裔美國人</span>總統。 </p>\n <p>2016年11月9日,共和黨當勞·特朗普當選第45任美國總統,成為美國歷史上首位政治素人總統。 </p>\n <h2 no-attr=empty>

</p>\n <p>美國也佔有其他土地、地區和佔領區。最特別的是美國首都<span>華盛頓哥倫比亞特區</span>,其本身並沒有州的地位,在國會亦無代表,但在總統選舉有3張選舉人票。其他的海外島嶼領土包括<span>美屬薩摩亞</span>、<span>關島</span>、<span>北馬利安納群島</span>、<span>波多黎各</span>、和<span>美屬維爾京群島</span>等。<span>帕邁拉環礁</span>是美國唯一的合併非建制領土,但目前並無人居住。<span>美國本土外小島嶼</span>則由<span>加勒比海</span>和太平洋的許多無人居住的島嶼組成。此外,自1898年始,美國在<span>古巴</span>的<span>關塔那摩灣</span>擁有一個規模龐大的海軍基地。 </p>\n <p>之前由美國佔領的地區包括<span>巴拿馬運河</span>區域,自1903年至1979年一直屬於美國領土。另外,<span>菲律賓群島</span>從1898年至1946年間也屬於美國領土,1935年美國在那裏建立了<span>菲律賓自治邦</span>作為轉型至完全獨立的國家前的過渡形式,最後在1946年菲律賓正式獨立,但美國仍在那裏保留軍事基地,美國和菲律賓不論在軍事、文化和經濟上關係依然密切。 </p>\n <p>除了美國的實際州和領土外,有數個國家自願加入為美國的聯合邦(Associated

</p>\n <p>從1980年代<span>朗奴·列根</span>的總統任期以來,美國增加了對<span>新自由主義</span>經濟政策的運用,相對減少了政府對經濟的干預、並減少福利制度的規模,拋棄了自經濟大恐慌以來長期實行的、偏向干涉主義的<span>凱恩斯主義</span>經濟政策。也因此,美國政府在社會福利方面提供的服務比其他工業化國家都要少,降低國內的稅賦,並更依賴於<span>自由市場</span>和私營的慈善機構上。縱使新自由主義所帶來的經濟寬鬆為工業的發展帶來了好處,由這種經濟制度衍生的<span>財團</span><span>壟斷</span>問題,不平等競爭問題,以及最低薪資問題都一再成為社會的爭議焦點,往往是國會選舉與總統大選時期的爭議話題之一。 </p>\n <p>1990年代,<span>電腦</span>及<span>互聯網</span>的普及令美國進入前所未有的繁榮及全球科技的領先地位。21世紀初,互聯網經濟泡沫破滅,導致美國經濟從高速增長陷入持久低速增長。雖然美國經濟在2003年後恢復較好的成長局面,但於2007年又爆發<span>次級房貸風暴</span>,令美國及整個世界經濟受到嚴重打擊,且美國金融與經濟的威信一落千丈,並且以<span>美元</span>計算國際黃金和原油的地位也被拿出來討論,隨後到2008年,美國次級房貸風暴演變成金融危機席捲全球,導致<span>金融海嘯</span>波及各國經濟,令全球的金融業、房地產、汽車業、奢侈品、與民間實質消費的成長嚴重下跌,尤其是英美為首的發達國家。目前已經逐漸進入後金融海嘯時代,經濟的模式與未來的重新檢討與改革正逐漸明朗,但不確定性相當高(大量印製鈔票),儘管如此,但美國經濟的份量仍是相當的高。

<p>美國是世界第二大農業國,足見其具備農業生產的大多優良條件:世界第四大河密西西比河縱貫南北,平原面積佔國土面積的近一半,耕地面積佔世界的十分之一;緯度適中,國土遼闊,氣候類型齊全;三面臨海(西臨太平洋、東臨大西洋、南臨墨西哥灣),並有多處太平洋島嶼的漁場,北方有五大湖,南方多降雨,西部有高山雪水,充足的水資源可供灌溉與魚蝦養殖;經濟發達,農業生產技術先進;交通發達;農作物品種優良等。美國的小麥、大豆、玉米、棉花、煙草、肉蛋奶產量均名列前茅,其中小麥產量佔世界的近十分之一;大豆和玉米均佔40%左右,畜牧業極盛,而且大量可供人類食用的糧食在美國是作為牲畜飼料使用的,儘管是人均消耗肉類與浪費食物最多的國家,但因為產量極為驚人,剩餘的糧食出口和外銷依舊達到世界第一之譜。但值得注意的是美國本土並沒有熱帶分佈,因而需要大量進口可可、咖啡、天然橡膠、香蕉等熱帶作物,美國產熱帶水果可以透過電腦控制環境的<span>溫室</span>栽培,美國國內超過一半的水果都在科技發達的<span>加利福尼亞州</span>產出。此外不單只看務農的經濟收入,由於高度機械與科技化,如果將諸如農機、冷凍、裝銷、生物科技、環境工程等附屬產業加疊起來,實際上可形成相當可觀的數字,例如在美國的<span>孟山都</span>公司雖然是化學工廠,但也涉及醫藥領域,甚至同時經營氣象等業務,這種分工精密而先驅的生產體系遍佈各產業,讓產值得以變得極高,生產成本又不斷下探,這種「西裝革履的牧人」、「實驗室的農夫」乃是美國公事包農業的特色。

<p>美國建國前的英國殖民地時期,沒有宗教自由,當時存在非常嚴酷的宗教法令,對不信仰基督新教的人進行歧視、迫害,主要針對<span>天主教徒</span>(部分基於反教權主義)而且基督宗教各派別控制的地區對其它派別的教徒也實行歧視政策。 </p>\n <p>美國建國後,<span>美國憲法第一修正案</span>於1791年通過,禁止<span>美國國會</span>立法設立<span>國教</span>,美國成為首個明文保障<span>宗教自由</span>權利的國家,<span>美國聯邦政府</span>實行<span>政教分離</span>制度,不能支持也不能反對任何一種宗教。但正是因為保障宗教自由發展,基督教的勢力自建國後開始在美國蓬勃發展,並在美國政治選舉中有相當的影響力,除<span>約翰·甘迺迪</span>為天主教徒外,歷屆<span>美國總統</span>都是<span>基督新教</span>信徒。 </p>\n <p>2007年的官方估計數字<sup><span>[133]</span></sup>: </p>\n <p>在所有發達國家中,美國是宗教氣氛最濃厚的一個國家。不過<span>美國各州</span>分佈的情況很不相同。美國虔誠保守的基督徒多分佈於南部和中西部各州,多是共和黨的支持者,南部黑人區、東北部和西部沿海各州的基督徒也多持開明態度,多是民主黨的支持者。 </p>\n <p>南方州中,<span>美南浸信會</span>是最大的教派,其後是<span>衛理公會</span>;而在東北<span>紐英倫</span>地區和南部接近<span>墨西哥</span>的邊境地帶中,天主教是佔主導地位,因為當地的人口很多都是歐洲天主教地區(如<span>德國</span>南部<span>巴伐利亞</span>、<span>愛爾蘭</span>、<span>意大利</span>和<span>波蘭</span>)移民的後裔,或者是北美洲其他地方(如<span>魁北克</span>和<span>波多黎各</span>)移民的後裔,南部則主要是來自墨西哥的拉美裔移民。美國其他的大部分地區的基督教人口則都是多種教派混合在一起。儘管大多數美國基督徒信奉<span>新教</span>,但因為新教徒往往屬於各個不同的教派,因此<span>天主教會</span>擁有最多的成員,而天主教徒隨着更多的拉美裔移民增加而有所增加,而他們的高生育率亦有助增加美國的基督徒數量,特別是天主教會。<span>摩門教</span>的勢力也不容小覷。

</p>\n <p>美國的居民家庭收入水平較高,但各州之間也存在着顯著差距,比如<span>西維珍尼亞州</span>的中間家庭收入為3.3萬美元,而<span>新罕布什爾州</span>則高達5.7萬美元<sup><span>[137]</span></sup><sup><span>[138]</span></sup>,一般則都介於<span>英國</span>(45575美元)<sup><span>[139]</span></sup>和<span>新西蘭</span>(30256美元)兩者之間<sup><span>[140]</span></sup>。 </p>\n <p>中等收入群的長期工資趨勢自1970年代一直陷入停滯,而低收入者的總體收入在下降,雖然時均勞動生產率業已大幅提高。美國各州最低工資標準普遍在時薪7-8美元左右,大約只有西歐以及<span>澳洲</span>標準的一半。<sup><span>[141]</span></sup><span>非法移民</span>所得的低工資使之成為最貧困的10%勞動力,<sup><span>[143]</span></sup>然而肉類包裝業和農業之類的產業大量依賴於非法勞工。<sup><span>[144]</span></sup>在2005年的一份來自美國勞工部的報告中說,自1960年代以來,工資佔國民GDP的比例之低和企業盈利水平之高同時創了歷史紀錄<sup><span>[145]</span></sup>。 </p>\n <p><span>女權主義</span>運動帶來了美國和歐洲女性就業率的大幅度上升。1950年代美國婚後女性就業率僅為11%,甚至少於1920年代。<sup><span>[146]</span></sup>經歷了在1960年代、1970年代伴隨着帶有濃烈地<span>左翼</span>色彩的<span>民權運動</span>而出現的的女權運動高潮後,1978年美國已婚女性就業率上升到50%。1997年達到61%,在1990年到21世紀初的頭幾年的經濟繁榮期時,認同「返回家庭相夫教子」的「選擇女權主義」逐漸回潮,<sup><span>[147]</span></sup>已婚女性就業率曾經回落到54%,<sup><span>[148]</span></sup>在2008年底<span>世界金融危機</span>爆發後,因為生活壓力增大所迫,美國已婚女性就業率重新上揚<sup><span>[149]</span></sup>,只是性別收入並不平等,女性薪水一直低於男性,男性從業者的工作傷害也更多。而此現象僅非洲裔除外,原因是因為黑人青年衝動未婚生子或父親坐牢因素,單親媽媽需要養孩子而必須工作的比例較高。

<p>與其他<span>西方</span>國家不同,美國保健制度不是完全公費,而是公私共同支付,美國並無全民健保,美國總統<span>克林頓</span>任內其妻希拉里曾花費許多心力想建立全民健保,讓美國人人有醫療保險,然而卻被國會與利益團體否決掉。據2004年資料,個人健康花費中私營保險業支付佔36%,個人佔15%,聯邦、州和地方政府佔44%。<sup><span>[157]</span></sup>在2005年,4120萬居民(美國總人口的14.2%)至少在該年度的某一段時間沒有醫療保險;不過其中三分之一家庭收入超過5萬美元,而這類人口又有一半人收入超過7.5萬美元。<sup><span>[158]</span></sup>另外,夠資格加入公費醫療保險的人有三分之一未加入。醫療保險在美國傳統上屬於僱員福利。同時,無論病人是否有能力支付費用,醫院必須提供急診服務,然而急診之後醫院可趕走付不出錢的病人。在美國,醫藥費是導致個人破產的最大因素。<sup><span>[159]</span></sup>美國在醫療研究投入了巨額資金,大多數為私人投資。據2000年統計,私營非盈利機構投入佔7%,私營企業佔57%,稅金支持的<span>國立衛生研究院</span>佔36%。<sup><span>[160]</span></sup></p>\n

<p><span>美國人</span>的飲食習慣常是一日三餐。早餐時間大約在早上7點到8點。早餐內容各地自有差別。一頓簡單的早飯,可能為<span>果汁</span>、<span>牛奶</span>、<span>麥片</span>、烤<span>麵包</span>以及<span>咖啡</span>等簡便食品。早餐通常在家裏用餐,不過也有時候借早餐的機會來討論業務等商業活動,稱為「工作早餐」。午餐的時間基本在中午12點至下午2點。因為時間短且人們離家不見得近,所以學生與上班族很少回家吃飯,而是從家裏帶餐點來,故相比較而言美國人的午餐是三餐中最簡單的,生<span>蔬菜</span><span>沙律</span>、<span>三明治</span>、<span>漢堡</span>或<span>餡餅</span>、<span>熱狗</span>等,再來一杯<span>飲料</span>。晚餐在傍晚6點至7點左右開始,一般都比較豐富,所以在<span>美式英語</span>中<span>晚餐</span>也有正餐、大餐的意思。在晚餐時一般都會先來一份<span>果汁</span>或是<span>濃湯</span>,然後再上主菜。常擺在餐桌上的主菜有<span>牛排</span>、<span>豬排</span>、烤<span>牛腩</span>、<span>炸雞</span>、<span>炸蝦</span>、<span>火腿</span>和烤<span>羊排</span>等。多數的美國人喜歡在享用完晚飯後再來一些甜食,比如<span>蛋糕</span>、<span>雪糕</span>和<span>巧克力</span>。在周末或假日,許多家庭只吃兩頓飯。他們把早飯和午飯和在一起吃叫做<span>早午餐</span>,由<span>早餐</span>和<span>午餐</span>相加而得。一般比較正式。有的家庭星期天不做飯,全家去<span>餐館</span>用餐。在一些<span>美國節日</span>,美國家庭也時常舉行<span>野餐</span>和<span>戶外</span><span>烤肉</span>。

<span>外交史</span><span><span>[</span><span>編輯</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div role=note>參見:<span>美國外交</span> </div>\n <p><span>美國革命</span>期間,美國與一些歐洲國家建立了外交關係,說服了法國、西班牙以及荷蘭協助對抗英國。在接下來的開墾年代裏,美國一直在親法或親英兩個選擇間搖擺不定。當時美國對歐洲事務不願插手,專注於北美的疆土開拓。 </p>\n <p>後來美國以<span>門羅主義</span>削弱了歐洲在拉丁美洲的影響力,以確保自己在美洲地區事務的支配權。美國的<span>擴張政策</span>陸續引發了與<span>墨西哥</span>和<span>西班牙</span>的戰爭,兩戰均以美國的勝利告終。在<span>南北戰爭</span>中,美國指責英國和法國支援南部分裂的<span>美利堅聯盟國</span>,並試圖入侵墨西哥。但在內戰結束後,美國在北美洲的主導地位就再未受過挑戰。 </p>\n <p>隨着國力漸增,美國開始將注意力轉向海外,尤其是對外貿易的開拓。為此,美國佔領了太平洋的許多領土,包括<span>夏威夷</span>、<span>菲律賓</span>,並與歐洲列強競爭在<span>中國</span>的影響力。第二次世界大戰後,美國在<span>聯合國</span>的創建上扮演了重要角色,並且成為<span>安全理事會</span>的五名永久會員之一。 </p>\n <p><span>冷戰</span>期間,美國最初試圖限制<span>蘇聯</span>於世界各地的影響力。為了對抗蘇聯,美國、加拿大和10個歐洲國家共同建立了<span>北大西洋公約組織</span>,以聯合盟國對抗任何針對北美和歐洲的軍事行動,後來又有14個歐洲國家陸續加入了這一共同防禦聯盟,包括<span>土耳其</span>和一些前<span>華沙條約</span>成員國以及部分前蘇聯加盟共和國。出於政治上的現實考量,美國也與<span>共産主義</span>陣營中部分社會主義國家結成戰略夥伴,例如<span>中蘇交惡</span>後的<span>中華人民共和國</span>。 </p>\n <p>近年來,由於<span>蘇聯解體</span>,美國失去全球戰略對手,更加關注自身邊界安全,防止<span>非法移民</span>和非法<span>毒品</span>進入國內——尤其是針對<span>墨西哥</span>和<span>加勒比海國家</span>。<sup><span>[187]</span></sup>美國也充分利用冷戰後的全球領導地位,基於國家利益和民主自由價值觀,打擊<span>恐怖主義</span>、<span>邪惡軸心</span>國家和避免<span>大規模殺傷性武器</span>的擴散,其主要目標為維護國家利益,被認為有<span>干涉主義</span>的性質。近年由於中國在經濟和軍事上迅速發展,美國逐漸加強在亞洲的軍事部署。

</p>\n <p>目前世界上只有<span>朝鮮</span>、<span>伊朗</span>、<span>敘利亞</span>和<span>不丹</span>四國未與美國建立外交關係。2015年時任美國總統奧巴馬訪問古巴後,古巴與美國恢復兩國中斷超過50年的外交關係,同時美國也是世界上少數不承認朝鮮的國家之一。 </p>\n <p>但在<span>中東</span>及<span>伊斯蘭</span>社會冷戰後的美國外交一直不被看好,甚至常年被媒體評論為失敗,從<span>巴以問題</span>一直僵持不下,又<span>911事件</span>開始再到<span>阿富汗戰爭</span>、<span>伊拉克戰爭</span>的<span>戰爭泥潭</span>,<span>阿拉伯之春</span>變成<span>阿拉伯之冬</span>,經歷動盪的<span>利比亞</span>和<span>敘利亞</span>乃至<span>埃及</span>、<span>黎巴嫩</span>至今局勢還沒有穩定下來,這導致了中東地區的20多個國家的<span>反美</span>浪潮愈演愈烈。而美國的外交政策也實在讓人難以捉摸。據有關信息指出,美國政府在明知恐怖組織的威脅性下,仍然放手不管,導致了如今ISIS對中東威脅的加重。<sup><span>[189]</span></sup><sup><span>[190]</span></sup></p>\n

</p>\n <p>美軍的軍事實力也表現在<span>物流管理</span>和電戰能力上,在這方面的龐大優勢使美軍能夠迅速集結部隊應付戰爭。美國空軍有<span>C-5</span>、<span>C-17</span>等巨型空運載具,並裝備先進的<span>F-22猛禽戰鬥機</span>及<span>F-35閃電II戰鬥機</span>。美國海軍有11艘現役大型<span>航空母艦</span>,配合軍事力量投射的原則,使美軍能對大部分的威脅做出迅速反應。美國在1949年4月4日加入地區性軍事防衛組織<span>北大西洋公約組織</span>,也使美國本土有了一層除美軍外的軍事保護屏障。

</p>\n <p>總體上説,美國文化最顯著的影響來自西歐,特別是<span>德意志</span>、<span>英格蘭</span>和<span>愛爾蘭</span><sup><span>[191]</span></sup>,以及後來的<span>意大利</span>、<span>希臘</span>、和<span>中歐猶太人</span>的文化影響。原為奴隸的非裔美國人也保存了一些自<span>西非</span>帶來的文化。美國的地理名稱往往反映了英格蘭、荷蘭、法國、西班牙、和美國原住民等等的綜合歷史成分。 </p>\n <p>一個描述美國文化的模型是「<span>大熔爐</span>」:移民帶來自己的文化貢獻,溶入美國文化之中,最終形成一個統一的美國文化。最近常用的模型是「<span>色拉碗</span>」:移民帶來的文化會保持一些自己獨立的文化特徵,而非完全融入原有的美國文化,他們所帶來的文化也會成為美國文化的一部分。現代社會學家對美國文化的目標的認同趨向於多元文化論,而非熔爐,很大程度上放棄了熔爐觀念<sup><span>[193]</span></sup>。 </p>\n <p>20世紀之前的美國文化從模仿歐洲(尤其是英國)逐漸發展到擁有自己的特色,二戰後隨美國經濟軍事政治實力的飛躍,它的文化對全世界、特別是歐洲產生了重大的影響。時至今日,美國流行音樂響徹全球,美國電影和電視則在全球播放。 </p>\n <p>針對美國文化這種客觀上「入侵」全球的現象,批評聲不絕於耳。很多歐洲人認為美國文化天真幼稚,特別是以<span>法國</span>、<span>俄羅斯</span>等為首的國家對美國文化的進入一直堅決抵制。而東亞、東南亞、南亞和中東地區的文化傳統與美國又大不相同,出現反差不一,深受其影響的有前殖民地<span>菲律賓</span>,以及二戰後的<span>日本</span>、<span>韓國</span>、<span>新加坡</span>等美國盟國,另一方面部分亞洲的<span>伊斯蘭國家</span>則對其有很強的抵觸情緒。同時很多加拿大人和澳洲人也對美國文化的同化影響十分擔憂。美國文化的全球地位極大程度上促進了<span>英語</span>的傳播,使其成為世界上的公認「世界語」,<span>法國</span>則有意在自己能夠影響到的範圍內全力抗擊英語文化的影響,以保存在<span>非洲</span>公用的<span>法語</span>優勢。

<p>美國音樂的歷史可以追溯至早期美國原住民的傳統宗教音樂,隨着大量歐洲國家移民的到來,替美國音樂增添了<span>基督教合唱</span>、音樂樂譜的色彩。之後的每波移民潮都帶來了不同地區、不同文化和特色的音樂。大量的非裔美國人也帶來了具有非洲特色的傳統音樂,19世紀後期開始浮現的美國流行音樂很大一部分都是源自這些非裔美國人的<span>布魯斯</span>,以及1920年代開始發展的<span>福音音樂</span>。非裔美國人音樂成為了美國流行音樂的根基,混合了歐洲與土著的音樂成分。美國也有大量的<span>民間音樂</span>以及來自烏克蘭、愛爾蘭、蘇格蘭、波蘭、墨西哥和猶太人等移民的音樂。許多美國城市和鄉鎮也都發展出獨立的地區音樂。底特律、紐約、芝加哥、洛杉磯等大城市以及數不盡的小城市都發展出自己的音樂風格。

<p>在最早的殖民時期,美國文學主要的題材是讚揚新大陸替殖民者和歐洲母國所帶來的利益。宗教信仰上的爭議也是題材之一。隨着革命戰爭的爆發和美國的獨立,<span>本傑明·富蘭克林</span>和<span>托馬斯·潘恩</span>等人寫下的政治著作在文學和政治上都有極大影響,也催生了新國家的獨立意識。寫下了<span>獨立宣言</span>並在後來成為美國總統的<span>托瑪斯·傑弗遜</span>也被認為是美國早期最具天份的作家之一。隨着<span>1812年戰爭</span>和對於獨立文學特色的渴望,更多新的、具有美國特色的作家如<span>愛倫·坡</span>等人逐漸嶄露頭角。奴隸制度的衝突和接踵而來的內戰也對美國文學有深刻影響,到了19世紀末,由於工業化的進展和國土開拓時期的結束,美國文學脫離了原先的邊境文學,<span>馬克·吐溫</span>成為第一個不在東海岸出生的主要作家,開啟美國本土文學之先河。英國作家<span>毛姆</span>認為<span>梅爾維爾</span>的《<span>白鯨記</span>》是世界十大文學名著之一,地位更在馬克吐溫等人之上。

<p><span>運動</span>是美國全國性的休閒活動,其受歡迎的程度是其他休閒活動都無法相比的。職業運動在美國是商機極大的領域,選擇成為職業運動員的人也獲得極高的報酬。世界上收入最高的運動團隊和運動員絕大多數都是在美國<sup><span>[196]</span></sup>。被稱為「四巨頭」的運動領域包括了<span>棒球</span>、<span>美式足球</span>、<span>冰上曲棍球</span>和<span>籃球</span>。其他受歡迎的運動還包括<span>賽車</span>以及被視為美國最古老的運動、源自於美洲原住民的<span>袋棍球</span>。 </p>\n <p>美國有着成熟的職業體育聯盟,例如<span>國家橄欖球聯盟</span>(NFL)、<span>美國職棒大聯盟</span>(MLB)、<span>國家籃球協會</span>(NBA)和<span>國家冰球聯盟</span>(NHL)等。 </p>\n <p>美國也是發展<span>高爾夫球</span>和<span>網球</span>等運動的主要國家。美國同時亦是西方國家裏<span>拳擊</span>和<span>職業摔角</span>的發展中心,比賽往往吸引大量群眾觀戰,同時也吸引各種運動賭博的活動,美國也產出了許多世界知名的拳擊冠軍。其他的格鬥運動,例如源自日本的<span>空手道</span>,在美國也相當受歡迎,並且經常進行比賽。 </p>\n <p>美國也有許多源自歐洲、並在美國廣泛發展的運動,例如<span>賽馬</span>。<span>英式橄欖球</span>也相當受到歡迎。其他的歐洲運動如<span>馬球</span>和<span>板球</span>雖然並不普及,但也有不少死忠的觀眾。 </p>\n <p>雖然<span>英式足球</span>是全球範圍最受歡迎的運動,但足球在美國相較其他國家而言普及度並不高,它是國內特別是拉丁美洲,意大利裔以及西班牙裔社區最受歡迎的運動。然而進入2000年代後,越來越多的美國白人青少年選擇足球作為他們的首選運動,根據<span>國務院國情諮詢局</span>在2004年的一份調查,在美國有近1600萬人口經常選擇踢足球,而自1987年至2006年,足球亦是唯一一個參與人數取得淨增長的運動<sup><span>[197]</span></sup>,越來越多的城市成立俱樂部加入到影響力日益擴大的<span>MLS</span>(美國職業足球聯盟)中;<span>美國國家足球隊</span>在近幾屆<span>世界盃足球賽</span>中亦取得了不俗的戰績,在<span>2002年韓日世界盃</span>賽中打入八強,<span>2010年南非世界盃</span>賽中亦打進複賽。 </p>\n <p>大學體育運動在美國也相當普及,受歡迎程度幾乎與職業領域不相上下,尤其是在<span>美式足球</span>和籃球領域。許多大學和學院都培養了運動團隊,定期舉行校際間的競賽。大學和學院所培養的運動類型相當廣泛,從<span>田徑</span>運動到<span>水球</span>都包含在內。同樣的,美國的高中也有各式各樣的體育活動,有時候這些校際間的比賽還會成為當地的頭條新聞,顯示了美國人民對於運動的喜愛和重視。由於金融危機,美國不得不縮減用於體育方面的開支,致使在最近兩次奧運會美國金牌霸主地位受到挑戰。

<p>但少數人批評美國夢過度強調了物質財富在衡量勝利和快樂上扮演的角色。因為與其他大多數國家不同的是,在美國擁有的經濟自由相當多,政府扮演的角色相當有限,這使得美國的社會流動性極大。從美國獨立直至19世紀末期,廣大的土地都無人居住和擁有,任何有心人都可以加以佔據並投資和開墾。而到了<span>工業革命</span>時期,美國龐大的自然資源和先進的工業技術則使得快速的社會流動成為可能。<sup><span><span

Each state has its own <span>constitution</span>, grounded in <span>republican principles</span>, and government, consisting of three branches: <span>executive</span>, <span>legislative</span>, and <span>judicial</span>.<sup><span>[4]</span></sup> All states and their residents are represented in the federal <span>Congress</span>, a <span>bicameral</span> legislature consisting of the <span>Senate</span> and the <span>House of Representatives</span>. Each state is represented by two senators, while representatives are <span>distributed</span> among the states in proportion to the most recent <span>constitutionally</span> mandated decennial <span>census</span>.<sup><span>[5]</span></sup> Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the <span>Electoral College</span>, the body that elects the <span>president of the United States</span>, equal to the total of representatives and senators in Congress from that state.<sup><span>[6]</span></sup><span>Article IV</span>, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to <span>admit</span> new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from <span>the original 13</span> to the current total of 50, and each new state is admitted on an <span>equal footing</span> with the existing states.<sup><span>[7]</span></sup></p>\n <p>As provided by <span>Article I</span>, <span>Section 8</span> of the Constitution, Congress exercises \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the federal district, which is not part of any state. Prior to passage of the 1973 <span>District of Columbia Home Rule Act</span>, which devolved certain Congressional powers to an elected <span>mayor</span> and <span>council</span>, the district did not have an elected local government. Even so, Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the council and intervene in local affairs.<sup><span>[8]</span></sup> As it is not a state, the district does not have <span>representation</span> in the Senate. However, since 1971, its residents have been represented in the House of Representatives by a non-voting <span>delegate</span>.<sup><span>[9]</span></sup> Additionally, since 1961, following ratification of the <span>23rd Amendment</span>, the district has been entitled to select three electors to vote in the Electoral College. </p>\n <p>In addition to the 50 states and federal district, the United States has <span>sovereignty</span> over 14 <span>territories</span>. Five of them (<span>American Samoa</span>, <span>Guam</span>, the <span>Northern Mariana Islands</span>, <span>Puerto Rico</span>, and the <span>U.S. Virgin Islands</span>) have a permanent, nonmilitary population, while nine of them do not. With the exception of <span>Navassa Island</span>, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are located in the <span>Caribbean</span>, all territories are located in the <span>Pacific Ocean</span>. One territory, <span>Palmyra Atoll</span>, is considered to be <span>incorporated</span>, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other territories are <span>unincorporated</span>, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be <span>unorganized</span>, meaning they have not had an <span>Organic Act</span> enacted by Congress; the four other territories are <span>organized</span>, meaning they have had an Organic Act that has been enacted by Congress. The five inhabited territories each have limited autonomy and a non-voting delegate in Congress, in addition to having territorial legislatures and governors, but residents cannot vote in federal elections. </p>\n <p><span>California</span> is the most populous state, with 38,332,521 residents (2013 estimate); <span>Wyoming</span> is the least populous, with an estimated 582,658 residents. The District of Columbia, with an estimated 646,449 residents as of 2012, has a higher population than the two least populous states (Wyoming and <span>Vermont</span>). The largest state by area is Alaska, encompassing 665,384 square miles (1,723,340 km<sup>2</sup>), while the smallest is <span>Rhode Island</span>, encompassing 1,545 square miles (4,000 km<sup>2</sup>). The first state to ratify the current Constitution was <span>Delaware</span>, which it did on December 7, 1787, while the newest state is Hawaii, which was admitted to the Union on August 21, 1959. The largest territory in terms of both population and size is Puerto Rico, with 3,725,789 residents as of the <span>2010 Census</span> and a total area of 5,325 square miles (13,790 km<sup>2</sup>).

On July 4, 1776, they issued the <span>Declaration of Independence</span>, which announced their independence from Great Britain and their creation of a cooperative union. The disobedient states defeated Great Britain in the <span>American Revolutionary War</span>, the first successful <span>colonial war of independence</span>.<sup><span>[10]</span></sup> The <span>Philadelphia Convention</span> adopted the current <span>United States Constitution</span> on September 17, 1787; its approval the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government. The <span>Bill of Rights</span>, making up ten <span>constitutional amendments</span> guaranteeing many basic civil rights and freedoms, was approved in 1791. </p>\n <p>In the 19th century, the United States received land from <span>France</span>, <span>Spain</span>, the <span>United Kingdom</span>, <span>Mexico</span>, and <span>Russia</span>, and <span>took over</span> the <span>Republic of Texas</span> and the <span>Republic of Hawaii</span>.

The North's victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the <span>end of legal slavery</span> in the United States. By the 1870s, the national wealth was the world's largest.<sup><span>[11]</span></sup> The <span>Spanish–American War</span> and <span>World War I</span> confirmed the country's status as a military power.

On June 14, 1775, the <span>Continental Congress</span>, meeting in <span>Philadelphia</span>, established a <span>Continental Army</span> under the command of <span>George Washington</span>. Announcing that \"<span>all men are created equal</span>\" and are born with \"certain <span>natural rights</span>,\" the Congress adopted the <span>Declaration of Independence</span>, drafted mostly by <span>Thomas Jefferson</span>, on July 4, 1776. That date is now celebrated every year as America's <span>Independence Day</span>. In 1777, the <span>Articles of Confederation</span> established a weak federal government that operated until 1789. </p>\n <p>After the <span>British defeat</span> by American forces <span>helped by the French</span>, Great Britain <span>recognized the independence of the United States</span> and the states' <span>sovereignty</span> over American land west to the <span>Mississippi River</span>. A <span>constitutional convention</span> was organized in 1787 by those wishing to establish a strong national government, with powers of taxation. The <span>United States Constitution</span> was approved in 1788, and the new republic's <span>first Senate, House of Representatives</span>, and <span>President</span>—George Washington—took office in 1789.

The <span>Louisiana Purchase</span> of French-claimed land under President Thomas Jefferson in 1803 almost doubled the nation's size. The <span>War of 1812</span>, declared against Britain over different complaints and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. <span>nationalism</span>. A series of U.S. military invasions into Florida led <span>Spain to give up</span> it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. The United States took over the <span>Republic of Texas</span> in 1845. The idea of <span>Manifest destiny</span> became popular during this time.<sup><span>[19]</span></sup> The 1846 <span>Oregon Treaty</span> with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day <span>American Northwest</span>. The U.S. victory in the <span>Mexican–American War</span> resulted in the 1848 <span>cession</span> of <span>California</span> and much of the present-day <span>American Southwest</span>. The <span>California Gold Rush</span> of 1848–49 further encouraged western relocation. New railways made relocation easier for settlers and increased conflicts with Native Americans. Over a half-century, up to 40 million <span>American bison</span>, or buffalo, were murdered for skins and meat and to ease the railways' spread. The loss of the buffalo, which were valuable to the <span>plains Indians</span>, caused many native cultures to become gone forever. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Civil War and industrialization</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div role=note>See also: <span>American Civil War</span>, <span>Reconstruction era</span>, and <span>Spanish–American War</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/_V2EmRKoDwvIbjyeZX-xaejklc2KDDujT5pghu5Zx9spmqVi64zKQ1Ib7zg=/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/KvBeU8hdkV0x82W3A_p_7Y1NeU52RFwxSkmyENvhR5iUoID8A1XqeFFtAng=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Battle_of_Gettysburg%2C_by_Currier_and_Ives.png/220px-Battle_of_Gettysburg%2C_by_Currier_and_Ives.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <i><span>Battle of Gettysburg</span></i>, lithograph by <span>Currier and Ives</span>, ca. 1863</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p><span>Tensions</span> between slave and <span>free states</span> mounted with arguments over the relationship between the <span>state and federal governments</span>, as well as <span>violent conflicts</span> over the spread of slavery into new states. <span>Abraham Lincoln</span>, a candidate of the mostly antislavery <span>Republican Party</span>, was elected president in 1860.

The wave of immigration, lasting until 1929, gave labor and changed American culture. High tax protections, national infrastructure building, and new banking laws encouraged growth also. The 1867 <span>Alaska Purchase</span> from Russia completed the country's mainland expansion. The <span>Wounded Knee Massacre</span> in 1890 was the last major armed conflict of the <span>Indian Wars</span>. In 1893, the <span>native monarchy</span> of the Pacific <span>Kingdom of Hawaii</span> was ended in a secret and successful plan led by American residents; the United States took over the archipelago in 1898.

The <span>federal government of the United States</span> is set up by the <span>Constitution</span>. There are three branches. They are the <i><span>executive branch</span></i>, the <i><span>legislative branch</span></i>, and the <i><span>judicial branch</span></i>. State governments and the federal government work in very similar ways. Each state has its own executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The executive branch of a state government is led by a <span>governor</span>, instead of a president. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Executive branch</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The <span>executive branch</span> is the part of the government that enforces the law. Members of the <span>U.S. Electoral College</span> elect a <span>president</span> who is the leader of the executive branch, as well as the leader of the <span>armed forces</span>. The president may <span>veto</span> a bill that the Congress has passed, so it does not become a law. The President may also make \"executive orders\" to ensure that people follow the law. </p>\n <p>The president is in charge of many departments that control much of the day-to-day actions of government. For example, <span>Department of Commerce</span> makes rules about trade. The president chooses the heads of these departments, and also nominates federal judges. However, the <span>Senate</span>, part of the legislative branch, must agree with all of the people the president chooses. The president may serve two 4-year terms. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Legislative branch</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/NYQ4FCyCnvS-EZGcuuC7JS26MIp_Q0UFP1NJ5fdkNcI5UlPuZ2eS-SJL--c=/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/IIU76w4-odVdKMcZ5AtvahkJT4zrzw08Z8ohyJ44ArqbmGdxLLK34hD27Xk=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/USCapitol.jpg/220px-USCapitol.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The west side of the <span>United States Capitol</span>, which is home to the <span>United States Congress</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The <span>legislative branch</span> makes laws. The legislative branch is called the <span>United States Congress</span>. Congress is divided into two \"houses\". </p>\n <p>One house is the <span>House of Representatives</span>. The Representatives are each elected by voters from a set area within a state. The number of Representatives a state has is based on how many people live there. Representatives serve two-year terms. The total number of representatives today is 435. The leader of the House of Representatives is the <span>Speaker of the House</span>. </p>\n <p>The other house is the <span>Senate</span>. In the Senate, each state is represented equally, by two senators. Because there are 50 states, there are 100 senators. The President's <span>treaties</span> or appointments of <span>officials</span> need the Senate's approval. Senators serve six-year terms. The Vice President of the United States serves as president of the Senate. In practice, the vice president is usually absent from the Senate, and a senator serves as president <span>pro tempore</span>, or <a href=https://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/temporary title=wikt:temporary rel=nofollow target=_blank>temporary</a> president, of the Senate. </p>\n <p>Representatives and senators <span>propose</span> laws, called \"<span>bills</span>\", in their respective houses. A bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group, known as a <span>committee</span>, which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house. If one house votes to pass a bill, the bill then gets sent to the other house; if both houses vote for it, it is then sent to the president, who may sign the bill into law or <span>veto</span> it. If the president vetoes the bill, it is sent back to Congress. If Congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two-thirds <span>majority</span>, the bill becomes law and cannot be vetoed by the president. </p>\n <p>Under the American system of <span>federalism</span>, Congress may not make laws that directly control the states; instead, Congress may use the promise of federal funds, or special circumstances such as national <span>emergencies</span>, to encourage the states to follow federal law. This system is both complex and unique. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Judicial branch</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <p>The <span>judicial branch</span> is the part of government that interprets what the law means. The Judicial Branch is made up of the <span>Supreme Court</span> and many lower courts. If the Supreme Court decides that a law is not allowed by <span>the Constitution</span>, the law is said to be \"struck down\" and is no longer a <span>valid</span> law. </p>\n <p>The Supreme Court is made up of nine <span>judges</span>, called justices, who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. One of these justices, called the <span>chief justice</span>, heads the court. A Supreme Court justice serves until he or she dies or <span>resigns</span> (quits in the middle of his or her term). When that happens, the president nominates someone new to replace the justice who left. If the Senate agrees with that choice, the person becomes a justice. If the Senate does not agree with the president's choice, then the president must nominate someone else. </p>\n <p>Famous court cases such as <i><span>Marbury v Madison</span></i> (which was decided in 1803) have firmly established that the Supreme Court is the <span>ultimate interpreter</span> of the <span>United States Constitution</span> and has the power to strike down any law that <span>conflicts</span> with it.<sup><span>[44]</span></sup></p>\n <h2> <span>Politics</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <div role=note>See also: <span>States of the United States</span> and <span>Politics of the United States</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/lm6oX-WQq8T6n412MkmyRa8A0WMcbwy-14SkO1BUnwXE4dK_xt9YEYKATHU=/wiki/United_States__-__/tunnel/XtQfFTCgsdPFG5Ri3MGKDaHRH2Dp16ZUnCRDQTRGmbIzPjryv7bM1mfU-fw=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Political_System_of_the_United_States.svg/220px-Political_System_of_the_United_States.svg.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The political system of the United States</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The United States of America consists of <span>50 states</span>, 5 territories and 1 district (<span>Washington D.C</span>.). States can make laws about things inside the state, but federal law is about things dealing with more than one state or dealing with other countries. In some areas, if the federal government makes laws that say different things from the state laws, people must follow the federal law because the state law is not a law any more. Each state has a constitution of its own, different from the federal (national) Constitution. Each of these is like the federal Constitution because they say how each state's government is set up, but some also talk about specific laws. </p>\n <p>The federal and most state governments are dominated by two <span>political parties</span>: the <span>Republicans</span> and the <span>Democrats</span>. There are many smaller parties; the largest of these are the <span>Libertarian Party</span> and the <span>Green Party</span>. People help in political <span>campaigns</span> that they like. They try to persuade politicians to help them; this is called <span>lobbying</span>. All Americans are allowed to do these things, but some have and spend more money than others, or in other ways do more in politics. Some people think this is a problem, and lobby for rules to be made to change it. </p>\n <p>Since 2017, the president is a Republican, and Congress is also Republican-controlled, so the Republicans have more power in the federal government. There are still many powerful Democrats who can try to stop the Republicans from doing things that they believe will be bad for the country. Also, members of a party in power do not always agree on what to do. If enough people decide to vote against Republicans in the next election, they will lose power. In a republic like the United States, no party can do whatever they want. All politicians have to argue, compromise, and make deals with each other to get things done. They have to answer to the people and take responsibility for their mistakes. </p>\n <p>The USA's large <span>cultural</span>, economic, and military influence has made the <span>foreign policy of the United States</span>, or relations with other countries, a topic in American politics, and the politics of many other countries. </p>\n <h2 no-attr=empty> <span>Political divisions</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <div role=note>Main articles: <span>U.S. state</span>, <span>Territorial evolution of the United States</span>, and <span>Territorial changes of the United States</span> </div>\n <h3> <span>States</span><span><span>[</span><span>change</span><span> | </span><span>change source</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div role=note>See also: <span>List of U.S. states</span> </div>\n <p>The United States <span>conquered</span> and <span>bought</span> new lands over time, and grew from the original 13 colonies in the east to the current 50 states, of which 48 of them are <span>joined together</span> to make up the <span>contiguous United States</span>.

entity</span>, of which there are currently 50. Bound together in a <span>political union</span>, each state holds <span>governmental</span> jurisdiction over a separate and defined geographic territory and shares its <span>sovereignty</span> with the <span>federal government</span>. Due to this shared sovereignty, <span>Americans</span> are <span>citizens</span> both of the <span>federal republic</span> and of the state in which they <span>reside</span>.<sup><span>[3]</span></sup> State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to <span>move between states</span>, except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders (e.g., <span>paroled</span> convicts and children of divorced spouses who are <span>sharing custody</span>). </p>\n <p>States are divided into <span>counties</span> or county-equivalents, which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state, and states may also create other <span>local governments</span>. <span>State governments</span> are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual <span>constitutions</span>. All are grounded in <span>republican principles</span>, and each provides for a government, consisting of three branches, each with <span>separate and independent powers</span>: <span>executive</span>, <span>legislative</span>, and <span>judicial</span>.<sup><span>[4]</span></sup></p>\n <p>States possess a number of powers and rights under the <span>United States Constitution</span>. States and their residents are represented in the <span>United States Congress</span>, a <span>bicameral</span> legislature consisting of the <span>Senate</span> and the <span>House of Representatives</span>. Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors (equal to the total number of representatives and senators from that state) to vote in the <span>Electoral College</span>, the body that directly elects the <span>President of the United States</span>. Additionally, each state has the opportunity to <span>ratify</span><span>constitutional amendments</span>, and, with the consent of Congress, two or more states may enter into <span>interstate compacts</span> with one another. </p>\n <p>Historically, the tasks of local <span>law enforcement</span>, <span>public education</span>, <span>public health</span>, regulating intrastate commerce, and local <span>transportation</span> and <span>infrastructure</span> have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities, although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well. Over time, the Constitution has been amended, and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed. The general tendency has been toward centralization and <span>incorporation</span>, with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did. There is a continuing debate over <span>states' rights</span>, which concerns the extent and nature of the states' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals. </p>\n <p>The Constitution grants to Congress the authority to <span>admit new states</span> into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the <span>original 13</span> to 50. <span>Alaska</span> and <span>Hawaii</span> are the most recent states admitted, both in 1959. The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to <span>secede</span> (withdraw) from the Union. Shortly after the <span>Civil War</span>, the <span>U.S. Supreme Court</span>, in <i><span>Texas v. White</span></i>, held that a state cannot unilaterally do so.<sup><span>[5]</span></sup><sup><span>[6]</span></sup></p>\n <div><div lang=en dir=ltr><h2>Contents</h2></div>\n</div>\n <h2 no-attr=empty><span>States of the United States</span></h2> <div role=note>Further information on each U.S. state: <span>List of states and territories of the United States</span> </div>\n <div role=note>See also: <span>List of U.S. state abbreviations</span> </div>\n <p>The 50 U.S. states, in alphabetical order, along with each state's flag: </p>\n <div><div></div>\n</div>\n <div><div><span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/TIHgLPyTTtthY15DDs-eb3KBdErEk7YKEYlnu-m5zRWCFmYzho4ckw==/wiki/U.S._state__-__/tunnel/9xhY3a_g9LhnH2YgxWAHRV2ix0MAz4YysTYpD3AsXTep63qOJq_hD7GARRE=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Map_of_USA_with_state_names_2.svg/570px-Map_of_USA_with_state_names_2.svg.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span></div>\n</div>\n <h2 no-attr=empty><span>Governments</span></h2> <div role=note>Main article: <span>State governments of the United States</span> </div>\n <div role=note>Further information: <span>Comparison of U.S. state governments</span> </div>\n <table><tbody> <tr><th><span>Administrative divisions<br>\nof the United States</span></th></tr> <tr><th> First level</th></tr> <tr><td> <hr> <hr> </td></tr> <tr no-attr=empty><th> Second level</th></tr> <tr><td> <hr> <hr> <hr> </td></tr> <tr><th> Third level</th></tr> <tr><td> <hr> <hr> </td></tr> <tr no-attr=empty><th> Fourth level</th></tr> <tr><td></td></tr> <tr><th> Other areas</th></tr> <tr><td> <hr> <hr> <hr> <hr> <hr> </td></tr> <tr><td><div></div>\n</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p>As sovereign entities, each of the 50 states reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way (within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution) deemed appropriate by its people. As a result, while the governments of the various states share many similar features, they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance. No two state governments are identical. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty><span>Constitutions</span></h3> <div role=note>Further information: <span>State constitution (United States)</span> </div>\n <p>The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution. Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart. The <span>Constitution of Alabama</span>, for example, contains 310,296 words – more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution.<sup><span>[7]</span></sup> In practice, each state has adopted the three-branch frame of the federal government: executive, legislative, and judicial (even though doing so has never been required).<sup><span>[7]</span></sup><sup><span>[8]</span></sup></p>\n <h4><span>Executive</span></h4> <div role=note>Further information: <span>Governor (United States)</span> </div>\n <p>In each state, the chief executive is called the governor, who serves as both <span>head of state</span> and <span>head of government</span>. All governors are chosen by <span>direct election</span>. The governor may approve or <span>veto</span> bills passed by the state legislature, as well as recommend and work for the passage of bills, usually supported by their political party. In 44 states, governors have <span>line item veto</span> power.<sup><span>[9]</span></sup> Most states have a <span>plural executive</span>, meaning that the governor is not the only government official in the state responsible for its <span>executive branch</span>. In these states, executive power is distributed amongst other officials,<sup><span>[10]</span></sup> elected by the people independently of the governor—such as the <span>lieutenant governor</span>, <span>attorney general</span>, <span>comptroller</span>, <span>secretary of state</span>, and others. </p>\n <p>The constitutions of 19 states allow for citizens to remove and replace an elected public official before the end of their term of office through a <span>recall election</span>.<sup><span>[11]</span></sup> Each state follows its own procedures for recall elections, and sets its own restrictions on how often, and how soon after a <span>general election</span>, they may be held. In all states, the legislatures can remove state executive branch officials, including governors, who have committed serious abuses of their power from office. The process of doing so includes <span>impeachment</span> (the bringing of specific charges), and a trial, in which legislators act as a jury.<sup><span>[11]</span></sup></p>\n <h4 no-attr=empty><span>Legislative</span></h4> <div role=note>Further information: <span>State legislature (United States)</span> </div>\n <p>The primary responsibilities of state legislatures are to enact state laws and appropriate money for the administration of public policy.<sup><span>[9]</span></sup> In all states, if the governor vetoes a bill (or a portion of one), it can still become law if the legislature overrides the veto (repasses the bill) by a <span>two-thirds vote</span> in each chamber.<sup><span>[9]</span></sup> In 49 of the 50 states the legislature consists of two chambers: a lower house (termed the House of Representatives, State Assembly, General Assembly or House of Delegates) and a smaller upper house, always termed the Senate. The exception is the <span>unicameral</span><span>Nebraska Legislature</span>, which has only a single chamber. Most states have a <span>part-time</span> legislature (traditionally called a <span>citizen legislature</span>). Ten state legislatures are considered <span>full-time</span>; these bodies are more similar to the U.S. Congress than are the others.<sup><span>[13]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Members of each state's legislature are chosen by direct election. In <i><span>Baker v. Carr</span></i> (1962) and <i><span>Reynolds v. Sims</span></i> (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court held that all states are required to elect their legislatures in such a way as to afford each citizen the same degree of representation (the <span>one person, one vote</span> standard). In practice, most states elect legislators from <span>single-member districts</span>, each of which has approximately the same population. Some states, such as Maryland and Vermont, divide the state into single- and multi-member districts, in which case multi-member districts must have proportionately larger populations, e.g., a district electing two representatives must have approximately twice the population of a district electing just one. The <span>voting systems</span> used across the nation are: <span>first-past-the-post</span> in single-member districts, and <span>multiple non-transferable vote</span> in multi-member districts. </p>\n <p>In 2013, there were a total of 7,383 legislators in the 50 state legislative bodies. They earned from $0 annually (New Mexico) to $90,526 (California). There were various per diem and mileage compensation.<sup><span>[14]</span></sup></p>\n <h4><span>Judicial</span></h4> <div role=note>Further information: <span>State court (United States)</span> </div>\n <p>States can also organize their judicial systems differently from the <span>federal judiciary</span>, as long as they protect the federal constitutional right of their citizens to procedural <span>due process</span>. Most have a trial level court, generally called a <span>District Court</span>, <span>Superior Court</span> or <span>Circuit Court</span>, a first-level <span>appellate court</span>, generally called a Court of Appeal (or Appeals), and a <span>Supreme Court</span>. However, Oklahoma and Texas have separate highest courts for criminal appeals. In New York State the trial court is called the Supreme Court; appeals are then taken to the Supreme Court's Appellate Division, and from there to the Court of Appeals. </p>\n <p>State court systems provide general courts with broad jurisdiction. The overwhelming majority of criminal and civil cases in the United States are heard in state courts. The annual number of cases filed in state courts are around 30,000,000 and the number of judges in state courts is about 30,000—by comparison, federal courts see some 1,000,000 filed cases with about 1700 judges.<sup><span>[15]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Most states base their legal system on English <span>common law</span> (with substantial indigenous changes and incorporation of certain civil law innovations), with the notable exception of Louisiana, a former <span>French colony</span>, which draws large parts of its legal system from French <span>civil law</span>. </p>\n <p>Only a few states choose to have the judges on the state's courts serve for life terms. In most of the states the judges, including the justices of the highest court in the state, are either elected or appointed for terms of a limited number of years, and are usually eligible for re-election or reappointment. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty><span>States as unitary systems</span></h3> <p>All states have <span>unitary governments</span>, local governments are created under state law, and ultimately, local governments within each state are subject to the central authority of that particular state. State governments commonly delegate some authority to local units and channel policy decisions down to them for implementation.<sup><span>[16]</span></sup> In a few states, local units of government are permitted a degree of <span>home rule</span> over various matters. The prevailing legal theory of state preeminence over local governments, referred to as <span>Dillon's Rule</span>, holds that, </p>\n <blockquote><p>A municipal corporation possesses and can exercise the following powers and no others: First, those granted in express words; second, those necessarily implied or necessarily incident to the powers expressly granted; third, those absolutely essential to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation-not simply convenient but indispensable; fourth, any fair doubt as to the existence of a power is resolved by the courts against the corporation-against the existence of the powers.<sup><span>[17]</span></sup></p>\n</blockquote> <p>Each state defines for itself what powers it will allow local governments. Generally, four categories of power may be given to local jurisdictions: </p>\n <blockquote></blockquote> <h2 no-attr=empty><span>Relationships</span></h2> <h3 no-attr=empty><span>Among states</span></h3> <p>Each state admitted to the Union by Congress since 1789 has entered it on an <span>equal footing</span> with the original States in all respects.<sup><span>[19]</span></sup> With the growth of <span>states' rights</span> advocacy during the <span>antebellum period</span>, the Supreme Court asserted, in <i>Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan</i> (1845), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality. With the consent of Congress, states may enter into <span>interstate compacts</span>, agreements between two or more states. Compacts are frequently used to manage a shared resource, such as transportation infrastructure or water rights.</p>\n <p>Under <span>Article IV of the Constitution</span>, which outlines the relationship between the states, each state is required to give <span>full faith and credit</span> to the acts of each other's legislatures and courts, which is generally held to include the recognition of most contracts and criminal judgments, and before 1865, slavery status. Under the <span>Extradition Clause</span>, a state must <span>extradite</span> people located there who have fled charges of \"treason, felony, or other crimes\" in another state if the other state so demands. The principle of <span>hot pursuit</span> of a presumed felon and arrest by the law officers of one state in another state are often permitted by a state.</p>\n <p>The full faith and credit expectation does have exceptions, some legal arrangements, such as professional licensure and marriages, may be state-specific, and until recently states have not been found by the courts to be required to honor such arrangements from other states. Such legal acts are nevertheless often recognized state-to-state according to the common practice of <span>comity</span>. States are prohibited from discriminating against citizens of other states with respect to their <span>basic rights</span>, under the <span>Privileges and Immunities Clause</span>. </p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty><span>With the federal government</span></h3> <div role=note>Further information: <span>Federalism in the United States</span> </div>\n <p>Under Article IV, each state is guaranteed a form of government that is grounded in republican principles, such as the <span>consent of the governed</span>. This guarantee has long been at the fore-front of the debate about the rights of citizens vis-à-vis the government. States are also guaranteed protection from invasion, and, upon the application of the state legislature (or executive, if the legislature cannot be convened), from domestic violence. This provision was discussed during the <span>1967 Detroit riot</span>, but was not invoked. </p>\n <p>The <span>Supremacy Clause</span> (<span>Article VI, Clause 2</span>) establishes that the <span>Constitution</span>, <span>federal laws</span> made pursuant to it, and <span>treaties</span> made under its authority, constitute the supreme law of the land. It provides that <span>state courts</span> are bound by the supreme law; in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law must be applied. Even <span>state constitutions</span> are subordinate to federal law.</p>\n <p><span>States' rights</span> are understood mainly with reference to the <span>Tenth Amendment</span>. The Constitution delegates some powers to the national government, and it forbids some powers to the states. The Tenth Amendment reserves all other powers to the states, or to the people. Powers of the <span>U.S Congress</span> are <span>enumerated</span> in <span>Article I, Section 8</span>, for example, the power to declare war. Making treaties is one power forbidden to the states, being listed among other such powers in <span>Article I, Section 10</span>. </p>\n <p>Among the Article I enumerated powers of Congress is the power to regulate Commerce. Since the early 20th century, the Supreme Court's interpretation of this \"<span>Commerce Clause</span>\" has, over time, greatly expanded scope of <span>federal power</span>, at the expense of powers formerly considered purely states' matters. The <i>Cambridge Economic History of the United States</i> says, \"On the whole, especially after the mid-1880s, the Court construed the Commerce Clause in favor of increased federal power.\" In 1941, the Supreme Court in <i><span>U.S. v. Darby</span></i> upheld the <span>Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938</span>, holding that Congress had the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate employment conditions. Then, one year later, in <i><span>Wickard v. Filburn</span></i>, the Court expanded federal power to regulate the economy by holding that federal authority under the commerce clause extends to activities which may appear to be local in nature but in reality effect the entire national economy and are therefore of national concern. For example, Congress can regulate railway traffic across state lines, but it may also regulate rail traffic solely within a state, based on the reality that intrastate traffic still affects interstate commerce. Through such decisions, argues law professor David F. Forte, \"the Court turned the commerce power into the equivalent of a general regulatory power and undid the Framers' original structure of limited and delegated powers.\" Subsequently, Congress invoked the Commerce Clause to expand federal criminal legislation, as well as for social reforms such as the <span>Civil Rights Act of 1964</span>. Only within the past couple of decades, through decisions in cases such as those in <i><span>U.S. v. Lopez</span></i> (1995) and <i><span>U.S. v. Morrison</span></i> (2000), has the Court tried to limit the Commerce Clause power of Congress.<sup><span>[30]</span></sup></p>\n <p>As prescribed by Article I of the Constitution, which establishes the U.S. Congress, each state is represented in the Senate (irrespective of population size) by two senators, and each is guaranteed at least one representative in the House. Both senators and representatives are chosen in <span>direct popular elections</span> in the various states. (Prior to 1913, senators were elected by state legislatures.) There are presently 100 senators, who are elected <span>at-large</span> to <span>staggered terms</span> of six years, with one-third of them being chosen every two years. Representatives are elected at-large or from <span>single-member districts</span> to terms of two years (not staggered). The size of the House—presently 435 voting members—is set by <span>federal statute</span>. Seats in the House are <span>distributed</span> among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial <span>census</span>. The borders of these districts are established by the states individually through a process called <span>redistricting</span>, and within each state all districts are required to have approximately equal populations.<sup><span>[33]</span></sup></p>\n <p>While the Constitution does set parameters for the election of federal officials, state law, not federal, regulates most aspects of elections in the U.S., including: primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the running of each state's electoral college, as well as the running of state and local elections. All elections—federal, state and local—are administered by the individual states, and some voting rules and procedures may differ among them.<sup><span>[37]</span></sup></p>\n <p><span>Article V of the Constitution</span> accords states a key role in the process of amending the U.S. Constitution.

Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from <span>the original 13</span> to 50. Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states. It also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress. This caveat was designed to give Eastern states that still had <span>Western land claims</span> (including Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia), to have a <span>veto</span> over whether their western counties could become states,<sup><span>[19]</span></sup> and has served this same function since, whenever a <span>proposal to partition</span> an existing state or states in order that a region within might either join another state or to create a new state has come before Congress. </p>\n <p>When the people of a territory make their desire for statehood known to the federal government, Congress may pass an <span>enabling act</span> authorizing the people of that territory to organize a <span>constitutional convention</span> to write a state constitution as a step towards admission to the Union. Each act details the mechanism by which the territory will be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers. Although the use of an enabling act is a traditional historic practice, a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted. Upon acceptance of that constitution, and upon meeting any additional Congressional stipulations, Congress has always admitted that territory as a state. </p>\n <p>In addition to the original 13, six subsequent states were never an organized territory of the federal government, or part of one, before being admitted to the Union. Three were set off from an already existing state, two entered the Union after having been <span>sovereign states</span>, and one was established from <span>unorganized territory</span>: </p>\n <p>Congress is under no obligation to admit states, even in those areas whose population expresses a desire for statehood. Such has been the case numerous times during the nation's history. In one instance, <span>Mormon pioneers</span> in <span>Salt Lake City</span> sought to establish the state of <span>Deseret</span> in 1849. It existed for slightly over two years and was never approved by the <span>United States Congress</span>. In another, leaders of the <span>Five Civilized Tribes</span> (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole) in <span>Indian Territory</span> proposed to establish the state of <span>Sequoyah</span> in 1905, as a means to retain control of their lands.<sup><span>[48]</span></sup> The proposed constitution ultimately failed in the U.S. Congress. Instead, the Indian Territory, along with <span>Oklahoma Territory</span> were both incorporated into the new state of Oklahoma in 1907. The first instance occurred while the nation still operated under the Articles of Confederation. The <span>State of Franklin</span> existed for several years, not long after the end of the American Revolution, but was never recognized by the Confederation Congress, which ultimately recognized <span>North Carolina</span>'s claim of sovereignty over the area. The territory comprising Franklin later became part of the Southwest Territory, and ultimately the state of Tennessee. </p>\n <p>Additionally, the entry of several states into the Union was delayed due to distinctive complicating factors. Among them, <span>Michigan Territory</span>, which petitioned Congress for statehood in 1835, was not admitted to the Union until 1837, due to a <span>boundary dispute</span> with the adjoining state of Ohio. The <span>Republic of Texas</span> requested annexation to the United States in 1837, but fears about potential conflict with Mexico delayed the admission of Texas for nine years.<sup><span>[49]</span></sup> Statehood for <span>Kansas Territory</span> was held up for several years (1854–61) due to a series of internal <span>violent conflicts</span> involving <span>anti-slavery</span> and <span>pro-slavery</span> factions. West Virginia's bid for statehood was also delayed over slavery, and was settled when it agreed to adopt a gradual abolition plan.<sup><span>[50]</span></sup></p>\n <div role=note>Further information: <span>Historic regions of the United States</span> and <span>List of U.S. state partition proposals</span> </div>\n <h2 no-attr=empty><span>Possible new states</span></h2> <div role=note>Further information: <span>51st state</span> </div>\n <h3><span>Puerto Rico</span></h3> <div role=note>Main articles: <span>Political status of Puerto Rico</span> and <span>Proposed political status for Puerto Rico</span> </div>\n <p><span>Puerto Rico</span> referred to itself as the \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" in the English version of its <span>constitution</span>, and as \"Estado Libre Asociado\" (literally, Associated Free State) in the Spanish version. </p>\n <p>As with any non-state territory of the United States, its residents do not have voting representation in the federal government. Puerto Rico has limited representation in Congress in the form of a <span>Resident Commissioner</span>, a delegate with limited voting rights in the <span>Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union</span>, and no voting rights otherwise.<sup><span>[51]</span></sup></p>\n <p>A non-binding referendum on statehood, independence, or a new option for an associated territory (different from the current status) was held on November 6, 2012. Sixty one percent (61%) of voters chose the statehood option, while one third of the ballots were submitted blank.<sup><span>[53]</span></sup></p>\n <p>On December 11, 2012, the <span>Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico</span> enacted a <span>concurrent resolution</span> requesting the <span>President</span> and the <span>Congress of the United States</span> to respond to the referendum of the people of Puerto Rico, held on November 6, 2012, to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit Puerto Rico as a State.<sup><span>[54]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Another <span>status referendum</span> was held on June 11, 2017, in which 97% percent of voters chose statehood. Turnout was low, as only 23% of voters went to the polls, with advocates of both continued territorial status and independence urging voters to boycott it.<sup><span>[55]</span></sup></p>\n <p>On June 27, 2018, the H.R. 6246 Act was introduced on the <span>U.S. House</span> with the purpose of respond to, and comply with, the democratic will of the United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico as expressed in the plebiscites held on November 6, 2012, and June 11, 2017, by setting forth the terms for the admission of the territory of Puerto Rico as a State of the Union.<sup><span>[56]</span></sup> The act has 37 original cosponsors between Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.<sup><span>[57]</span></sup></p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty><span>Washington, D.C.</span></h3> <div role=note>Main article: <span>District of Columbia statehood movement</span> </div>\n <p>The intention of the <span>Founding Fathers</span> was that the United States capital should be at a neutral site, not giving favor to any existing state; as a result, the District of Columbia was created in 1800 to serve as the <span>seat of government</span>. As it is not a state, the district does not have representation in the Senate and has a <span>non-voting delegate</span> in the House; neither does it have a sovereign elected government. Additionally, prior to <span>ratification</span> of the <span>23rd Amendment</span> in 1961, district citizens did not get the <span>right to vote</span> in Presidential elections. </p>\n <p>Some residents of the District support statehood of some form for that jurisdiction – either statehood for the whole district or for the inhabited part, with the remainder remaining under <span>federal jurisdiction</span>. In November 2016, Washington, D.C. residents voted in a <span>statehood referendum</span> in which 86% of voters supported statehood for Washington, D.C.<sup><span>[58]</span></sup> For statehood to be achieved, it must be approved by Congress and signed by the President.<sup><span>[59]</span></sup></p>\n <h3><span>Others</span></h3> <p>Other possible new states are <span>Guam</span> and the <span>U.S. Virgin Islands</span>, both of which are <span>unincorporated organized territories</span> of the United States. Also, either the <span>Northern Mariana Islands</span> or <span>American Samoa</span>, an unorganized, unincorporated territory, could seek statehood. </p>\n <h2 no-attr=empty><span>Secession from the Union</span></h2> <div role=note>Main article: <span>Secession in the United States</span> </div>\n <p>The Constitution is silent on the issue of whether a state can <span>secede</span> from the Union. Its predecessor, the <span>Articles of Confederation</span>, stated that the United States \"shall be <span>perpetual</span>.\" The question of whether or not individual states held the unilateral right to secession was a passionately debated feature of the nations's political discourse from early in its history, and remained a difficult and divisive topic until the <span>American Civil War</span>. In 1860 and 1861, 11 southern states each declared secession from the United States, and joined together to form the <span>Confederate States of America</span> (CSA). Following the defeat of Confederate forces by Union armies in 1865, those states were brought back into the Union during the ensuing <span>Reconstruction Era</span>. The federal government never recognized the sovereignty of the CSA, or the validity of the <span>ordinances of secession</span> adopted by the seceding states.<sup><span>[5]</span></sup><sup><span>[60]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Following the war, the United States Supreme Court, in <i><span>Texas v. White</span></i> (1869), held that states did not have the right to secede and that any act of secession was legally void. Drawing on the <span>Preamble to the Constitution</span>, which states that the Constitution was intended to \"form a more perfect union\" and speaks of the people of the United States in effect as a single body politic, as well as the language of the Articles of Confederation, the Supreme Court maintained that states did not have a right to secede. However, the court's reference in the same decision to the possibility of such changes occurring \"through revolution, or through consent of the States,\" essentially means that this decision holds that no state has a right to unilaterally decide to leave the Union.<sup><span>[5]</span></sup><sup><span>[60]</span></sup></p>\n <h2 no-attr=empty><span>Commonwealths</span></h2> <div role=note>Main article: <span>Commonwealth (U.S. state)</span> </div>\n <p>Four states – Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia – adopted constitutions early in their post-colonial existence identifying themselves as <span>commonwealths</span>, rather than <span>states</span>. These commonwealths are states, but legally, each is a commonwealth because the term is contained in its constitution.<sup><span>[61]</span></sup> As a result, \"commonwealth\" is used in all public and other state writings, actions or activities within their bounds. </p>\n <p>The term, which refers to <i>a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people</i>, was first used in <span>Virginia</span> during the <span>Interregnum</span>, the 1649–60 period between the reigns of <span>Charles I</span> and <span>Charles II</span> during which parliament's <span>Oliver Cromwell</span> as <span>Lord Protector</span> established a <span>republican</span> government known as the <span>Commonwealth of England</span>. Virginia became a royal colony again in 1660, and the word was dropped from the full title. When Virginia adopted its first constitution on June 29, 1776, it was reintroduced. Pennsylvania followed suit when it drew up a constitution later that year, as did Massachusetts, in 1780, and Kentucky, in 1792.<sup><span>[61]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The U.S. <span>territories</span> of the Northern Marianas and Puerto Rico are also referred to as <span>commonwealths</span>. This designation does have a <span>legal status</span> different from that of the 50 states. Both of these commonwealths are <span>unincorporated territories</span> of the United States. </p>\n <h2 no-attr=empty><span>Origins of states' names</span></h2> <div role=note>Further information: <span>List of state and territory name etymologies of the United States</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/3z2j26crn97fYv6KqbKrai-HrxWiYIY1vn5usbXltND4-bylDrv0rw==/wiki/U.S._state__-__/tunnel/V1kujuqALZbhkUTEJPZhBt-F8H8WSgLZ-XKxRyojLdZzWpCJ9bwMqVmi6XE=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/US_State_Name_Etymologies4.png/280px-US_State_Name_Etymologies4.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>A map showing the source languages of state names</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The 50 states have taken their names from a wide variety of languages. Twenty-four state names originate from <span>Native American languages</span>. Of these, eight are from <span>Algonquian languages</span>, seven are from <span>Siouan languages</span>, three are from <span>Iroquoian languages</span>, one is from <span>Uto-Aztecan languages</span> and five others are from other indigenous languages. <span>Hawaii</span>'s name is derived from the <span>Polynesian</span><span>Hawaiian language</span>. </p>\n <p>Of the remaining names, 22 are from European languages: Seven from <span>Latin</span> (mainly <span>Latinized</span> forms of English names), the rest are from English, Spanish and French. Eleven states are <span>named after individual people</span>, including seven named for royalty and one named after a <span>President of the United States</span>. The origins of six state names are unknown or disputed. Several of the states that derive their names from (corrupted) <span>names used for Native peoples</span>, have retained the plural ending of \"s\". </p>\n <h2><span>Geography</span></h2> <h3><span>Borders</span></h3> <p>The borders of the 13 original states were largely determined by <span>colonial charters</span>. Their western boundaries were subsequently modified as the states ceded their western land claims to the Federal government during the 1780s and 1790s. Many state borders beyond those of the original 13 were set by Congress as it created territories, divided them, and over time, created states within them. Territorial and new state lines often followed various geographic features (such as <span>rivers</span> or mountain range peaks), and were influenced by settlement or transportation patterns. At various times, national borders with territories formerly controlled by other countries (<span>British North America</span>, <span>New France</span>, <span>New Spain</span> including <span>Spanish Florida</span>, and <span>Russian America</span>) became institutionalized as the borders of U.S. states. In the West, relatively arbitrary straight lines following latitude and longitude often prevail, due to the sparseness of settlement west of the Mississippi River. </p>\n <p>Once established, most state borders have, with few exceptions, been generally stable. Only two states, Missouri (<span>Platte Purchase</span>) and Nevada, grew appreciably after statehood. Several of the original states <span>ceded land</span>, over a several year period, to the Federal government, which in turn became the Northwest Territory, <span>Southwest Territory</span>, and <span>Mississippi Territory</span>. In 1791 Maryland and Virginia ceded land to create the <span>District of Columbia</span> (Virginia's portion was <span>returned</span> in 1847). In 1850, Texas ceded a large swath of land to the federal government. Additionally, Massachusetts and Virginia (on two occasions), have lost land, in each instance to form a new state. </p>\n <p>There have been numerous other minor adjustments to state boundaries over the years due to improved surveys, resolution of ambiguous or disputed boundary definitions, or minor mutually agreed boundary adjustments for administrative convenience or other purposes.<sup><span>[41]</span></sup> Occasionally, either Congress or the U.S. Supreme Court has had to settle state border disputes. One notable example is the case <i><span>New Jersey v. New York</span></i>, in which <span>New Jersey</span> won roughly 90% of <span>Ellis Island</span> from <span>New York</span> in 1998.<sup><span>[63]</span></sup></p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty><span>Regional grouping</span></h3> <div role=note>Further information: <span>List of regions of the United States</span> </div>\n <p>States may be grouped in regions; there are many variations and possible groupings. Many are defined in law or regulations by the federal government. For example, the United States Census Bureau defines four statistical regions, with nine divisions.<sup><span>[64]</span></sup> The Census Bureau region definition is \"widely used ... for data collection and analysis,\"<sup><span>[65]</span></sup> and is the most commonly used classification system.<sup><span>[66]</span></sup><sup><span>[67]</span></sup><sup><span>[68]</span></sup> Other multi-state regions are unofficial, and defined by geography or cultural affinity rather than by state lines. </p>\n <h2><span>See also</span></h2> <h2><span>References</span></h2> <div><div><ol> <li> <span><b><span>^</span></b></span><span><cite><a rel=nofollow href=\"https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=PEP_2017_PEPANNRES&src=pt\" target=_blank>\"Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017\"</a>.

The <span>arrival of Christopher Columbus</span> in the year 1492 started the <span>European colonization of the Americas</span>. Most colonies were formed after 1600, and the early records and writings of <span>Johnathan Winthrop</span> make the United States the first nation whose most distant origins are fully recorded.<sup><span>[1]</span></sup> By the 1760s, <span>thirteen British colonies</span> contained 2.5 million people along the <span>Atlantic coast</span> east of the <span>Appalachian Mountains</span>. After <span>defeating France</span>, the British government imposed a series of new taxes after 1765, rejecting the colonists' constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval (see <span>Stamp Act 1765</span>). Tax resistance, especially the <span>Boston Tea Party</span> (1773), led to <span>punitive laws</span> by Parliament designed to end self-government in Massachusetts. </p>\n <p>Armed conflict began in 1775. In 1776 in Philadelphia, the <span>Second Continental Congress</span><span>declared the independence</span> of the colonies as the <span>United States</span>. Led by General <span>George Washington</span>, it won the <span>Revolutionary War</span> with large support from France. The <span>peace treaty of 1783</span> gave the new nation the land east of the Mississippi River (except Canada and Florida). The <span>Articles of Confederation</span> established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability, as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A <span>convention</span> in 1787 wrote <span>a new Constitution</span> that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a <span>Bill of Rights</span> was added to guarantee <span>inalienable rights</span>. With Washington as the first president and <span>Alexander Hamilton</span> his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. <span>Purchase</span> of the <span>Louisiana Territory</span> from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States. A second and final war with Britain was <span>fought in 1812</span>, which solidified national pride. </p>\n <p>Encouraged by the notion of <span>manifest destiny</span>, U.S. territory expanded all the way to the <span>Pacific coast</span>. While the United States was large in terms of area, <span>its population</span> by 1790 was only 4 million. However, it grew rapidly, reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 321 million in 2015. Economic growth in terms of overall <span>GDP</span> was even greater. However compared to European powers, the nation's military strength was relatively limited in peacetime before 1940. The expansion was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for <span>yeoman</span> farmers and slave owners. The expansion of <span>slavery</span> was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states <span>north</span> of the <span>Mason–Dixon line</span> by 1804, but the <span>South</span> continued to profit from the institution, mostly from <span>production of cotton</span>. <span>Republican</span><span>Abraham Lincoln</span> was <span>elected president in 1860</span> on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery. </p>\n <p>Seven Southern slave states rebelled and created the foundation of the <span>Confederacy</span>. Its <span>attack of Fort Sumter</span> against the <span>Union forces</span> started the <span>Civil War</span> (1861–1865). Confederate defeat led to the impoverishment of the South and the abolition of slavery. In the <span>Reconstruction Era</span> (1863–1877), <span>legal and voting rights were extended</span> to <span>freed slaves</span>. The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the <span>Fourteenth Amendment</span> in 1868, it gained the explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white <span>Democrats</span> regained their power in the South in 1877, often by <span>paramilitary</span> suppression of voting, they passed <span>Jim Crow laws</span> to maintain <span>white supremacy</span>, and new <span>disfranchising</span> constitutions that prevented most <span>African Americans</span> and many poor whites from voting. This continued until gains of the <span>Civil Rights Movement</span> in the 1960s and passage of federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights were made. </p>\n <p>The United States became the world's leading industrial power at the turn of the 20th century due to an outburst of entrepreneurship in the <span>Northeast</span> and <span>Midwest</span> and the arrival of <span>millions of immigrant workers and farmers from Europe</span>. The national railroad network was completed and large-scale mining and factories industrialized the Northeast and Midwest. Mass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency and traditional politics stimulated the <span>Progressive movement</span>, from the 1890s to 1920s, which led to many reforms including the 16th to 19th constitutional amendments, which brought the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, <span>prohibition</span>, and <span>women's suffrage</span>. Initially neutral during <span>World War I</span>, the United States <span>declared war on Germany</span> in 1917 and funded the Allied victory the following year. Women obtained the <span>right to vote</span> in 1920, with <span>Native Americans</span> obtaining citizenship and the right to vote in 1924. </p>\n <p>After <span>a prosperous decade</span> in the 1920s, the <span>Wall Street Crash of 1929</span> marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide <span>Great Depression</span>. Democratic President <span>Franklin D. Roosevelt</span> ended the Republican dominance of the <span>White House</span> and implemented his <span>New Deal</span> programs, which included relief for the unemployed, support for farmers, <span>Social Security</span> and a <span>minimum wage</span>. The New Deal defined <span>modern American liberalism</span>. After the <span>Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor</span> in 1941, the United States entered <span>World War II</span> and financed the <span>Allied</span> war effort and helped defeat <span>Nazi Germany</span> in the <span>European theater</span>. Its involvement culminated in using newly invented <span>nuclear weapons on two Japanese cities</span> to defeat <span>Imperial Japan</span> in the <span>Pacific theater</span>. </p>\n <p>The United States and the <span>Soviet Union</span> emerged as rival superpowers in the <span>aftermath of World War II</span>. During the <span>Cold War</span>, the two countries confronted each other indirectly in the <span>arms race</span>, the <span>Space Race</span>, <span>proxy wars</span>, and propaganda campaigns. The purpose of this was to stop the spread of communism. In the 1960s, in large part due to the strength of the Civil Rights Movement, another wave of social reforms was enacted by enforcing the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African-Americans and other racial minorities. The Cold War ended when the <span>Soviet Union was officially dissolved</span> in 1991, leaving the United States as the world's only superpower. </p>\n <p>After the Cold War, the United States has been focusing on <span>modern conflicts in the Middle East</span>. The beginning of the 21st century saw the <span>September 11 attacks</span> carried out by <span>Al-Qaeda</span> in 2001, which was later followed by the wars in <span>Iraq</span> and <span>Afghanistan</span>. In 2008, the United States had its <span>worst economic crisis since the Great Depression</span>, which was followed by slower-than-usual rates of economic growth during the 2010s. </p>\n <div><div lang=en dir=ltr><h2>Contents</h2></div>\n</div>\n <h2 no-attr=empty> <span>Pre-Columbian Era</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h2> <div role=note>Main articles: <span>Prehistory of the United States</span>, <span>History of Native Americans in the United States</span>, and <span>Pre-Columbian era</span> </div>\n <div role=note>See also: <span>Native Americans in the United States</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/jtG8MoaN73_OnrWcB1izvP2kWvm9kYiEGlOZH6mZXSjTmDTII_URqw==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/N2WXJzPaN8t0b-AZVp8qsQe7l6SEZ1dyOltsP1sClICrvQ8dVKCNKEqXumc=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Peopling_of_America_through_Beringia.png/200px-Peopling_of_America_through_Beringia.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>This map shows the approximate location of the ice-free corridor and specific Paleoindian sites (<span>Clovis theory</span>).</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>It is not definitively known how or when the Native Americans first <span>settled the Americas</span> and the present-day United States.

The <span>archaeological periods</span> used are the classifications of archaeological periods and cultures established in <span>Gordon Willey</span> and <span>Philip Phillips</span>' 1958 book <i>Method and Theory in American Archaeology</i>. They divided the archaeological record in the Americas into five phases;<sup><span>[4]</span></sup> see <span>Archaeology of the Americas</span>. </p>\n <p>The <span>Clovis culture</span>, a <span>megafauna</span> hunting culture, is primarily identified by use of fluted <span>spear</span> points. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near <span>Clovis, New Mexico</span>. The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. The culture is identified by the distinctive <span>Clovis point</span>, a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute, by which it was inserted into a shaft. Dating of Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of <span>carbon dating</span> methods. Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of 11,050 and 10,800 radiocarbon years <span>B.P.</span> (roughly 9100 to 8850 BCE). </p>\n <p>Numerous <span>Paleoindian</span> cultures occupied North America, with some arrayed around the <span>Great Plains</span> and <span>Great Lakes</span> of the modern <span>United States of America</span> and <span>Canada</span>, as well as adjacent areas to the West and Southwest. According to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, they have been living on this continent since their genesis, described by a wide range of traditional <span>creation stories</span>. Other tribes have stories that recount migrations across long tracts of land and a great river, believed to be the <span>Mississippi River</span>.<sup><span>[5]</span></sup> Genetic and linguistic data connect the indigenous people of this continent with ancient northeast Asians. Archeological and linguistic data has enabled scholars to discover some of the migrations within the Americas. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/ue7xl1E2PlomI5yWxpqrbilhAtEULZtFXvXL5EKRApKdkoMb-M0XHQ==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/I1ITBXbMMWgqJv0-j0KbwhUO-CzuA9gX3a7sH4O3tgpXrhMkE4xbOC1xn9U=/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Folsom_point.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>A <span>Folsom point</span> for a spear.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The <span>Folsom Tradition</span> was characterized by use of <span>Folsom points</span> as projectile tips, and activities known from kill sites, where slaughter and butchering of <span>bison</span> took place. Folsom tools were left behind between 9000 BCE and 8000 BCE.<sup><span>[6]</span></sup></p>\n <p><span>Na-Dené</span>-speaking peoples entered North America starting around 8000 BCE, reaching the <span>Pacific Northwest</span> by 5000 BCE,<sup><span>[7]</span></sup> and from there migrating along the <span>Pacific Coast</span> and into the interior. Linguists, anthropologists and archeologists believe their ancestors comprised a separate migration into North America, later than the first Paleo-Indians. They migrated into Alaska and northern Canada, south along the Pacific Coast, into the interior of Canada, and south to the Great Plains and the American Southwest. </p>\n <p>They were the earliest ancestors of the <span>Athabascan</span>- speaking peoples, including the present-day and historical <span>Navajo</span> and <span>Apache</span>. They constructed large multi-family dwellings in their villages, which were used seasonally. People did not live there year-round, but for the summer to hunt and fish, and to gather food supplies for the winter.<sup><span>[8]</span></sup> The <span>Oshara Tradition</span> people lived from 5500 BCE to 600 CE. They were part of the <span>Southwestern Archaic Tradition</span> centered in north-central <span>New Mexico</span>, the <span>San Juan Basin</span>, the <span>Rio Grande</span> Valley, southern <span>Colorado</span>, and southeastern <span>Utah</span>. </p>\n <p>Since the 1990s, archeologists have explored and dated eleven Middle <span>Archaic</span> sites in present-day Louisiana and Florida at which early cultures built complexes with multiple <span>earthwork</span><span>mounds</span>; they were societies of hunter-gatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary according to the theory of <span>Neolithic Revolution</span> to sustain such large villages over long periods. The prime example is <span>Watson Brake</span> in northern Louisiana, whose 11-mound complex is dated to 3500 BCE, making it the oldest, dated site in the Americas for such complex construction. It is nearly 2,000 years older than the <span>Poverty Point</span> site. Construction of the mounds went on for 500 years until it was abandoned about 2800 BCE, probably due to changing environmental conditions.<sup><span>[9]</span></sup></p>\n <p><span>Poverty Point culture</span> is a Late Archaic <span>archaeological culture</span> that inhabited the area of the lower Mississippi Valley and surrounding Gulf Coast. The culture thrived from 2200 BCE to 700 BCE, during the Late Archaic period.<sup><span>[10]</span></sup> Evidence of this culture has been found at more than 100 sites, from the major complex at <span>Poverty Point</span> (a <span>UNESCO</span><span>World Heritage Site</span>) across a 100-mile (160 km) range to the <span>Jaketown Site</span> near <span>Belzoni, Mississippi</span>. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/gFqCRrhjTC6LYiiOl16KxNiF-0x1ad_FNIvprifYzxllXwLXpPlbzQ==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/0WwhiuAkjzJZOtJjVhHoKH8kEEBu42VJlw4v9wZBw0MqPS-bgnxiVfHT7Xg=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Tlingit_K%27alyaan_Totem_Pole_August_2005.jpg/200px-Tlingit_K%27alyaan_Totem_Pole_August_2005.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The <i>K'alyaan</i><span>Totem Pole</span> of the <span>Tlingit</span> Kiks.ádi Clan, erected at <span>Sitka National Historical Park</span> to commemorate the lives lost in the 1804 <span>Battle of Sitka</span>.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Poverty Point is a 1 square mile (2.6 km<sup>2</sup>) complex of six major earthwork concentric rings, with additional platform mounds at the site. Artifacts show the people traded with other Native Americans located from Georgia to the Great Lakes region. This is one among numerous mound sites of complex indigenous cultures throughout the Mississippi and Ohio valleys. They were one of several succeeding cultures often referred to as <span>mound builders</span>. </p>\n <p>The <span>Woodland period</span> of <span>North American</span><span>pre-Columbian</span> cultures refers to the time period from roughly 1000 BCE to 1000 CE in the eastern part of North America. The term \"Woodland\" was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites dated between the <span>Archaic period</span> and the <span>Mississippian cultures</span>. The <span>Hopewell tradition</span> is the term for the common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern <span>United States</span> from 200 BCE to 500 CE.<sup><span>[11]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The Hopewell tradition was not a single <span>culture</span> or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations, who were connected by a common network of trade routes, known as the Hopewell Exchange System. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern <span>United States</span> into the southeastern <span>Canadian</span> shores of <span>Lake Ontario</span>. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange; most activity was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes. The Hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over the United States. </p>\n <p>The <span>indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast</span> were of many nations and tribal affiliations, each with distinctive cultural and political identities, but they shared certain beliefs, traditions and practices, such as the centrality of <span>salmon</span> as a resource and spiritual symbol.

Parliament quickly responded the next year with the <span>Coercive Acts</span>, stripping Massachusetts of its historic right of self-government and putting it under army rule, which sparked outrage and resistance in all thirteen colonies. Patriot leaders from all 13 colonies convened the <span>First Continental Congress</span> to coordinate their resistance to the Coercive Acts.

They held very strongly a sense of \"rights\" that they felt the British were deliberately violating – rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested in the arrival in Boston of the British Army to punish the Bostonians.

His biggest challenge was logistics, since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers. </p>\n <p>As a battlefield tactician, Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.<sup><span>[51]</span></sup></p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/sCC_Zlt7YxIVBduTAuZvxU-kBRgoMRD3ScMUbm9WgXnMrN0gv395nA==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/V1Fy4Qw6IV8PrXg92RA2c_Zh5s6tYS4S3u8P5lTlWMRkWXVQhPjebu3aU5w=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Declaration_of_Independence_%281819%29%2C_by_John_Trumbull.jpg/220px-Declaration_of_Independence_%281819%29%2C_by_John_Trumbull.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>John Trumbull</span>'s <i><span>Declaration of Independence</span></i> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The Loyalists, whom the British counted upon too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized.

Washington astonished the world when, instead of seizing power for himself, he retired quietly to his farm in Virginia.<sup><span>[51]</span></sup> Political scientist <span>Seymour Martin Lipset</span> observes, \"The United States was the first major colony successfully to revolt against colonial rule. In this sense, it was the first 'new nation'.\"</p>\n <p>On July 2, 1776, the <span>Second Continental Congress</span>, meeting in <span>Philadelphia</span>, declared the independence of the colonies by adopting the resolution from <span>Richard Henry Lee</span>, that stated: </p>\n <blockquote><div>That these United Colonies are, and of right out to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; that measures should be immediately taken for procuring the assistance of foreign powers, and a Confederation be formed to bind the colonies more closely together. </div>\n</blockquote> <p><br>\n</p>\n <p>On July 4, 1776 they adopted the <span>Declaration of Independence</span> and this date is celebrated as the nation's birthday. Historian George Billias says: </p>\n <blockquote><div>Independence amounted to a new status of interdependence: the United States was now a sovereign nation entitled to the privileges and responsibilities that came with that status. America thus became a member of the international community, which meant becoming a maker of treaties and alliances, a military ally in diplomacy, and a partner in foreign trade on a more equal basis.<sup><span>[53]</span></sup> </div>\n</blockquote> <p>On September 9, 1776, Congress officially changed the nation's name to the United States of America.

With the migration of settlers to the Northwest, soon they became states.

The delegates from every state wrote a new <span>Constitution</span> that created a much more powerful and efficient central government, one with a strong president, and powers of taxation. The new government reflected the prevailing republican ideals of guarantees of <span>individual liberty</span> and of constraining the power of government through a system of <span>separation of powers</span>.<sup><span>[56]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The Congress was given authority to ban the international <span>slave trade</span> after 20 years (which it did in 1807). A compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths of the number of slaves in each state's total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade. </p>\n <p>To assuage the Anti-Federalists who feared a too-powerful national government, the nation adopted the <span>United States Bill of Rights</span> in 1791.

They split over the choice of a successor to President <span>James Monroe</span>, and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by <span>Andrew Jackson</span> and <span>Martin Van Buren</span>, became the Democratic Party.

They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"corrupt bargain\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. ... Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual (the \"common man,\" i.e. the artisan and the ordinary farmer) by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns.

Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the \"Wild West\" of the second half of the 19th century. As defined by Hine and Faragher, \"frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states\". They explain, \"It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America.\"<sup><span>[95]</span></sup> The first settlers in the west were the Spanish in New Mexico; they became U.S. citizens in 1848. The Hispanics in California (\"<span>Californios</span>\") were overwhelmed by over 100,000 gold rush miners. California grew explosively. San Francisco by 1880 had become the economic hub of the entire Pacific Coast with a diverse population of a quarter million. </p>\n <p>From the early 1830s to 1869, the <span>Oregon Trail</span> and its many offshoots were used by over 300,000 settlers. '49ers (in the <span>California Gold Rush</span>), ranchers, farmers, and entrepreneurs and their families headed to California, Oregon, and other points in the far west. Wagon-trains took five or six months on foot; after 1869, the trip took 6 days by rail.<sup><span>[96]</span></sup></p>\n <p><span>Manifest Destiny</span> was the belief that American settlers were destined to expand across the continent. This concept was born out of \"A sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example ... generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven\".<sup><span>[97]</span></sup> Manifest Destiny was rejected by modernizers, especially the Whigs like Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln who wanted to build cities and factories – not more farms.<sup><span>[98]</span></sup><span>Democrats</span> strongly favored expansion, and won the key election of 1844.

The <span>Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</span> ended the war in 1848. Many Democrats wanted to annex all of Mexico, but that idea was rejected by southerners who argued that by incorporating millions of Mexican people, mainly of mixed race, would undermine the United States as an exclusively white republic.<sup><span>[100]</span></sup> Instead the U.S. took Texas and the lightly settled northern parts (California and New Mexico).

A small number of active Northerners were <span>abolitionists</span> who declared that ownership of slaves was a sin (in terms of Protestant theology) and demanded its immediate abolition. Much larger numbers in the North were against the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that America would be committed to free land (as in low-cost farms owned and cultivated by a family), free labor, and free speech (as opposed to censorship of abolitionist material in the South). Southern whites insisted that slavery was of economic, social, and cultural benefit to all whites (and even to the slaves themselves), and denounced all anti-slavery spokesmen as \"abolitionists\".<sup><span>[101]</span></sup> Justifications of slavery included economics, history, religion, legality, social good, and even humanitarianism, to further their arguments. Defenders of slavery argued that the sudden end to the slave economy would have had a profound and killing economic impact in the South where reliance on slave labor was the foundation of their economy. They also argued that if all the slaves were freed, there would be widespread unemployment and chaos.</p>\n <p>Religious activists split on slavery, with the <span>Methodists</span> and <span>Baptists</span> dividing into northern and southern denominations. In the North, the Methodists, <span>Congregationalists</span>, and <span>Quakers</span> included many <span>abolitionists</span>, especially among women activists. (The <span>Catholic</span>, <span>Episcopal</span> and <span>Lutheran</span> denominations largely ignored the slavery issue.)<sup><span>[103]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The issue of slavery in the new territories was seemingly settled by the <span>Compromise of 1850</span>, brokered by Whig <span>Henry Clay</span> and Democrat <span>Stephen Douglas</span>; the Compromise included the admission of California as a <span>free state</span> in exchange for no federal restrictions on slavery placed on Utah or New Mexico.<sup><span>[104]</span></sup> The point of contention was the <span>Fugitive Slave Act</span>, which increased federal enforcement and required even free states to cooperate in turning over fugitive slaves to their owners. Abolitionists pounced on the Act to attack slavery, as in the best-selling anti-slavery <span>novel</span><i><span>Uncle Tom's Cabin</span></i> by <span>Harriet Beecher Stowe</span>.<sup><span>[105]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The <span>Compromise of 1820</span> was repealed in 1854 with the <span>Kansas–Nebraska Act</span>, promoted by Senator Douglas in the name of \"<span>popular sovereignty</span>\" and democracy. It permitted voters to decide on the legality slavery in each territory, and allowed Douglas to adopt neutrality on the issue of slavery. Anti-slavery forces rose in anger and alarm, forming the new <span>Republican Party</span>. Pro- and anti- contingents rushed to Kansas to vote slavery up or down, resulting in a miniature civil war called <span>Bleeding Kansas</span>. By the late 1850s, the young Republican Party dominated nearly all northern states and thus the electoral college. It insisted that slavery would never be allowed to expand (and thus would slowly die out).<sup><span>[106]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The Southern slavery-based societies had become wealthy based on their <span>cotton</span> and other agricultural <span>commodity</span> production, and some particularly profited from the internal slave trade. Northern cities such as Boston and New York, and regional industries, were tied economically to slavery by banking, shipping, and manufacturing, including <span>textile mills</span>. By 1860, there were four million slaves in <span>the South</span>, nearly eight times as many as there were nationwide in 1790. The <span>plantations</span> were highly profitable, due to the heavy European demand for raw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves (largely drawn from the declining <span>tobacco</span> regions). </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/AB8wDvofyHzy4lB1KfdUKUOiDGrHP08vNJaHeMxbvznu9Qg2IxFSiA==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/pRbXtwuXQY1OE6vCSeHEprBkUVSyhjyy2rAcZkJDk8PD70c5F0FFnN832fw=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/National-atlas-1970-1860.png/300px-National-atlas-1970-1860.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The United States, immediately before the Civil War.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the <span>Missouri Compromise</span>. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in <i><span>Dred Scott v. Sandford</span></i> ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution. </p>\n <p>After <span>Abraham Lincoln</span> won the <span>1860 election</span>, seven Southern states <span>seceded</span> from the union and set up a new nation, the <span>Confederate States of America</span> (Confederacy), on February 8, 1861.

When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the Confederacy in April 1861, four more states seceded and joined the Confederacy.

In response to the attack, on April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and \"preserve the Union\", which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had their first major clash at the <span>First Battle of Bull Run</span> (Battle of Manassas), ending in a Union defeat, but, more importantly, proved to both the Union and Confederacy that the war would be much longer and bloodier than originally anticipated.<sup><span>[109]</span></sup></p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/avTigDLlZbO6-x5XXj5KAQPtiVp3fw25x0o6iwELKSyMeV7mXW7jdQ==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/qlr-vXFGkO1uLc8s2TjVMbGeKhqUkmwzXhLfg1LCShKO5kNirw7vPdgbdgo=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg/250px-PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Lincoln with <span>Allan Pinkerton</span> and Major General <span>John Alexander McClernand</span> at the <span>Battle of Antietam</span>.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The war soon divided into two theaters: <span>Eastern</span> and <span>Western</span>. In the western theater, the Union was relatively successful, with major battles, such as <span>Perryville</span> and <span>Shiloh</span> along with Union gunboat dominance of navigable rivers producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations.<sup><span>[110]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Warfare in the Eastern theater began poorly for the Union as the Confederates won at Manassas Junction (Bull Run), just outside Washington. Major General <span>George B. McClellan</span> was put in charge of the Union armies. After reorganizing the new <span>Army of the Potomac</span>, McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of <span>Richmond, Virginia</span> in his <span>Peninsula Campaign</span> and <span>retreated after attacks</span> from newly appointed Confederate General <span>Robert E. Lee</span>.<sup><span>[111]</span></sup> Meanwhile, both sides concentrated in 1861–62 on raising and training new armies. The main action was Union success in controlling the border states, with Confederates largely driven out of Maryland, West Virginia (a new state), Kentucky and Missouri. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland was designed to hurt Union morale and win European support. It ended with Confederate retreat at the <span>Battle of Antietam</span>, and Lincoln's warning he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 if the states did not return. Making slavery a central war goal Energized Republicans in the North, as well as their enemies, the anti-war Copperhead Democrats. It ended the risk of British and French intervention. </p>\n <p>Lee's smaller army won at the <span>Battle of Fredericksburg</span> late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the <span>Battle of Chancellorsville</span> in May 1863, while losing his top aide, <span>Stonewall Jackson</span>. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause <span>war-weariness</span> in the North. In perhaps the <span>turning point of the war</span>, Lee's army was badly beaten at the <span>Battle of Gettysburg</span>, July 1–3, 1863, and barely made it back to Virginia. On the homefront, industrial expansion in the North expanded dramatically, using its extensive railroad service, and moving industrial workers into munitions factories. Foreign trade increased, with the United States providing both food and cotton to Britain, And Britain sending in manufactured products and thousands of volunteers for the Union Army (plus a few to the Confederates). The British operated blockade runners bringing in food, luxury items and munitions to the Confederacy, bringing out tobacco and cotton. The Union blockade increasingly shut down Confederate ports, and by late 1864 the blockade runners Were usually captured before they could make more than handful of runs. </p>\n <div><div> <div><audio controls preload=none data-durationhint=109.69609977324 data-startoffset=0 data-mwtitle=Gettysburg_by_Britton.ogg data-mwprovider=wikimediacommons><source src=//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Gettysburg_by_Britton.ogg type='audio/ogg; codecs=\"vorbis\"' data-title=\"Original Ogg file (131 kbps)\" data-shorttitle=\"Ogg source\" data-width=0 data-height=0 data-bandwidth=130787><source src=//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/a/a1/Gettysburg_by_Britton.ogg/Gettysburg_by_Britton.ogg.mp3 type=audio/mpeg data-title=MP3 data-shorttitle=MP3 data-transcodekey=mp3 data-width=0 data-height=0 data-bandwidth=220752></audio></div>\n <div>Modern recording of <span>Gettysburg Address</span> originally spoken by <span>U.S President</span><span>Abraham Lincoln</span> </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/C1veEbHfa8upQmX-TQSkm7BZW6w-QT-4n6N9CfgZM_7zn70XelUHnA==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/cMipIrFy1BJ2oOgYheeS5y7qgwXd_5y9miSn3T2ec-ffDALF6zlbaUpzReg=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Kurz_and_Allison_-_Battle_of_Franklin%2C_November_30%2C_1864.jpg/300px-Kurz_and_Allison_-_Battle_of_Franklin%2C_November_30%2C_1864.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The <span>Battle of Franklin</span>, November 30, 1864.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>In the West, on July 4, 1863, Union forces under the command of General <span>Ulysses S. Grant</span> gained control of the Mississippi River at the <span>Battle of Vicksburg</span>, thereby splitting the Confederacy. Lincoln made General Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant put General William Tecumseh Sherman in charge of the Western armies. In 1864, Sherman marched south from Chattanooga to capture Atlanta, a decisive victory that ended war jitters among Republicans in the North who feared they might fail to reelect Lincoln in 1864. Lincoln won a landslide. The last two years of the war were bloody for both sides, With Sherman marching almost unopposed through central and eastern Georgia, then moving up through South Carolina and North Carolina, burning cities, destroying plantations, ruining railroads and bridges, but avoiding civilian casualties. Sherman demonstrated that the South lacked the long-term ability to resist a northern invasion. Much of the heartland of the Confederacy was physically destroyed, and could no longer provide desperately needed food, horses, mules, wagons, boots or munitions to its combat armies. In spring 1864 Grant, realizing that Lee was unable to replenishes casualties, while Lincoln would provide replacements for Union losses, launched a <span>war of attrition</span> against Lee's <span>Army of Northern Virginia</span>. This war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns. The first of these, the <span>Overland Campaign</span> forced Lee to retreat into the city of Petersburg where Grant launched his second major offensive, the <span>Richmond-Petersburg Campaign</span> in which he <span>besieged Petersburg</span>. After a near ten-month siege, Petersburg surrendered. However, the <span>defense of Fort Gregg</span> allowed Lee to move his army out of Petersburg. Grant pursued and launched the final, <span>Appomattox Campaign</span> which resulted in Lee surrendering his Army of Northern Virginia numbering 28,000 on April 9, 1865, at <span>Appomattox Court House</span>. Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended with no postwar insurgency. </p>\n <p>The American Civil War was the world's earliest <span>industrial war</span>. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in <span>World War I</span>. It remains the deadliest war in American history, resulting in the deaths of about 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of <span>civilian casualties</span>.<sup><span>[113]</span></sup> About ten percent of all Northern males 20–45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18–40 died.<sup><span>[114]</span></sup> Its legacy includes ending slavery in the United States, restoring the Union, and strengthening the role of the federal government. </p>\n <p>According to historian <span>Allan Nevins</span> the Civil War had a major long-term impact on the United States in terms of developing its leadership potential and moving the entire nation beyond the adolescent stage: </p>\n <dl no-attr=empty><dd>The fighting and its attendant demands upon industry, finance, medicine, and law also helped train a host of leaders who during the next 35 years, to 1900, made their influence powerfully felt on most of the social, economic, and cultural fronts. It broke down barriers of parochialism; it ended distrust of large-scale effort; it hardened and matured the whole people emotionally. The adolescent land of the 1850s...rose under the blows of battle to adult estate. The nation of the post-Appomattox generation, though sadly hurt (especially in the South) by war losses, and deeply scarred psychologically (especially in the North) by war hatreds and greeds, had at last the power, resolution, and self-trust of manhood.<sup><span>[115]</span></sup> </dd></dl> <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Emancipation</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div role=note>See also: <span>Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War</span> and <span>Emancipation Proclamation</span> </div>\n <div><div> <div><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/FnsiemLoJFeAUO9osnqhKY3himo616yvmfjVzes7F866WX6BOGjOkA==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/n2grkXCtjTUapaOqvU2GcaiBZilTJsxmzpbvmcaont3RHuZjpXCHhuCGNl0=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Emancipation_proclamation.jpg/300px-Emancipation_proclamation.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></div>\n <div> <i><span>First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln</span></i> by <span>Francis Bicknell Carpenter</span><sup><span>[116]</span></sup><br>\n<br>\n(People in the image are clickable.)</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <div><div> <div><audio controls preload=none data-durationhint=310.17795918367 data-startoffset=0 data-mwtitle=\"The_Emancipation_Proclamation_-_read_by_Winston_Tharp_for_LibriVox's_Short_Nonfiction_Collection_Vol._028_(2013).ogg\" data-mwprovider=wikimediacommons><source src=//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/The_Emancipation_Proclamation_-_read_by_Winston_Tharp_for_LibriVox%27s_Short_Nonfiction_Collection_Vol._028_%282013%29.ogg type='audio/ogg; codecs=\"vorbis\"' data-title=\"Original Ogg file (63 kbps)\" data-shorttitle=\"Ogg source\" data-width=0 data-height=0 data-bandwidth=63083><source src=//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/e/e9/The_Emancipation_Proclamation_-_read_by_Winston_Tharp_for_LibriVox%27s_Short_Nonfiction_Collection_Vol._028_%282013%29.ogg/The_Emancipation_Proclamation_-_read_by_Winston_Tharp_for_LibriVox%27s_Short_Nonfiction_Collection_Vol._028_%282013%29.ogg.mp3 type=audio/mpeg data-title=MP3 data-shorttitle=MP3 data-transcodekey=mp3 data-width=0 data-height=0 data-bandwidth=108648></audio></div>\n <div>Modern reading of President <span>Abraham Lincoln's</span><span>Emancipation Proclamation</span> of 1863 giving freedom to all <span>African Americans</span> who resided within the <span>Confederacy</span> but not those within the <span>Union</span>.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The <span>Emancipation Proclamation</span> was an executive order issued by President <span>Abraham Lincoln</span> on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves.<sup><span>[117]</span></sup> Large numbers moved into camps run by the <span>Freedmen's Bureau</span>, where they were given food, shelter, medical care, and arrangements for their employment were made. </p>\n <p>The severe dislocations of war and Reconstruction had a large negative impact on the black population, with a large amount of sickness and death.<sup><span>[118]</span></sup></p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Reconstruction Era</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div role=note>Main article: <span>Reconstruction Era</span> </div>\n <div role=note>See also: <span>History of the United States (1865–1918)</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/e4aAK83tVIoxhJAcDFaNEeJCRMOgcs6bh88pIoMXMaBpPNEbCSkcyw==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/gn6sTCQjFrc2kJRfnWmC7Sc63kbkEOI8VP40vZD7Pi39C_7Ry8Z5rFt4Nk0=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/FreedmenVotingInNewOrleans1867.jpeg/300px-FreedmenVotingInNewOrleans1867.jpeg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>Freedmen</span> voting in New Orleans, 1867.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Reconstruction lasted from Lincoln's <span>Emancipation Proclamation</span> of January 1, 1863 to the <span>Compromise of 1877</span>.<sup><span>[119]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The major issues faced by Lincoln were the status of the ex-slaves (called \"Freedmen\"), the loyalty and civil rights of ex-rebels, the status of the 11 ex-Confederate states, the powers of the federal government needed to prevent a future civil war, and the question of whether Congress or the President would make the major decisions. </p>\n <p>The severe threats of starvation and displacement of the unemployed Freedmen were met by the first major federal relief agency, the <span>Freedmen's Bureau</span>, operated by the Army.</p>\n <p>Three \"<span>Reconstruction Amendments</span>\" were passed to expand civil rights for black Americans: the <span>Thirteenth Amendment</span> outlawed slavery; the <span>Fourteenth Amendment</span> guaranteed equal rights for all and citizenship for blacks; the <span>Fifteenth Amendment</span> prevented race from being used to disfranchise men. </p>\n <p>Ex-Confederates remained in control of most Southern states for over two years, but changed when the <span>Radical Republicans</span> gained control of Congress in the 1866 elections.

Other important legislation included the <span>Interstate Commerce Act</span>, which ended railroads' discrimination against small shippers, and the <span>Sherman Antitrust Act</span>, which outlawed monopolies in business.

In every major city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change. Leading politicians from both parties, most notably <span>Theodore Roosevelt</span>, <span>Charles Evans Hughes</span>, and <span>Robert La Follette</span> on the Republican side, and <span>William Jennings Bryan</span> and <span>Woodrow Wilson</span> on the Democratic side, took up the cause of progressive reform. Women became especially involved in demands for woman suffrage, prohibition, and better schools; their most prominent leader was <span>Jane Addams</span> of Chicago, who created <span>settlement houses</span>. <span>\"Muckraking\" journalists</span> such as <span>Upton Sinclair</span>, <span>Lincoln Steffens</span> and <span>Jacob Riis</span> exposed corruption in business and government along with rampant inner city poverty. Progressives implemented anti-trust laws and regulated such industries of meat-packing, drugs, and railroads. Four new constitutional amendments – the <span>Sixteenth</span> through <span>Nineteenth</span> – resulted from progressive activism, bringing the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, prohibition, and woman suffrage. The period also saw a major transformation of the banking system with the creation of the <span>Federal Reserve System</span> in 1913<sup><span>[143]</span></sup> and the arrival of <span>cooperative banking</span> in the US with the founding of the first <span>credit union</span> in 1908.<sup><span>[144]</span></sup> The Progressive Movement lasted through the 1920s; the most active period was 1900–18.<sup><span>[145]</span></sup></p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>Imperialism</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div role=note>Further information: <span>American imperialism</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/FXwpThge4lpJXBd31ptetgzqYyPsCXES4mxZJzXyhK7kRx5-xmBA0A==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/EIo_vWdzFNfatxjH9VnxZKpIOR_WrNTpEGYeFsyEGv_ziZsDHVeDeVq2Y5U=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Victor_Gillam_A_Thing_Well_Begun_Is_Half_Done_1899_Cornell_CUL_PJM_1136_01.jpg/220px-Victor_Gillam_A_Thing_Well_Begun_Is_Half_Done_1899_Cornell_CUL_PJM_1136_01.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>This cartoon reflects the view of <span>Judge magazine</span> regarding America's imperial ambitions following a quick victory in the Spanish–American War of 1898.<sup><span>[146]</span></sup> The American flag flies from the Philippines and Hawaii in the Pacific to Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The United States emerged as a world economic and military power after 1890. The main episode was the <span>Spanish–American War</span>, which began when Spain refused American demands to reform its oppressive policies in <span>Cuba</span>.<sup><span>[147]</span></sup> The \"splendid little war\", as one official called it, involved a series of quick American victories on land and at sea. At the <span>Treaty of Paris</span> peace conference the United States acquired the <span>Philippines</span>, <span>Puerto Rico</span>, and <span>Guam</span>.<sup><span>[148]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Cuba became an independent country, under close American tutelage. Although the war itself was widely popular, the peace terms proved controversial. William Jennings Bryan led his Democratic Party in opposition to control of the Philippines, which he denounced as <span>imperialism</span> unbecoming to American democracy.<sup><span>[148]</span></sup> President <span>William McKinley</span> defended the acquisition and was riding high as the nation had returned to prosperity and felt triumphant in the war.

In 1912 when Arizona became the final <span>mainland state</span>, the <span>American Frontier</span> came to an end. The canal opened in 1914 and increased trade with Japan and the rest of the Far East. A key innovation was the <span>Open Door Policy</span>, whereby the imperial powers were given equal access to Chinese business, with not one of them allowed to take control of China.<sup><span>[151]</span></sup></p>\n <h3> <span>World War I</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div role=note>Main articles: <span>American entry into World War I</span> and <span>United States home front during World War I</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/JC3cAlYPlEw-lTLheQi9bMtnOkLqVz8bSATC78sQFeSHKL4okaFZAA==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/IdYUbPxnTkq1FYvZet7jYN3ndo2rWSVYN455EyRZSQdojtCEKA3yPYZs_iU=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Cimeti%C3%A8re_am%C3%A9ricain_de_Romagne-sous-Montfaucon_-_1918_-_France.JPG/220px-Cimeti%C3%A8re_am%C3%A9ricain_de_Romagne-sous-Montfaucon_-_1918_-_France.JPG\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div><span>American Cemetery at Romagne-sous-Montfaucon</span></div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>As <span>World War I</span> raged in Europe from 1914, President Woodrow Wilson took full control of foreign policy, declaring neutrality but warning Germany that resumption of <span>unrestricted submarine warfare</span> against American ships supplying goods to Allied nations would mean war.

American money, food, and munitions arrived quickly, but troops had to be drafted and trained; by summer 1918 American soldiers under General <span>John J.

Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman <span>Jeannette Rankin</span> of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting. Congress passed the <span>Nineteenth Amendment</span> in 1919, and women could vote in 1920.</p>\n <p>NAWSA became the <span>League of Women Voters</span>, and the National Woman's Party began lobbying for full equality and the <span>Equal Rights Amendment</span>, which would pass Congress during the second wave of the women's movement in 1972. Politicians responded to the new electorate by emphasizing issues of special interest to women, especially prohibition, child health, and world peace.<sup><span>[163]</span></sup><sup><span>[164]</span></sup> The main surge of women voting came in 1928, when the big-city machines realized they needed the support of women to elect <span>Al Smith</span>, a Catholic from New York City.

Roosevelt</span> promised \"a <span>New Deal</span> for the American people\", coining the enduring label for his domestic policies. The result was a series of permanent reform programs including Relief for the unemployed, assistance for the elderly, jobs for young men, social security, unemployment insurance, public housing, bankruptcy insurance, farm subsidies, and regulation of financial securities. State governments added new programs as well, and introduced the sales tax to pay for them. Ideologically the revolution established <span>modern liberalism in the United States</span> and kept the Democrats in power in Washington almost continuously for Three decades thanks to the <span>New Deal Coalition</span> of ethnic Whites, Blacks, blue-collar workers, labor unions, and white Southerners. It provided relief to the long-term unemployed through numerous programs, such as the <span>Works Progress Administration</span> (WPA) and for young men, the <span>Civilian Conservation Corps</span>. Large scale spending projects designed to provide private sector construction jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the <span>Public Works Administration</span>. The Second New Deal was a turn to the left in 1935–36, building up labor unions through the <span>Wagner Act</span>. Unions became a powerful element of the merging <span>New Deal Coalition</span>, which won reelection for Roosevelt in 1936, 1940, and 1944 by mobilizing union members, blue collar workers, relief recipients, big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups (especially Catholics and Jews) and the white South, along with blacks in the North (where they could vote). Roosevelt seriously weakened his second term by a failed effort to pack the Supreme Court, which had been a center of conservative resistance to his programs. Most of the relief programs were dropped after 1938 in the 1940s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the <span>Conservative Coalition</span>. Of special importance is the <span>Social Security program</span>, begun in 1935. The economy basically recovered by 1936, but had a sharp, short recession in 1937-38; long-term unemployment, however, remained a problem until it was solved by wartime spending.<sup><span>[171]</span></sup></p>\n <p>In an effort to denounce past U.S. interventionism and subdue any subsequent fears of Latin Americans, Roosevelt announced on March 4, 1933, during his inaugural address, \"In the field of World policy, I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor, the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others, the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a World of neighbors.\" In order to create a friendly relationship between the United States and Central as well as South American countries, Roosevelt sought to stray from asserting military force in the region.<sup><span>[173]</span></sup> This position was affirmed by <span>Cordell Hull</span>, Roosevelt's <span>Secretary of State</span> at a conference of American states in <span>Montevideo</span> in December 1933. </p>\n <h3> <span>World War II</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div role=note>Further information: <span>World War II</span>, <span>Military history of the United States during World War II</span>, and <span>United States home front during World War II</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/cK5TV6pB5amwHY_qx2ubV6KuSsIiHNQMwkPsNHu8r2gq3iRk5GlmBw==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/g1T2B0tgb5eU77ji1epTutSfBi0wpSXqK-EP6FR_TCvpDwrqQB90wwgF0Gc=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/The_USS_Arizona_%28BB-39%29_burning_after_the_Japanese_attack_on_Pearl_Harbor_-_NARA_195617_-_Edit.jpg/220px-The_USS_Arizona_%28BB-39%29_burning_after_the_Japanese_attack_on_Pearl_Harbor_-_NARA_195617_-_Edit.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>The Japanese crippled American naval power with the <span>attack on Pearl Harbor</span>, destroying many battleships.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>In the Depression years, the United States remained focused on domestic concerns while democracy declined across the world and many countries fell under the control of dictators. <span>Imperial Japan</span> asserted dominance in East Asia and in the Pacific. <span>Nazi Germany</span> and <span>Fascist Italy</span> militarized and threatened conquests, while Britain and France attempted <span>appeasement</span> to avert another war in Europe.

Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked. </p>\n <div><div> <div><audio controls preload=none data-durationhint=521.220861678 data-startoffset=0 data-mwtitle=Roosevelt_Pearl_Harbor.ogg data-mwprovider=wikimediacommons><source src=//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Roosevelt_Pearl_Harbor.ogg type='audio/ogg; codecs=\"vorbis\"' data-title=\"Original Ogg file (51 kbps)\" data-shorttitle=\"Ogg source\" data-width=0 data-height=0 data-bandwidth=51091><source src=//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/f/fd/Roosevelt_Pearl_Harbor.ogg/Roosevelt_Pearl_Harbor.ogg.mp3 type=audio/mpeg data-title=MP3 data-shorttitle=MP3 data-transcodekey=mp3 data-width=0 data-height=0 data-bandwidth=84648></audio></div>\n <div>President Roosevelt's <span>Infamy Speech</span> in aftermath of <span>Pearl Harbor Attack</span>.

The <span>U.S. Senate</span> on a bipartisan vote approved U.S. participation in the United Nations (UN), which marked a turn away from the traditional <span>isolationism</span> of the U.S. and toward increased international involvement. </p>\n <p>The primary American goal of 1945–48 was to rescue Europe from the devastation of World War II and to contain the expansion of Communism, represented by the <span>Soviet Union</span>. <span>U.S. foreign policy</span> during the Cold War was built around the support of <span>Western Europe</span> and <span>Japan</span> along with the policy of <span>containment</span>, stopping the spread of <span>communism</span>. The U.S. joined the wars in <span>Korea</span> and <span>Vietnam</span> and <span>toppled left-wing governments in the third world</span> to try to stop its spread. The <span>Truman Doctrine</span> of 1947 provided military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey to counteract the threat of Communist expansion in the Balkans. In 1948, the United States replaced piecemeal financial aid programs with a comprehensive <span>Marshall Plan</span>, which pumped money into the economy of Western Europe, and removed trade barriers, while modernizing the managerial practices of businesses and governments.<sup><span>[193]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The Plan's $13 billion budget was in the context of a U.S. GDP of $258 billion in 1948 and was in addition to the $12 billion in American aid given to Europe between the end of the war and the start of the Marshall Plan. Soviet head of state <span>Joseph Stalin</span> prevented <span>his satellite states</span> from participating, and from that point on, Eastern Europe, with inefficient centralized economies, fell further and further behind Western Europe in terms of economic development and prosperity. In 1949, the United States, rejecting the long-standing policy of no military alliances in peacetime, formed the <span>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</span> (NATO) alliance, which continues into the 21st century. In response the Soviets formed the <span>Warsaw Pact</span> of communist states, leading to the \"<span>iron curtain</span>\".<sup><span>[193]</span></sup> In August 1949 the Soviets tested their first nuclear weapon, thereby escalating the risk of warfare. The threat of <span>mutually assured destruction</span> however, prevented both powers from nuclear war, and resulted in proxy wars, especially in <span>Korea</span> and <span>Vietnam</span>, in which the two sides did not directly confront each other.<sup><span>[191]</span></sup></p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/uBmxYcv2sVFSvGv93fwqEF2FYsA9SY5nlBSWd6vD63Vmb4nqzsHPSA==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/gzwzw98Z2iCtGwzKKy_jUc5ns-LQJ0mIGomwsAHawhRoY3anLWV7cEmVi9o=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/I_Like_Ike_button%2C_1952.png/170px-I_Like_Ike_button%2C_1952.png\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Eisenhower button from the 1952 campaign</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>President Dwight D Eisenhower, elected in a landslide as the first Republican president since 1932, had a lasting impact on American life and politics.<sup><span>[194]</span></sup> He ended the Korean War, and avoided any other major conflict.

He gave strong support to the NATO alliance, and built other alliances along similar lines, but they never were especially effective.

Reagan's economic policies (dubbed \"<span>Reaganomics</span>\") and the implementation of the <span>Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981</span> lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 28% over the course of seven years. Reagan continued to downsize government taxation and regulation. The U.S. experienced a recession in 1982, but the negative indicators reversed, with the inflation rate decreasing from 11% to 2%, the unemployment rate decreasing from 10.8% in December 1982 to 7.5% in November 1984, and the economic growth rate increasing from 4.5% to 7.2%.</p>\n <p>Reagan ordered a buildup of the U.S. military, incurring additional budget deficits. Reagan introduced a complicated missile defense system known as the <span>Strategic Defense Initiative</span> (SDI) (dubbed \"Star Wars\" by opponents) in which, theoretically, the U.S. could shoot down missiles with laser systems in space. The Soviets reacted harshly because they thought it violated the 1972 <span>Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty</span>, and would upset the balance of power by giving the U.S. a major military advantage. For years Soviet leader <span>Mikhail Gorbachev</span> argued vehemently against SDI. However, by the late 1980s he decided the system would never work and should not be used to block disarmament deals with the U.S. Historians argue how great an impact the SDI threat had on the Soviets – whether it was enough to force Gorbachev to initiate radical reforms, or whether the deterioration of the Soviet economy alone forced the reforms. There is agreement that the Soviets realized they were well behind the Americans in military technology, that to try to catch up would be very expensive, and that the military expenses were already a very heavy burden slowing down their economy.</p>\n <p>Reagan's <span>Invasion of Grenada</span> and <span>bombing of Libya</span> were popular in the U.S, though his backing of the <span>Contras</span> rebels was mired in the controversy over the <span>Iran–Contra affair</span> that revealed Reagan's poor management style.</p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/U3BS8zR-_HhJkkervLu70hvBGBL03GsQa9t5XhzzPKyoEvK9KmvjjA==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/Ef18code79VRaUlLMeDLgm9B6pK-2kVz5NuYZ0lME4-Xzc5rLhfJBmaMxVg=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/President_Reagan_and_Sandra_Day_O%27Connor.jpg/220px-President_Reagan_and_Sandra_Day_O%27Connor.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Supreme Court Justice-nominee <span>Sandra Day O'Connor</span> talks with President <span>Ronald Reagan</span> outside the <span>White House</span>, July 15, 1981.

After his election, Obama reluctantly continued the war effort in Iraq until August 31, 2010, when he declared that combat operations had ended. However, 50,000 American soldiers and military personnel were kept in Iraq to assist Iraqi forces, help protect withdrawing forces, and work on counter-terrorism until December 15, 2011, when the war was declared formally over and the last troops <span>left the country</span>. At the same time, Obama increased American involvement in Afghanistan, starting a surge strategy using an additional 30,000 troops, while proposing to begin <span>withdrawing troops</span> sometime in December 2014. With regards to Guantanamo Bay, President Obama forbade <span>torture</span> but in general retained Bush's policy regarding the Guantanamo detainees, while also proposing that the prison eventually be closed.</p>\n <p>In May 2011, after nearly a decade in hiding, the founder and leader of Al Qaeda, <span>Osama bin Laden</span>, was killed in Pakistan in a raid conducted by U.S. naval special forces acting under President Obama's direct orders. While Al Qaeda was near collapse in Afghanistan, affiliated organizations continued to operate in <span>Yemen</span> and other remote areas as the <span>CIA</span> used <span>drones</span> to hunt down and remove its leadership.</p>\n <p>The Boston Marathon Bombing was a bombing incident, followed by subsequent related shootings, that occurred when two pressure cooker bombs exploded during the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. The bombs exploded about 12 seconds and 210 yards (190 m) apart at 2:49 pm EDT, near the marathon's finish line on Boylston Street. They killed 3 people and injured an estimated 264 others. </p>\n <p>The <span>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</span> – formerly known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq – rose to prominence in September 2014. In addition to taking control of much of Western Iraq and Eastern Syria, ISIS also beheaded three journalists, two American and one British. These events lead to <span>a major military offensive</span> by the United States and its allies in the region. </p>\n <p>On December 28, 2014, President Obama officially ended the combat mission in Afghanistan and promised a withdrawal of all remaining U.S. troops at the end of 2016 with the exception of the embassy guards.</p>\n <h3 no-attr=empty> <span>The Great Recession</span><span><span>[</span><span>edit</span><span>]</span></span> </h3> <div role=note>Main article: <span>Great Recession</span> </div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/S7z4w6JY52d8HVCEFSKjPdo6sGMj7OYf9EJsA301HeMrwsiFjWdyZg==/wiki/History_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/e--HW-yLByr2K-U1DtjtYCqSno-sWSo6O0N3UUj7eg1fiaZU8IjxRqJlIyU=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Obama_meets_with_Congressional_Leadership_July_2011.jpg/250px-Obama_meets_with_Congressional_Leadership_July_2011.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Congressional leadership meeting with then-President Obama in 2011.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>In September 2008, the United States, and most of Europe, entered the longest post–World War II <span>recession</span>, often called the \"Great Recession\". Multiple overlapping crises were involved, especially the <span>housing market crisis</span>, a <span>subprime mortgage crisis</span>, <span>soaring oil prices</span>, an <span>automotive industry crisis</span>, rising unemployment, and the worst <span>financial crisis</span> since the <span>Great Depression</span>. The financial crisis threatened the stability of the entire economy in September 2008 when <span>Lehman Brothers</span> failed and other giant banks were in grave danger.

Obama, like Bush, took steps to rescue the auto industry and prevent future economic meltdowns. These included a bailout of <span>General Motors</span> and <span>Chrysler</span>, putting ownership temporarily in the hands of the government, and the \"<span>cash for clunkers</span>\" program which temporarily boosted new car sales.</p>\n <div><div> <div><audio controls preload=none data-durationhint=1137.6697505669 data-startoffset=0 data-mwtitle=Barack_Obama_inauguration_speech_2009.ogg data-mwprovider=wikimediacommons><source src=//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/3/3d/Barack_Obama_inauguration_speech_2009.ogg/Barack_Obama_inauguration_speech_2009.ogg.mp3 type=audio/mpeg data-title=MP3 data-shorttitle=MP3 data-transcodekey=mp3 data-width=0 data-height=0 data-bandwidth=172856><source src=//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Barack_Obama_inauguration_speech_2009.ogg type='audio/ogg; codecs=\"vorbis\"' data-title=\"Original Ogg file (233 kbps)\" data-shorttitle=\"Ogg source\" data-width=0 data-height=0 data-bandwidth=233213></audio></div>\n <div>First African American President Barack Obama's inauguration speech, January 2009</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The recession officially ended in June 2009, and the economy slowly began to expand once again.

Following the <span>2010 midterm elections</span>, which resulted in a Republican-controlled House of Representatives and a Democratic-controlled Senate, Congress presided over a period of elevated gridlock and heated debates over whether or not to raise the <span>debt ceiling</span>, extend tax cuts for citizens making over $250,000 annually, and many other key issues. These ongoing debates led to President Obama signing the <span>Budget Control Act of 2011</span>. In the Fall of 2012, <span>Mitt Romney</span> challenged Barack Obama for the Presidency. Following Obama's reelection in November 2012, Congress passed the <span>American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012</span> – which resulted in an increase in taxes primarily on those earning the most money. Congressional gridlock continued as Congressional Republicans' call for the repeal of the <span>Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</span> – popularly known as \"Obamacare\" – along with other various demands, resulted in the <span>first government shutdown since the Clinton administration</span> and almost led to the first default on <span>U.S. debt</span> since the 19th century. As a result of growing public frustration with both parties in Congress since the beginning of the decade, Congressional approval ratings fell to record lows, with only 11% of Americans approving as of October 2013.</p>\n <p>Other major events that have occurred during the 2010s include the rise of new political movements, such as the <span>conservative</span><span>Tea Party movement</span> and the <span>liberal</span><span>Occupy movement</span>.

States government does not collect religious data in its census. The survey below, the <span>American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS)</span> 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone <span>survey</span> of 54,461 American residential households in the <span>contiguous United States</span>. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281. </p>\n <p>Adult respondents were asked the <span>open-ended question</span>, \"What is your religion, if any?\". Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was \"Protestant\" or \"Christian\" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one-third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions. </p>\n <p><b>Religious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008</b><br>\nFigures are not adjusted

The boom subdivided cohorts may be considered as \"pre-peak\" (including peak year) and \"post-peak\". The year 1957 was the baby boom peak with 4.3 million births and 122.7 fertility rate. Although post-peak births (such as trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and sometimes referred to as a \"bust\", there are still a <i>relatively</i> large number of births. The dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year, and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate. The baby boom began around 1943 to 1946.<sup>[<i><span><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The trend in birth rates from 1958 to 1961 show a tendency to end late in the decade at approximately 1969, thus returning to pre-WWII levels, with 12 years of rising and 12 years of declining birth rates. Pre-war birth rates were defined as anywhere between 1939 and 1941 by demographers such as the Taeuber's, Philip M.

The president directs the <span>executive branch</span> of the <span>federal government</span> and is the <span>commander-in-chief</span> of the <span>United States Armed Forces</span>. </p>\n <p>In contemporary times, the president is looked upon as one of the world's most powerful political figures as the leader of the only remaining global <span>superpower</span>.<sup><span>[13]</span></sup><sup><span>[14]</span></sup><sup><span>[15]</span></sup> The role includes responsibility for the world's <span>most expensive military</span>, which has the <span>second largest nuclear arsenal</span>. The president also leads the nation with the <span>largest economy by nominal GDP</span>. The president possesses significant domestic and international <span>hard</span> and <span>soft power</span>. </p>\n <p><span>Article II of the Constitution</span> establishes the executive branch of the federal government. It vests the executive power of the United States in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law, alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the <span>advice and consent</span> of the <span>Senate</span>. The president is further empowered to grant federal <span>pardons and reprieves</span>, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of <span>Congress</span> under extraordinary circumstances.<sup><span>[16]</span></sup> The president directs the foreign and domestic policies of the United States, and takes an active role in promoting his policy priorities to members of Congress.<sup><span>[17]</span></sup> In addition, as part of the system of <span>checks and balances</span>, <span>Article I, Section 7</span> of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or <span>veto</span> federal legislation. The power of the presidency has grown substantially since its formation, as has the power of the federal government as a whole.<sup><span>[18]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Through the <span>Electoral College</span>, registered voters <span>indirectly elect</span> the president and <span>vice president</span> to a four-year term.

The <span>Twenty-second Amendment</span> states that no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In all, <span>44 individuals</span> have served 45 presidencies spanning 57 full four-year terms.<span>Grover Cleveland</span> served two non-consecutive terms, so he is counted twice, as both the 22nd and 24th president.</p>\n <p><span>Donald Trump</span> of <span>New York</span> is the 45th and current president of the United States. He <span>assumed office</span> on January 20, 2017. </p>\n <div><div lang=en dir=ltr><h2>Contents</h2></div>\n</div>\n <h2><span>Origin</span></h2> <p>In July 1776, during the <span>American Revolutionary War</span>, the <span>Thirteen Colonies</span>, acting jointly through the <span>Second Continental Congress</span>, declared themselves to be 13 independent <span>sovereign states</span>, no longer under <span>British</span> rule. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British, the Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the <span>states</span> together. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government. Congress finished work on the <span>Articles of Confederation</span> to establish a <span>perpetual union</span> between the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for <span>ratification</span>.</p>\n <p>Under the Articles, which <span>took effect</span> on March 1, 1781, the <span>Congress of the Confederation</span> was a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens. This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of <span>Crown</span> and <span>Parliament</span> ought to have functioned with respect to the royal <span>dominion</span>: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire. The states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly <span>royal prerogatives</span> (<i>e.g.</i>, making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a <span>president of the United States in Congress Assembled</span> to preside over its deliberation as a neutral <span>discussion moderator</span>. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position without much influence.</p>\n <p>In 1783, the <span>Treaty of Paris</span> secured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs. By 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their <span>hard currency</span> pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their <span>Mediterranean</span> commerce preyed upon by <span>North African</span><span>pirates</span>, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest. Civil and political unrest loomed. </p>\n <p>Following the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between <span>Virginia</span> and Maryland at the <span>Mount Vernon Conference</span> in 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in <span>Annapolis, Maryland</span>, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the <span>convention</span> failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, <span>Alexander Hamilton</span> led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in <span>Philadelphia</span>. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until <span>James Madison</span> and <span>Edmund Randolph</span> succeeded in securing <span>George Washington</span>'s attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.</p>\n <p>When the <span>Constitutional Convention</span> convened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (<span>Rhode Island</span> did not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.<span>New York</span> offered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter. It was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the <span>U.S. Constitution</span> emerged. </p>\n <h2><span>Powers and duties</span></h2> <div role=note>Main article: <span>Powers of the president of the United States</span> </div>\n <h3><span>Article I legislative role</span></h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/U_7cG1200Ge5zwhlVBoR0fMgamBWWWv1YAVOJiR2RzuNj8d2a_A8GA==/wiki/President_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/QUpf5YmS_6_o6npzG2Qs9x7MzcSbbawzAcYG-24w8kBmoj8Rmi_4HQ7ahSw=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Reagan_signs_Martin_Luther_King_bill.jpg/220px-Reagan_signs_Martin_Luther_King_bill.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>President <span>Ronald Reagan</span> signs the <span>Martin Luther King bill</span>, 1983.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/ESFT1QgWKKlS3VP2apSTL1C77CyX6fApkP8sVsEoHV-12DbSJDcP3Q==/wiki/President_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/egjhGxtH6PKVZkSIzYNMSxs1VV1u6bubXCWNyn3fa3-uLb-nell0S97RQQ8=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/SOU2007.jpg/220px-SOU2007.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>President <span>George W.

Once the legislation has been presented, the president has three options: </p>\n <ol> <li>Sign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays – the bill <span>becomes law</span>.</li>\n <li> <span>Veto</span> the legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections – the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a <span>two-thirds vote</span>.</li>\n <li>Take no action on the legislation within the above timeframe – the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law (a <span>pocket veto</span>).</li>\n </ol> <p>The president can also be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting or even insisting that Congress enact laws he believes are needed. Additionally, he can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress. Presidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.<span>Article I, Section 1</span> of the Constitution, bolstered by <span>Article I, Section 8</span>, puts all <span>lawmaking power</span> in Congress's hands, and <span>Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2</span> prevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress. </p>\n <p>The president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. The president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally (e.g. <span>Article II, Section 3</span>) or statutorily mandated periodic reports to Congress. These reports may be either written or oral, but today the greatest in importance is given as the oral <span>State of the Union</span> addresses, which often outline the president's legislative proposals for the coming year. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.</p>\n <p>In the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of <span>agencies</span> that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \"virtual army of 'czars' – each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\".<sup><span>[30]</span></sup> Presidents have been criticized for making <span>signing statements</span> when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.<sup><span>[31]</span></sup> This practice has been criticized by the <span>American Bar Association</span> as unconstitutional. Conservative commentator <span>George Will</span> wrote of an \"increasingly swollen executive branch\" and \"the eclipse of Congress\".<sup><span>[33]</span></sup></p>\n <h3><span>Article II executive powers</span></h3> <h4><span>War and foreign affairs powers</span></h4> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/cwgCGKWw8E301jSf39SQmThtPOTC0R8Yo_1gWp8rrEkKxOvzioqPDA==/wiki/President_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/RUzz8k5rP5L4hxlmncA4BYFaq5IN3eokP5mMETs17kkCJbkXjq_wolWKYiE=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Abraham_Lincoln_head_on_shoulders_photo_portrait.jpg/200px-Abraham_Lincoln_head_on_shoulders_photo_portrait.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>Abraham Lincoln</span>, the 16th president of the United States, successfully preserved the <span>Union</span> during the <span>American Civil War</span>.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>One of the most important of executive powers is the president's role as <span>commander-in-chief</span> of the <span>United States Armed Forces</span>. The power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate responsibility for the direction and disposition of the military. The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority.<sup><span>[34]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The amount of military detail handled personally by the president in wartime has varied greatly.<sup><span>[35]</span></sup><span>George Washington</span>, the first U.S. president, firmly established <span>military subordination under civilian authority</span>. In 1794, Washington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the <span>Whiskey Rebellion</span>—a conflict in western Pennsylvania involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay an excise tax on spirits. According to historian <span>Joseph Ellis</span>, this was the \"first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\", though <span>James Madison</span> briefly took control of artillery units in <span>defense of Washington, D.C.,</span> during the <span>War of 1812</span>.<sup><span>[36]</span></sup><span>Abraham Lincoln</span> was deeply involved in overall strategy and in day-to-day operations during the <span>American Civil War</span>, 1861–1865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to select and encourage commanders such as <span>Ulysses S. Grant</span>.<sup><span>[37]</span></sup></p>\n <p> The present-day operational command of the Armed Forces is delegated to the <span>Department of Defense</span> and is normally exercised through the <span>secretary of defense</span>. The <span>chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</span> and the <span>Combatant Commands</span> assist with the operation as outlined in the presidentially approved Unified Command Plan (UCP).<sup><span>[38]</span></sup><sup><span>[39]</span></sup><sup><span>[40]</span></sup> The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; <span>Alexander Hamilton</span> explained this in <span>Federalist No. 69</span>:</p>\n <blockquote><p>The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States. ... It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces ... while that [the power] of the <span>British king</span> extends to the DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all [of] which ... would appertain to the legislature.<sup><span>[41]</span></sup> [Emphasis in the original.] </p>\n</blockquote> <p> Pursuant to the <span>War Powers Resolution</span>, Congress must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual. Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. Presidents have historically initiated the process for going to war,<sup><span>[43]</span></sup><sup><span>[44]</span></sup> but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including <span>Theodore Roosevelt</span>'s military move into <span>Panama</span> in 1903,<sup><span>[43]</span></sup> the <span>Korean War</span>,<sup><span>[43]</span></sup> the <span>Vietnam War</span>,<sup><span>[43]</span></sup> and the invasions of <span>Grenada</span> in 1983<sup><span>[45]</span></sup> and <span>Panama</span> in 1989.<sup><span>[46]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The Constitution also empowers the president to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements between the United States and other countries. Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a <span>two-thirds majority</span> vote), become binding with the force of federal law. </p>\n <h4><span>Administrative powers</span></h4> <div> <div>Suffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.</div>\n <p><cite><i><span>Nixon v. General Services Administration</span></i>, (<span>Rehnquist, J.</span>, <span>dissenting</span>)</cite></p>\n </div>\n <p>The president is head of the executive branch of the federal government and is <span>constitutionally obligated</span> to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\".<sup><span>[47]</span></sup> The executive branch has over four million employees, including the military.<sup><span>[48]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Presidents make numerous executive branch appointments: an incoming president may make up to 6,000 before taking office and 8,000 more while serving. <span>Ambassadors</span>, members of the <span>Cabinet</span>, and other federal officers, are all appointed by a president with the \"<span>advice and consent</span>\" of a majority of the Senate. When the Senate is in recess for at least ten days, the president may make <span>recess appointments</span>.<sup><span>[49]</span></sup> Recess appointments are temporary and expire at the end of the next session of the Senate. </p>\n <p>The power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue. Generally, a president may remove executive officials purely at will.<sup><span>[50]</span></sup> However, Congress can curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by <span>statute</span>.<sup><span>[51]</span></sup></p>\n <p>To manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the <span>Executive Office of the President of the United States</span>. Within the Executive Office, the president's innermost layer of aides (and their assistants) are located in the <span>White House Office</span>. </p>\n <p>To allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by <span>Article II, Section 3</span> of the Constitution to call a <span>special session</span> of one our both houses of Congress. Since <span>John Adams</span> first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. <span>Harry Truman</span> was the most recent to do so in July 1948 (the so-called \"<span>Turnip Day Session</span>\"). In addition, prior to ratification of the <span>Twentieth Amendment</span> in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly <span>inaugurated</span> presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this administrative power.<sup><span>[53]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The president also possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government through issuing various types of directives, such as <span>presidential proclamation</span> and <span>executive orders</span>. When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.<sup><span>[54]</span></sup> Even so, these directives are subject to <span>judicial review</span> by U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional. Moreover, Congress can overturn an executive order through legislation (e.g., <span>Congressional Review Act</span>). </p>\n <h4><span>Juridical powers</span></h4> <p>The president has power to nominate <span>federal judges</span>, including members of the <span>United States courts of appeals</span> and the <span>Supreme Court of the United States</span>. However, these nominations require <span>Senate confirmation</span> before they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to <span>U.S. district courts</span>, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of <span>senatorial courtesy</span>. Presidents may also grant <span>pardons</span> and <span>reprieves</span>. <span>Gerald Ford</span> pardoned <span>Richard Nixon</span> a month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when Bill Clinton pardoned <span>Patty Hearst</span> on his last day in office; this is often <span>controversial</span>.<sup><span>[55]</span></sup><sup><span>[56]</span></sup><sup><span>[57]</span></sup></p>\n <div role=note>For further information, see <span>List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States</span>.</div>\n <h3><span>Ceremonial roles</span></h3> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/_HvIN2hVxEHqHjsmaPASyCxGpe5rQhqm9AZxHkltOPIApnlSmWnwTQ==/wiki/President_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/CtThV4P-CiVILliAK0yeD7wEIT8Y2zLlUiKUDMLK8B-b6QF5hal5_Om4l20=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Wilson_opening_day_1916.jpg/220px-Wilson_opening_day_1916.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>President <span>Woodrow Wilson</span> throws out the ceremonial first ball on <span>Opening Day</span>, 1916</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>The president fulfills many ceremonial duties. <span>William Howard Taft</span> started the tradition of throwing out the <span>ceremonial first pitch</span> in 1910 at <span>Griffith Stadium</span>, Washington, D.C., on the <span>Washington Senators's</span><span>Opening Day</span>. Every president since Taft, except for <span>Jimmy Carter</span>, threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening Day, the <span>All-Star Game</span>, or the <span>World Series</span>, usually with much fanfare.<sup><span>[66]</span></sup> Every president since <span>Theodore Roosevelt</span> has served as honorary president of the <span>Boy Scouts of America</span>.<sup><span>[67]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Other presidential traditions are associated with American holidays. <span>Rutherford B. Hayes</span> began in 1878 the first White House <span>egg rolling</span> for local children.<sup><span>[68]</span></sup> Beginning in 1947, during the <span>Harry S. Truman</span> administration, every <span>Thanksgiving</span> the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual <span>National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation</span> held at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of \"pardoning\" the turkey was formalized by <span>George H. W. Bush</span>, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.<sup><span>[69]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Presidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government.

Kennedy</span> in 1961. This is followed by a <span>state dinner</span> given by the president which is held in the <span>State Dining Room</span> later in the evening.<sup><span>[73]</span></sup></p>\n <p>The modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration <span>public relations</span> officials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \"propagandized leadership\" which has a \"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\".<sup><span>[74]</span></sup> Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted <span>photo-ops</span> of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.<sup><span>[75]</span></sup> One critic wrote the image of <span>John F. Kennedy</span> was described as carefully framed \"in rich detail\" which \"drew on the power of myth\" regarding the incident of <span>PT 109</span><sup><span>[76]</span></sup> and wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.<sup><span>[77]</span></sup> As a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\".<sup><span>[78]</span></sup></p>\n <h3><span>Critics of presidency's evolution</span></h3> <div role=note>Main articles: <span>Imperial Presidency</span> and <span>Imperiled Presidency</span> </div>\n <p>The nation's <span>Founding Fathers</span> expected the <span>Congress</span>—which was the first branch of government described in the <span>Constitution</span>—to be the dominant branch of government; they did not expect a strong executive department.<sup><span>[79]</span></sup> However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful,<sup><span>[80]</span></sup><sup><span>[81]</span></sup> unchecked, unbalanced, and \"monarchist\" in nature.<sup><span>[83]</span></sup> Professor <span>Dana D. Nelson</span> believes presidents over the past thirty years have worked towards \"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\".<sup><span>[84]</span></sup> She criticizes proponents of the <span>unitary executive</span> for expanding \"the many existing uncheckable executive powers – such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements – that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress\".<sup><span>[84]</span></sup><span>Bill Wilson</span>, board member of <span>Americans for Limited Government</span>, opined that the expanded presidency was \"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\".<sup><span>[85]</span></sup></p>\n <h2><span>Selection process</span></h2> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/WRJl14aLihZz-UC3Dlw_7fSeQzxLM89WHuUE2o3Znc2HhvJ2o6wTHA==/wiki/President_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/qBTm0GGgHvmKmAog_vgVlCyXdBc9zLbDPcf5uWMdQQmS1lIFCEAWxT4pYhY=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Gilbert_Stuart_Williamstown_Portrait_of_George_Washington.jpg/200px-Gilbert_Stuart_Williamstown_Portrait_of_George_Washington.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>George Washington</span>, the first president of the United States</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <h3><span>Eligibility</span></h3> <p><span>Article II, Section 1, Clause 5</span> of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency.

Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is <span>rubber-stamped</span> by the convention. The most common previous profession of U.S. presidents is lawyer.<sup><span>[91]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Nominees participate in <span>nationally televised debates</span>, and while the debates are usually restricted to the <span>Democratic</span> and <span>Republican</span> nominees, third party candidates may be invited, such as <span>Ross Perot</span> in the 1992 debates. Nominees campaign across the country to explain their views, convince voters and solicit contributions.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the <span>Twenty-third Amendment</span> provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state. Currently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election held on <span>Election Day</span>.<sup><span>[93]</span></sup> In all but two states, the party whose presidential-vice presidential <span>ticket</span> receives a <span>plurality</span> of popular votes in the state has its entire <span>slate</span> of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.<sup><span>[94]</span></sup><span>Maine</span> and <span>Nebraska</span> deviate from this <span>winner-take-all</span> practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each <span>congressional district</span>.<sup><span>[95]</span></sup><sup><span>[96]</span></sup></p>\n <p>On the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the <span>party</span> that nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 30 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are <span>pledged</span>.<sup><span>[93]</span></sup><sup><span>[97]</span></sup> Following the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an <span>absolute majority</span> of electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the <span>House of Representatives</span> must meet to elect a president using a <span>contingent election</span> procedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top electoral vote-getters for president. For a candidate to win, he or she must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).<sup><span>[93]</span></sup></p>\n <p>There have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73–73 electoral vote tie between <span>Thomas Jefferson</span> and fellow Democratic-Republican <span>Aaron Burr</span> in the <span>election of 1800</span> necessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by <span>Article II, Section 1, Clause 3</span> of the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the <span>runner-up</span> would become vice president.<sup><span>[98]</span></sup> On February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr became vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the Twelfth Amendment in time to be used in the <span>1804 election</span>.<sup><span>[99]</span></sup> A quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the <span>election of 1824</span>. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients: <span>Andrew Jackson</span>, <span>John Quincy Adams</span>, and <span>William H. Crawford</span>. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.<sup><span>[100]</span></sup></p>\n <h2><span>Tenure</span></h2> <h3><span>Inauguration</span></h3> <div role=note>Main article: <span>United States presidential inauguration</span> </div>\n <p>Pursuant to the <span>Twentieth Amendment</span>, the four-year term of office for both the president and vice president begins at noon on January 20.<sup><span>[101]</span></sup> The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as <span>Inauguration Day</span>, were the <span>second terms</span> of President <span>Franklin D. Roosevelt</span> and Vice President <span>John Nance Garner</span> in 1937. Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933–37) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.<sup><span>[103]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Before executing the powers of the office, a president is required to <span>recite</span> the <span>presidential oath of office</span>, found in <span>Article II, Section 1, Clause 8</span>. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution: </p>\n <blockquote><p>I do solemnly swear (or <span>affirm</span>) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.<sup><span>[104]</span></sup></p>\n</blockquote> <p>Presidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a <span>Bible</span> while taking the oath, and have added \"So help me God\" to the end of the oath.<sup><span>[105]</span></sup><sup><span>[106]</span></sup> Although the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the <span>chief justice of the United States</span>.<sup><span>[104]</span></sup></p>\n <h3><span>Term limit</span></h3> <p>When the first president, George Washington, announced in his <i><span>Farewell Address</span></i> that he was not running for a third term, he established a \"two-terms then out\" precedent. Precedent became tradition after <span>Thomas Jefferson</span> publicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors, <span>James Madison</span> and <span>James Monroe</span>.<sup><span>[107]</span></sup> In spite of the strong two-term tradition, <span>Ulysses S. Grant</span> sought a non-consecutive third term in 1880,<sup><span>[108]</span></sup> as did <span>Theodore Roosevelt</span> in 1912 (though it would have been only his second full term).<sup><span>[109]</span></sup> Both were unsuccessful. </p>\n <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/9iNClNp1FqezvOdM5cyNFLlt38v3gWhwg7pxDtzKoVkDy180cde_2g==/wiki/President_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/ubHixeR3uhkJtfI2nOxSDTpr9HBOqjeN77id-RBP4uW4Tja4kU88ab6DLiU=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/FDR_in_1933.jpg/200px-FDR_in_1933.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div> <span>Franklin D.

Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in <span>World War II</span>, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.<sup><span>[110]</span></sup></p>\n <p>In response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the <span>Twenty-second Amendment</span> was <span>adopted</span> in 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term. <span>Harry S. Truman</span>, president when this <span>term limit</span> came into force, was exempted from its limitations, and briefly sought a second full term—to which he would have otherwise been ineligible for election, as he had been president for more than two years of Roosevelt's fourth term—before he withdrew from the <span>1952 election</span>.<sup><span>[110]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Since the amendment's adoption, five presidents have served two full terms: <span>Dwight D. Eisenhower</span>, <span>Ronald Reagan</span>, <span>Bill Clinton</span>, <span>George W. Bush</span>, and <span>Barack Obama</span>. Both <span>Jimmy Carter</span> and <span>George H. W. Bush</span> sought a second term but were defeated. <span>Richard Nixon</span> was elected to a second term, but resigned before completing it. <span>Lyndon B. Johnson</span>, having held the presidency for one full term in addition to only 14 months of <span>John F. Kennedy</span>'s unexpired term, was eligible for a second full term in 1968, but <span>withdrew from Democratic Primary</span>. Additionally, <span>Gerald Ford</span>, who served out the last two years and five months of Nixon's second term, sought a full term but was defeated by Jimmy Carter in the <span>1976 election</span>. </p>\n <h3><span>Impeachment</span></h3> <div role=note>Further information: <span>Impeachment in the United States</span> </div>\n <p><span>Article II, Section 4</span> of the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \"<span>treason</span>, <span>bribery</span>, or other <span>high crimes and misdemeanors</span>.\" <span>Article I, Section 2, Clause 5</span> authorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \"<span>grand jury</span>\" with the power to <span>impeach</span> said officials by a majority vote.<sup><span>[111]</span></sup><span>Article I, Section 3, Clause 6</span> authorizes the Senate to serve as a <span>court</span> with the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.</p>\n <p>Two presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: <span>Andrew Johnson</span> in <span>1868</span>, and Bill Clinton in <span>1998</span>. Both were acquitted by the Senate: Johnson by one vote, and Clinton by 17 votes. Additionally, the <span>House Judiciary Committee</span> commenced impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon in <span>1974</span>; however, he resigned from office before the full House voted on the articles of impeachment.<sup><span>[111]</span></sup></p>\n <h2><span>Succession and disability</span></h2> <p>Vacancies and succession in the office of president may arise under several possible circumstances: death, resignation, and <span>removal from office</span>. Deaths have occurred a number of times, a resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred. </p>\n <p>The Constitution, in <span>Article II, Section 1, Clause 6</span>, stipulates that the vice president takes over the \"powers and duties\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.<sup><span>[113]</span></sup> Even so, it does not clearly state whether the vice president would become President of the United States or simply <span>act</span> as president in a case of succession.<sup><span>[114]</span></sup> This ambiguity was alleviated in 1967 by <span>Section 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment</span>, which unequivocally states that the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or resignation of the president. </p>\n <p>Under <span>Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment</span>, the president may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes <span>acting president</span>, by transmitting a statement to the <span>Speaker of the House</span> and the <span>president <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate</span> stating the reasons for the transfer. The president resumes the discharge of the presidential powers and duties upon transmitting, to those two officials, a written declaration stating that resumption. Such a transfer of power has occurred on three occasions: <span>Ronald Reagan</span> to <span>George H. W. Bush</span> once, on July 13, 1985, and <span>George W. Bush</span> to <span>Dick Cheney</span> twice, on June 29, 2002, and on July 21, 2007.<sup><span>[115]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Under <span>Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment</span>, the vice president, in conjunction with a majority of the <span>Cabinet</span>, may transfer the presidential powers and duties from the president to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration to the Speaker of the House and the president <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate that the president is <span>incapacitated</span>—unable to discharge their presidential powers and duties. If this occurs, then the vice president will assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president; however, the president can declare that no such inability exists and resume the discharge of the presidential powers and duties. If the vice president and Cabinet contest this claim, it is up to Congress, which must meet within two days if not already in session, to decide the merit of the claim. </p>\n <p>Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President.\"<sup><span>[114]</span></sup> The <span>Presidential Succession Act of 1947</span>, (codified as <span>3 U.S.C.</span><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/19 target=_blank>§ 19</a>) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the <span>presidential line of succession</span> follows the order of: Speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of <span>federal executive departments</span> who form the president's <span>Cabinet</span>. The Cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those department heads who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.<sup><span>[116]</span></sup></p>\n <h2><span>Political affiliation</span></h2> <p><span>Political parties</span> have dominated <span>American politics</span> for most of the nation's history. Though the <span>Founding Fathers</span> generally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid–1790s nonetheless.

The site was selected by George Washington, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792. Every president since John Adams (in 1800) has lived there. At various times in U.S. history, it has been known as the \"President's Palace,\" the \"President's House,\" and the \"Executive Mansion.\" Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901. Facilities that are available to the president include access to the White House staff, medical care, recreation, housekeeping, and security services. The federal government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food.</p>\n <p><span>Camp David</span>, officially titled Naval Support Facility Thurmont, a mountain-based military camp in <span>Frederick County, Maryland</span>, is the president's country residence. A place of solitude and tranquility, the site has been used extensively to host foreign dignitaries since the 1940s.</p>\n <p><span>Blair House</span>, located next to the <span>Eisenhower Executive Office Building</span> at the White House Complex and <span>Lafayette Park</span>, serves as the president's official guest house and as a secondary residence for the president if needed. Four interconnected, 19th century houses—Blair House, Lee House, and 700 and 704 Jackson Place—with a combined floor space exceeding 70,000 square feet (6,500 m<sup>2</sup>) comprise the property.</p>\n <h2><span>Travel</span></h2> <div role=note>Main article: <span>Transportation of the President of the United States</span> </div>\n <p>The primary means of long-distance air travel for the president is one of two identical <span>Boeing VC-25</span> aircraft, which are extensively modified <span>Boeing 747</span> airliners and are referred to as <i><span>Air Force One</span></i> while the president is on board (although any U.S. Air Force aircraft the president is aboard is designated as \"Air Force One\" for the duration of the flight). In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the <span>Boeing C-32</span>, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet. Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated <span>Executive One</span> for the flight.<sup><span>[130]</span></sup><sup><span>[131]</span></sup></p>\n <p>For short-distance air travel, the president has access to a fleet of <span>U.S. Marine Corps</span> helicopters of varying models, designated <i><span>Marine One</span></i> when the president is aboard any particular one in the fleet. Flights are typically handled with as many as five helicopters all flying together and frequently swapping positions as to disguise which helicopter the president is actually aboard to any would-be threats. </p>\n <p>For ground travel, the president uses the <span>presidential state car</span>, which is an armored <span>limousine</span> designed to look like a <span>Cadillac</span> sedan, but built on a truck <span>chassis</span>.<sup><span>[133]</span></sup> The <span>US Secret Service</span> operates and maintains the fleet of several limousines. The president also has access to <span>two armored motorcoaches</span>, which are primarily used for <span>touring trips</span>.<sup><span>[134]</span></sup></p>\n <h2><span>Protection</span></h2> <p>The <span>U.S. Secret Service</span> is charged with protecting the president and the <span>first family</span>. As part of their protection, presidents, <span>first ladies</span>, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned <span>Secret Service codenames</span>.<sup><span>[135]</span></sup> The use of such names was originally for security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic communications were not routinely <span>encrypted</span>; today, the names simply serve for purposes of brevity, clarity, and tradition.<sup><span>[136]</span></sup></p>\n <h2><span>Post-presidency</span></h2> <div><div> <span><img src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=http://www.eelsgo.com/tunnel/BCByBKR4THkvI89Z17YuigIEf2H2NhejGV4pRZ-h75P9Q-8eYLxGSg==/wiki/President_of_the_United_States__-__/tunnel/0Y5OEMHLrMjFXpQFF7aS2wY5nkzo91Ni4_MWx7RDkrUSUG3_nZ75AFbDlrc=/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Five_Presidents_Oval_Office.jpg/260px-Five_Presidents_Oval_Office.jpg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"></span><div>Four presidents and one then-president-elect.

Photo taken in the <span>Oval Office</span> on January 7, 2009; Obama formally took office thirteen days later.</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n <p>Under the <span>Former Presidents Act</span>, all living former presidents are granted a pension, an office, and a staff. The pension has increased numerous times with Congressional approval. Retired presidents now receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 each year in 2012.<sup><span>[137]</span></sup> Former presidents who served in Congress may also collect <span>congressional pensions</span>.<sup><span>[138]</span></sup> The act also provides former presidents with travel funds and <span>franking</span> privileges. Prior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.<sup><span>[139]</span></sup><sup><span>[140]</span></sup> In 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.<sup><span>[141]</span></sup> On January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him, <span>George W. Bush</span>, and all subsequent presidents. A spouse who remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.<sup><span>[141]</span></sup></p>\n <p>Some presidents have had significant careers after leaving office. Prominent examples include <span>William Howard Taft</span>'s tenure as <span>Chief Justice of the United States</span> and <span>Herbert Hoover</span>'s work on government reorganization after <span>World War II</span>. <span>Grover Cleveland</span>, whose bid for reelection failed in 1888, was elected president again four years later in 1892. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House: <span>John Quincy Adams</span> was elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for seventeen years, and <span>Andrew Johnson</span> returned to the Senate in 1875. <span>John Tyler</span> served in the provisional <span>Congress of the Confederate States</span> during the <span>Civil War</span> and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives, but died before that body first met. </p>\n <p>As of July 2019, there are four <span>living former U.S. presidents</span>. The most recent former president to die was <span>George H. W. Bush</span> (1989–1993), on November 30, 2018.

Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the <span>National Archives and Records Administration</span> (NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.<sup><span>[146]</span></sup> There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, such as the <span>Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum</span>, which is run by the State of <span>Illinois</span>, the <span>George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum</span>, which is run by <span>Southern Methodist University</span>, the <span>George H. W.

Some have even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document, including the <span>Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home</span> in <span>Abilene, Kansas</span>, <span>Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum</span> in <span>Yorba Linda, California</span>, and the <span>Ronald Reagan Presidential Library</span> in <span>Simi Valley, California</span>.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 contains only vague consultation requirements. Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \"pursuant\" to these triggering provisions.</q></cite></span> </li>\n <li> <span>^ <span><sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup></span><span><sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup></span><span><sup><i><b>c</b></i></sup></span><span><sup><i><b>d</b></i></sup></span></span><span><cite><a rel=nofollow href=https://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878290,00.html target=_blank>\"The Law: The President's War Powers\"</a>. <i>Time</i>.

Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege.
