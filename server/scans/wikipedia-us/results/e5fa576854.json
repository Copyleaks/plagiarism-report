The capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half the country’s 4 million people.[3]\n Panama was inhabited by indigenous tribes before Spanish colonists arrived in the 16th century. It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia, a union of Nueva Granada, Ecuador, and Venezuela. After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831, Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia. With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. The 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties led to the transfer of the Canal from the United States to Panama on December 31, 1999.[9]\n Revenue from canal tolls continues to represent a significant portion of Panama’s GDP, although commerce, banking, and tourism are major and growing sectors. In 2015 Panama ranked 60th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index.[10] Since 2010, Panama has been the second-most competitive economy in Latin America, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index. Covering around 40 percent of its land area, Panama’s jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals – some of them found nowhere else on the planet.[11] Panama is a founding member of the United Nations and other international organizations such as OAS, LAIA, G77, WHO and NAM. \n   Contents  \n \n   1 Etymology \n  2 History   2.1 Pre-Columbian period \n  2.2 Conquest to 1799   2.2.1 1800s \n  \n  2.3 Post-colonial Panama   2.3.1 Post-1970 \n  2.3.2 US invasion (1989) \n  \n  2.4 Post-intervention era \n  \n  3 Geography   3.1 Waterways \n  3.2 Harbors \n  3.3 Climate \n  \n  4 Politics   4.1 Political culture \n  4.2 Foreign relations \n  4.3 Military \n  4.4 Administrative divisions \n  \n  5 Economy   5.1 Economic sectors \n  5.2 Panama as an IFC \n  5.3 Transportation \n  5.4 Tourism \n  5.5 Currency \n  5.6 International trade \n  \n  6 Society   6.1 Demographics \n  6.2 Ethnic groups \n  6.3 Languages \n  6.4 Largest cities \n  6.5 Religion \n  6.6 Education \n  \n  7 Culture   7.1 Handicraft \n  7.2 Holidays and festivities \n  7.3 Traditional cuisine \n  7.4 Traditional clothing \n  7.5 Literature \n  7.6 Sports \n  \n  8 See also \n  9 References \n  10 Further reading \n  11 External links \n  \n  Etymology[edit]\n  The definite origin of the name Panama is ultimately unknown. There are several theories. One postulates that the country was named after a commonly found species of tree (Sterculia apetala, the Panama tree). Another that the first settlers arrived in Panama in August, when butterflies abound, and that the name means “many butterflies” in one or several of indigenous Amerindian languages that were spoken in the territory prior to Spanish colonization. Most scientifically corroborated theory, that by Panamanian linguists, states that the word is a hispanicization of Kuna language word “bannaba” which means “distant” or “far away”.[12]\n A commonly relayed legend in Panama is that there was a fishing village that bore the name “Panamá”, which purportedly meant “an abundance of fish”, when the Spanish colonizers first landed in the area. The exact location of the village is unspecified. The legend is usually corroborated by Captain Antonio Tello de Guzmán’s diary entries, who reports landing at an unnamed village while exploring the Pacific coast of Panama in 1515; he only describes the village as a “same small indigenous fishing town”. In 1517, Don Gaspar de Espinosa, a Spanish lieutenant, decided to settle a post in the same location Guzmán described. In 1519, Pedrarias Dávila decided to establish the Spanish Empire’s Pacific port at the site. The new settlement replaced Santa María La Antigua del Darién, which had lost its function within the Crown’s global plan after the Spanish exploitation of the riches in the Pacific began. \n The official definition and origin of the name as promoted by Panama’s Ministry of Education is the “abundance of fish, trees and butterflies”. This is the usual description given in social studies textbooks. \n  History[edit]\n      \n   This section needs additional citations for verification.

These people have nearly disappeared, as they had no immunity from European infectious diseases.[13]\n  Pre-Columbian period[edit]\n      \n Amphibian Pendant, Walters Art Museum \n \n \n \n     \n Embera girl dressed for a dance\n \n \n \n The Isthmus of Panama was formed about three million years ago when the land bridge between North and South America finally became complete, and plants and animals gradually crossed it in both directions. The existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people, agriculture and technology throughout the American continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities.[14][15]\n The earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in Panama include Paleo-Indian projectile points. Later central Panama was home to some of the first pottery-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at Monagrillo, which date back to 2500–1700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500–900 AD) at the Monagrillo archaeological site, and their beautiful Gran Coclé style polychrome pottery. The monumental monolithic sculptures at the Barriles (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures. \n Before Europeans arrived Panama was widely settled by Chibchan, Chocoan, and Cueva peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed[clarification needed] by regular regional routes of commerce. \n When Panama was colonized, the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands. Scholars believe that infectious disease was the primary cause of the population decline of American natives. The indigenous peoples had no acquired immunity to diseases which had been chronic in Eurasian populations for centuries.[16]\n  Conquest to 1799[edit]\n      \n Vasco Núñez de Balboa, a recognized and popular figure of Panamanian history\n \n \n \n     \n “New Caledonia”, the ill-fated Scottish Darien scheme colony in the Bay of Caledonia, west of the Gulf of Darien \n \n \n \n Rodrigo de Bastidas sailed westward from Venezuela in 1501 in search of gold, and became the first European to explore the isthmus of Panama. A year later, Christopher Columbus visited the isthmus, and established a short-lived settlement in the Darien. Vasco Núñez de Balboa’s tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas, and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain’s empire in the New World. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for Spain. The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of Crosses) because of the number of gravesites along the way. \n Panama was under Spanish rule for almost 300 years (1538–1821), and became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of “geographic destiny”, and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned Panamanian nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.[17][page needed]\n In 1538 the Real Audiencia of Panama was established, initially with jurisdiction from Nicaragua to Cape Horn, until the conquest of Peru. A Real Audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court. Each audiencia had an oidor (Spanish: hearer, a judge). \n Spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of Panama. Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as “indios de guerra” (war Indians) who resisted Spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them. However, Panama was enormously important to Spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in Peru to Europe. Silver cargoes were landed at Panama and then taken overland to Portobello or Nombre de Dios on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment. \n Because of incomplete Spanish control, the Panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly Dutch and English), and from “new world” Africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or palenques around the Camino Real in Panama’s Interior, and on some of the islands off Panama’s Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under Bayano, which emerged in the 1552 to 1558. Sir Francis Drake’s famous raids on Panama in 1572–73 and John Oxenham’s crossing to the Pacific Ocean were aided by Panama cimarrons, and Spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.[18]\n The prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540–1740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the Spanish Empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within Panama well before the rest of the colonies. \n The end of the encomienda system in Azuero, however, sparked the conquest of Veraguas in that same year. Under the leadership of Francisco Vázquez, the region of Veraguas passed into Castilian rule in 1558. In the newly conquered region, the old system of encomienda was imposed. On the other hand, the Panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the Azuero Peninsula, set forth by the Spanish Crown, in 1558 because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population. In its stead, a system of medium and smaller-sized landownership was promoted, thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and small-sized proprietors. \n Panama was the site of the ill-fated Darien scheme, which set up a Scottish colony in the region in 1698. This failed for a number of reasons, and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of England and Scotland in 1707.[19]\n In 1671, the privateer Henry Morgan, licensed by the English government, sacked and burned the city of Panama – the second most important city in the Spanish New World at the time. In 1717 the viceroyalty of New Granada (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take Spanish territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of Panama was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada’s capital, Santa Fe de Bogotá (the modern capital of Colombia) proved a greater obstacle than the Spanish crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the viceroyalty of Lima and even by Panama’s own initiative. This uneasy relationship between Panama and Bogotá would persist for centuries. \n In 1744, Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the College of San Ignacio de Loyola and on June 3, 1749, founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier. By this time, however, Panama’s importance and influence had become insignificant as Spain’s power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted ships to round Cape Horn in order to reach the Pacific. While the Panama route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other. \n  1800s[edit]\n      \n Santo Domingo Church \n \n \n \n As the Spanish American wars of independence were heating up all across Latin America, Panama City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of Saints), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of Azuero without backing from Panama City to declare their separation from the Spanish Empire. In both Veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans. \n Nevertheless, the Grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core. It was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in Panama City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from Spain, but also for their right to self-rule apart from Panama City once the Spaniards were gone. \n It was an incredibly brave move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel José Pedro Antonio de Fábrega y de las Cuevas (1774–1841), and with good reason. The Colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus’ military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists. \n What they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, Juan de la Cruz Murgeón, left the isthmus on a campaign in Quito and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting y Fábrega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, Fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, Fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city’s support for independence. No military repercussions occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troops. \n  Post-colonial Panama[edit]\n      \n 1903 political cartoon. The US government, working with separatists in Panama, engineered a Panamanian declaration of independence from Colombia, then sent US warships and marines to Panama.[20] \n \n \n \n See also: Panama–Colombia separation; Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty; Panamanian general election, 1968; and History of Panama (1964–77) \n     \n US President Theodore Roosevelt sitting on a steam shovel at the Panama Canal, 1906\n \n \n \n In the first 80 years following independence from Spain, Panama was a department of Colombia, after voluntarily joining at the end of 1821. \n The people of the isthmus made several attempts to secede and came close to success in 1831, then again during the Thousand Days’ War of 1899–1902, understood among indigenous Panamanians as a struggle for land rights under the leadership of Victoriano Lorenzo.[21]\n The US intent to influence the area, especially the Panama Canal’s construction and control, led to the separation of Panama from Colombia in 1903 and its establishment as a nation. When the Senate of Colombia rejected the Hay–Herrán Treaty on January 22, 1903, the United States decided to support and encourage the Panamanian separatist movement[22][20]\n In November 1903 Panama proclaimed its independence[23] and concluded the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty with the United States. The treaty granted rights to the United States “as if it were sovereign” in a zone roughly 16 km (10 mi) wide and 80 km (50 mi) long. In that zone, the US would build a canal, then administer, fortify, and defend it “in perpetuity”. \n     \n Construction work on the Gaillard Cut of the Panama Canal, 1907\n \n \n \n In 1914 the United States completed the existing 83-kilometre-long (52-mile) canal. \n From 1903 to 1968, Panama was a constitutional democracy dominated by a commercially oriented oligarchy. During the 1950s, the Panamanian military began to challenge the oligarchy’s political hegemony. The early 1960s saw also the beginning of sustained pressure in Panama for the renegotiation of the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, including riots that broke out in early 1964, resulting in widespread looting and dozens of deaths, and the evacuation of the American embassy.[24]\n Amid negotiations for the Robles–Johnson treaty, Panama held elections in 1968. The candidates were \n  Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid, Unión Nacional (“National Union”)\n Antonio González Revilla, Democracia Cristiana (“Christian Democrats”)\n engineer David Samudio, Alianza del Pueblo (“People’s Alliance”) who had the government’s support.\n  [25]\n Arias Madrid was declared the winner of elections that were marked by violence and accusations of fraud against Alianza del Pueblo. On October 1, 1968, Arias Madrid took office as president of Panama, promising to lead a government of “national union” that would end the reigning corruption and pave the way for a new Panama. A week and a half later, on October 11, 1968, the National Guard (Guardia Nacional) ousted Arias and initiated the downward spiral that would culminate with the United States’ invasion in 1989. Arias, who had promised to respect the hierarchy of the National Guard, broke the pact and started a large restructuring of the Guard. To preserve the Guard’s interests, Lieutenant Colonel Omar Torrijos Herrera and Major Boris Martínez commanded the first military coup against a civilian government in Panamanian republican history.[25]\n The military justified itself by declaring that Arias Madrid was trying to install a dictatorship, and promised a return to constitutional rule. In the meantime, the Guard began a series of populist measures that would gain support for the coup. Among them were: \n  Price freezing on food, medicine and other goods[26] until January 31, 1969\n rent level freeze\n legalization of the permanence of squatting families in boroughs surrounding the historic site of Panama Viejo[25] \n  Parallel to this[clarification needed], the military began a policy of repression against the opposition, who were labeled communists. The military appointed a Provisional Government Junta that was to arrange new elections. However, the National Guard would prove to be very reluctant to abandon power and soon began calling itself El Gobierno Revolucionario (“The Revolutionary Government”). \n  Post-1970[edit]\n      \n Omar Torrijos (right) with farmers in the Panamanian countryside. The Torrijos government was well known for its policies of land redistribution.\n \n \n \n     \n   This section relies largely or entirely on a single source.

(May 2016) \n     Under Omar Torrijos’s control, the military transformed the political and economic structure of the country, initiating massive coverage of social security services and expanding public education. \n The constitution was changed in 1972. For the reform to the constitution[clarification needed] the military created a new organization, the Assembly of Corregimiento Representatives, which replaced the National Assembly. The new assembly, also known as the Poder Popular (“Power of the People”), was composed of 505 members selected by the military with no participation from political parties, which the military had eliminated. The new constitution proclaimed Omar Torrijos the “Maximum Leader of the Panamanian Revolution”, and conceded him unlimited power for six years, although, to keep a façade of constitutionality,[citation needed]Demetrio B. Lakas was appointed president for the same period (Pizzurno Gelós and Araúz, Estudios sobre el Panamá republicano 541).[25]\n In 1981 Torrijos died in a plane crash.[27] Torrijos’ death altered the tone of Panama’s political evolution. Despite the 1983 constitutional amendments which proscribed a political role for the military, the Panama Defense Force (PDF), as they were then known, continued to dominate Panamanian political life. By this time, General Manuel Antonio Noriega was firmly in control of both the PDF and the civilian government.[when?]\n     \n US President Jimmy Carter shakes hands with General Omar Torrijos after signing the Panama Canal Treaties (September 7, 1977).\n \n \n \n In the 1984 elections, the candidates were \n   Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino, supported by the military in a union called UNADE\n Arnulfo Arias Madrid, for the opposition union ADO\n ex-General Rubén Darío Paredes, who had been forced to an early retirement by Noriega, running for Partido Nacionalista Popular PNP (“Popular Nationalist Party”)\n Carlos Iván Zúñiga, running for Partido Acción Popular (PAPO) meaning “Popular Action Party”\n  Barletta was declared the winner of elections that had been clearly won by Madrid. Ardito Barletta inherited a country in economic ruin and hugely indebted to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Amid the economic crisis and Barletta’s efforts to calm the country’s creditors, street protests arose, and so did military repression. \n Meanwhile, Noriega’s regime had fostered a well-hidden criminal economy that operated as a parallel source of income for the military and their allies, providing revenues from drugs and money laundering. Toward the end of the military dictatorship, a new wave of Chinese migrants arrived on the isthmus in the hope of migrating to the United States. The smuggling of Chinese became an enormous business, with revenues of up to 200 million dollars for Noriega’s regime (see Mon 167).[28]\n The military dictatorship, at that time[when?] supported by the United States[citation needed], perpetrated the assassination and torture of more than one hundred Panamanians and forced at least a hundred more dissidents into exile. (see Zárate 15).[29] Noriega also began playing a double role in Central America under the supervision of the CIA.[citation needed] While the Contadora group conducted diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region, Noriega supplied Nicaraguan Contras and other guerrillas in the region with weapons and ammunition.[25]\n On June 6, 1987, the recently retired Colonel Roberto Díaz Herrera, resentful that Noriega had broken the agreed-upon “Torrijos Plan” of succession that would have made him the chief of the military after Noriega, decided to denounce the regime. He revealed details of electoral fraud[clarification needed], accused Noriega of planning Torrijos’s death and declared that Torrijos had received 12 million dollars from the Shah of Iran for giving the exiled Iranian leader asylum. He also accused Noriega of the assassination by decapitation of then-opposition leader, Dr. Hugo Spadafora.[25][citation needed]\n On the night of June 9, 1987, the Cruzada Civilista (“Civic Crusade”) was created[where?] and began organizing actions of civil disobedience. The Crusade called for a general strike. In response, the military suspended constitutional rights and declared a state of emergency in the country. On July 10, the Civic Crusade called for a massive demonstration that was violently repressed by the “Dobermans”, the military’s special riot control unit. That day, later known as El Viernes Negro (“Black Friday”), left six hundred people injured and another six hundred detained, many of whom were later tortured and raped.[citation needed]\n United States President Ronald Reagan began a series of sanctions against the military regime. The United States froze economic and military assistance to Panama in the middle of 1987 in response to the domestic political crisis in Panama and an attack on the US embassy. These sanctions did little to overthrow Noriega, but severely damaged Panama’s economy. The sanctions hit the Panamanian population hard and caused the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to decline almost 25 percent between 1987 and 1989 (see Acosta n.p.).[30]\n On February 5, 1988, General Manuel Antonio Noriega was accused of drug trafficking by federal juries in Tampa and Miami. \n In April 1988, US President Ronald Reagan invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, freezing Panamanian government assets in all US organizations. In May 1989 Panamanians voted overwhelmingly for the anti-Noriega candidates. The Noriega regime promptly annulled the election and embarked on a new round of repression. \n     \n The aftermath of urban warfare during the US invasion of Panama, 1989\n \n \n \n  US invasion (1989)[edit]\n  Further information: United States invasion of Panama \n The United States government said Operation Just Cause, which began on December 20, 1989, was “necessary to safeguard the lives of U.S. citizens in Panama, defend democracy and human rights, combat drug trafficking, and secure the neutrality of the Panama Canal as required by the Torrijos–Carter Treaties” (New York Times, A Transcript of President Bush’s Address n.p.).[31]Human Rights Watch wrote in its 1989 report: “Washington turned a blind eye to abuses in Panama for many years until concern over drug trafficking prompted indictments of the general [Noriega] by two grand juries in Florida in February 1988”.[32] The US reported 23 servicemen killed and 324 wounded, with Panamanian casualties estimated around 450. Described as a surgical maneuver, the action led to estimates of civilian death from 200 to 4,000 during the two weeks of armed activities. The United Nations put the Panamanian civilian death toll at 500, the United States gave a figure of 202 civilians killed and former US attorney general Ramsey Clark estimated 4,000 deaths.[33][34] It represented the largest United States military operation since the end of the Vietnam War (Cajar Páez 22)[35] The number of US civilians (and their dependents), who had worked for the Panama Canal Commission and the US military, and were killed by the Panamanian Defense Forces, has never been fully disclosed. \n On December 29, the United Nations General Assembly approved a resolution calling the intervention in Panama a “flagrant violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States”.[36] A similar resolution was vetoed in the Security Council by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.[37]\n The urban population, many living below the poverty level, was greatly affected by the 1989 intervention. As pointed out in 1995 by a UN Technical Assistance Mission to Panama, the bombardments during the invasion displaced 20,000 people. The most heavily affected district was impoverished El Chorrillo, where several blocks of apartments were completely destroyed. El Chorrillo had been built in days of Canal construction, a series of wooden barracks which easily caught fire under the United States attack.[38][39][40] The economic damage caused by the intervention has been estimated between 1.5 and 2 billion dollars. n.p.[30] Most Panamanians supported the intervention.[32][41]\n  Post-intervention era[edit]\n  Panama’s Electoral Tribunal moved quickly to restore civilian constitutional government, reinstated the results of the May 1989 election on December 27, 1989, and confirmed the victory of President Guillermo Endara and Vice Presidents Guillermo Ford and Ricardo Arias Calderón. \n During its five-year term, the often-fractious government struggled to meet the public’s high expectations. Its new police force was a major improvement over its predecessor but was not fully able to deter crime. Ernesto Pérez Balladares was sworn in as President on September 1, 1994, after an internationally monitored election campaign. \n Perez Balladares ran as the candidate for a three-party coalition dominated by the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), the erstwhile political arm of military dictatorships. Perez Balladares worked skillfully during the campaign to rehabilitate the PRD’s image, emphasizing the party’s populist Torrijos roots rather than its association with Noriega. He won the election with only 33 percent of the vote when the major non-PRD forces splintered into competing factions. His administration carried out economic reforms and often worked closely with the US on implementation of the Canal treaties.[citation needed]\n On September 1, 1999, Mireya Moscoso, the widow of former President Arnulfo Arias Madrid, took office after defeating PRD candidate Martín Torrijos, son of Omar Torrijos, in a free and fair election.[42][citation needed] During her administration, Moscoso attempted to strengthen social programs, especially for child and youth development, protection, and general welfare. Moscoso’s administration successfully handled the Panama Canal transfer and was effective in the administration of the Canal.[42][citation needed]\n     \n British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson swapped football shirts with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in London, 14 May 2018\n \n \n \n The PRD’s Martin Torrijos won the presidency and a legislative majority in the National Assembly in 2004. Torrijos ran his campaign on a platform of, among other pledges, a “zero tolerance” for corruption, a problem endemic to the Moscoso and Perez Balladares administrations.[citation needed] After taking office, Torrijos passed a number of laws which made the government more transparent. He formed a National Anti-Corruption Council whose members represented the highest levels of government and civil society, labor organizations, and religious leadership. In addition, many of his closest Cabinet ministers were non-political technocrats known for their support for the Torrijos government’s anti-corruption aims. Despite the Torrijos administration’s public stance on corruption, many high-profile cases,[clarification needed] particularly involving political or business elites, were never acted upon. \n Conservative supermarket magnate Ricardo Martinelli was elected to succeed Martin Torrijos with a landslide victory in the May 2009 presidential election. Martinelli’s business credentials drew voters worried by slowing growth due to the world financial crisis.[43] Standing for the four-party opposition Alliance for Change, Martinelli gained 60 percent of the vote, against 37 percent for the candidate of the governing left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party. \n On May 4, 2014, Juan Carlos Varela won the 2014 presidential election with over 39 percent of the votes, against the party of his former political partner Ricardo Martinelli, Cambio Democrático, and their candidate José Domingo Arias. He was sworn in on July 1, 2014. \n  Geography[edit]\n      \n A map of Panama\n \n \n \n Main article: Geography of Panama \n     \n La Palma, Darién.\n \n \n \n Panama is located in Central America, bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, between Colombia and Costa Rica. It mostly lies between latitudes 7° and 10°N, and longitudes 77° and 83°W (a small area lies west of 83°). \n Its location on the Isthmus of Panama is strategic. By 2000, Panama controlled the Panama Canal which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea to the North of the Pacific Ocean. Panama’s total area is 74,177.3 km2.[44]\n The dominant feature of Panama’s geography is the central spine of mountains and hills that forms the continental divide. The divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of North America, and only near the Colombian border are there highlands related to the Andean system of South America. The spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom, in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions. \n The mountain range of the divide is called the Cordillera de Talamanca near the Costa Rican border. Farther east it becomes the Serranía de Tabasará, and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus, where the Panama Canal is located, is often called the Sierra de Veraguas. As a whole, the range between Costa Rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographers as the Cordillera Central. \n The highest point in the country is the Volcán Barú, which rises to 3,475 metres (11,401 feet). A nearly impenetrable jungle forms the Darién Gap between Panama and Colombia where Colombian guerrillas and drug dealers operate and sometimes take hostages. This and unrest, and forest protection movements, create a break in the Pan-American Highway, which otherwise forms a complete road from Alaska to Patagonia. \n Panama’s wildlife is the most diverse in Central America. It is home to many South American species as well as to North American wildlife. \n     \n The Chagres River \n \n \n \n  Waterways[edit]\n  Main article: Panama Canal \n Nearly 500 rivers lace Panama’s rugged landscape. Mostly unnavigable, many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the Río Chagres (Chagres River), located in central Panama, is one of the few wide rivers and a source of enormous hydroelectric power. The central part of the river is dammed by the Gatun Dam and forms Gatun Lake, an artificial lake that constitutes part of the Panama Canal. The lake was created by the construction of the Gatun Dam across the Río Chagres between 1907 and 1913. Once created, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world, and the dam was the largest earth dam. The river drains northwest into the Caribbean. The Kampia and Madden Lakes (also filled from the Río Chagres) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former Canal Zone. \n The Río Chepo, another source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific. These Pacific-oriented rivers are longer and slower-running than those on the Caribbean side. Their basins are also more extensive. One of the longest is the Río Tuira, which flows into the Golfo de San Miguel and is the nation’s only river that is navigable by larger vessels. \n  Harbors[edit]\n  The Caribbean coastline is marked by several good natural harbors. However, Cristóbal, at the Caribbean terminus of the canal, had the only important port facilities in the late 1980s. The numerous islands of the Archipiélago de Bocas del Toro, near the Beaches of Costa Rica, provide an extensive natural roadstead and shield the banana port of Almirante. The more than 350 San Blas Islands near Colombia, are strung out over more than 160 kilometres (99 miles) along the sheltered Caribbean coastline. \n     \n Colón Harbor, 2000\n \n \n \n The terminal ports located at each end of the Panama Canal, namely the Port of Cristóbal and the Port of Balboa, are ranked second and third respectively in Latin America in terms of numbers of containers units (TEU) handled.[45] The Port of Balboa covers 182 hectares and contains four berths for containers and two multi-purpose berths. In total, the berths are over 2,400 metres (7,900 feet) long with alongside depth of 15 metres (49 feet). The Port of Balboa has 18 super post-Panamax and Panamax quay cranes and 44 gantry cranes. The Port of Balboa also contains 2,100 square metres (23,000 square feet) of warehouse space.[46]\n The Ports of Cristobal (encompassing the container terminals of Panama Ports Cristobal, Manzanillo International Terminal and Colon Container Terminal) handled 2,210,720 TEU in 2009, second only to the Port of Santos, Brazil, in Latin America. \n Excellent deep water ports capable of accommodating large VLCC (Very Large Crude Oil Carriers) are located at Charco Azul, Chiriquí (Pacific) and Chiriquí Grande, Bocas del Toro (Atlantic) near Panama’s western border with Costa Rica. The Trans-Panama pipeline, running 131 kilometres (81 miles) across the isthmus, has operated between Charco Azul and Chiriquí Grande since 1979.[47]\n  Climate[edit]\n  Main article: Climate of Panama \n     \n Panama map of Köppen climate classification.\n \n \n \n     \n A cooler climate is common in the Panamanian highlands.\n \n \n \n Panama has a tropical climate. Temperatures are uniformly high—as is the relative humidity—and there is little seasonal variation. Diurnal ranges are low; on a typical dry-season day in the capital city, the early morning minimum may be 24 °C (75.2 °F) and the afternoon maximum 30 °C (86.0 °F). The temperature seldom exceeds 32 °C (89.6 °F) for more than a short time. Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean, and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country. Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges, and frosts occur in the Cordillera de Talamanca in western Panama. \n Climatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on rainfall, which varies regionally from less than 1,300 millimeters (51.2 in) to more than 3,000 millimeters (118.1 in) per year. Almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season, which is usually from April to December, but varies in length from seven to nine months. In general, rainfall is much heavier on the Caribbean than on the Pacific side of the continental divide. The annual average in Panama City is little more than half of that in Colón. Although rainy-season thunderstorms are common, the country is outside the hurricane belt. \n Panama’s tropical environment supports an abundance of plants. Forests dominate, interrupted in places by grasslands, scrub, and crops. Although nearly 40% of Panama is still wooded, deforestation is a continuing threat to the rain-drenched woodlands. Tree cover has been reduced by more than 50 percent since the 1940s. Subsistence farming, widely practised from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands, consists largely of corn, bean, and tuber plots. Mangrove swamps occur along parts of both coasts, with banana plantations occupying deltas near Costa Rica. In many places, a multi-canopied rain forest abuts the swamp on one side of the country and extends to the lower reaches of slopes on the other. \n  Politics[edit]\n  Main article: Politics of Panama \n     \n The National Assembly of Panama.\n \n \n \n Panama’s politics take place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Panama is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. \n National elections are universal and mandatory for all citizens 18 years and older. National elections for the executive and legislative branches take place every five years. Members of the judicial branch (justices) are appointed by the head of state. Panama’s National Assembly is elected by proportional representation in fixed electoral districts, so many smaller parties are represented. Presidential elections requires a simple majority; out of the five last presidents only ex-president Ricardo Martinelli has managed to be elected with over 50 percent of the popular vote.[48]\n  Political culture[edit]\n  Since the end of Manuel Noriega’s military dictatorship in 1989, Panama has successfully completed five peaceful transfers of power to opposing political factions. The political landscape is dominated by two major parties and many smaller parties, many of which are driven by individual leaders more than ideologies. Former President Martín Torrijos is the son of general Omar Torrijos. He succeeded Mireya Moscoso, the widow of Arnulfo Arias. Panama’s most recent national elections occurred on May 4, 2014, with incumbent vice-President Juan Carlos Varela declared the victor. \n  Foreign relations[edit]\n  Further information: Foreign relations of Panama \n     \n Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela and Vice President Isabel Saint Malo with former US Secretary of State John Kerry \n \n \n \n The United States cooperates with the Panamanian government in promoting economic, political, security, and social development through US and international agencies. Cultural ties between the two countries are strong, and many Panamanians go to the United States for higher education and advanced training. \n  Military[edit]\n  Further information: Panamanian Public Forces \n The Panamanian Public Forces are the national security forces of Panama. Panama is the second country in Latin America (the other being Costa Rica) to permanently abolish its standing army. Panama maintains armed police and security forces, and small air and maritime forces. They are tasked with law enforcement and can perform limited military actions. \n  Administrative divisions[edit]\n    Bocas del Toro\n Coclé\n Colón\n Chiriquí\n Darién\n Herrera\n Los Santos\n Panamá\n West Panamá\n Veraguas\n Guna Yala\n Comarca Emberá-Wounaan\n Comarca Emberá-Wounaan\n Ngäbe-Buglé Comarca\n Kuna de Madugandí\n Kuna de Wargandí\n \n Main article: Provinces and regions of Panama \n Panama is divided into ten provinces with their respective local authorities (governors).

Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (May 2016) \n         \n A Panamax ship in transit through the Miraflores locks, Panama Canal \n \n \n \n According to the CIA World Factbook, as of 2012[update] Panama had an unemployment rate of 2.7 percent.[9] A food surplus was registered in August 2008. On the Human Development Index, Panama ranked 60th in 2015. In recent years, Panama’s economy has experienced a boom, with growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) averaging over 10.4 percent in 2006–2008. Panama’s economy has been among the fastest growing and best managed in Latin America.[citation needed] The Latin Business Chronicle predicted that Panama would be the fastest growing economy in Latin America during the five-year period from 2010–14, matching Brazil’s 10 percent rate.[49]\n The expansion project on the Panama Canal and the free trade agreement with the United States are expected[who?] to boost and extend economic expansion for some time.[50]\n Despite Panama’s upper-middle per capita GDP, it remains a country of stark contrasts perpetuated by dramatic educational disparities. Over 25 percent of Panama’s population lived in poverty in 2013 and 3 percent of the population lives in extreme poverty, according to reports by the World Bank.[51][52]\n     \n The Marine bridge viaduct\n \n \n \n  Economic sectors[edit]\n  Panama’s economy, because of its key geographic location, is mainly based on a well-developed service sector, especially commerce, tourism, and trading. The handover of the Canal and military installations by the United States has given rise to large construction projects. \n A project to build a third set of locks for the Panama Canal A was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum (with low voter turnout, however) on October 22, 2006. The official estimated cost of the project is US$5.25 billion, but the canal is of major economic importance because it provides millions of dollars of toll revenue to the national economy and provides massive employment. Transfer of control of the Canal to the Panamanian government completed in 1999, after 85 years of US control. \n Copper and gold deposits are being developed by foreign investors, to the dismay of some environmental groups, as all of the projects are located within protected areas.[53]\n  Panama as an IFC[edit]\n  Main articles: Financial centre and Panama as a tax haven \n     \n Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates implicated in the Panama Papers leak on April 15, 2016\n \n \n \n Since the early 20th century, Panama has with the revenues from the canal built the largest Regional Financial Center (IFC)[54] in Central America, with consolidated assets more than three times Panama’s GDP. The banking sector employs more than 24,000 people directly. Financial intermediation contributed 9.3 percent of GDP.[55] Stability has been a key strength of Panama’s financial sector, which has benefited from the country’s favorable economic and business climate. Banking institutions report sound growth and solid financial earnings. The banking supervisory regime is largely compliant with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.[56] As a regional financial center, Panama exports some banking services, mainly to Latin America, and plays an important role in the country’s economy. However, Panama still cannot compare to the position held by Hong Kong or Singapore as financial centers in Asia. \n Panama still has a reputation worldwide for being a tax haven but has agreed to enhanced transparency, especially since the release in 2016 of the Panama Papers. Significant progress has been made to improve full compliance with anti-money laundering recommendations. Panama was removed from the FATFGAFI gray list in February 2016. However efforts remain to be made, and the IMF repeatedly mentions the need to strengthen financial transparency and fiscal structure.[55]\n  Transportation[edit]\n      \n Tocumen International Airport, Central America’s largest airport\n \n \n \n Main article: Transport in Panama \n Panama is home to Tocumen International Airport, Central America’s largest airport. Additionally there are more than 20 smaller airfields in the country. (See list of airports in Panama). \n Panama’s roads, traffic and transportation systems are generally safe, though night driving is difficult and in many cases, restricted by local authorities. This usually occurs in informal settlements.[57] Traffic in Panama moves on the right, and Panamanian law requires that drivers and passengers wear seat belts.[57] Highways are generally well-developed for a Latin American country. \n Currently, Panama City has modern buses known as Metrobuses,[58] along with a Metro line.[59] Formerly, the system was dominated by colorfully painted diablos rojos; a few remain. A diablo rojo is usually customized or painted with bright colors, usually depicting famous actors, politicians or singers. Panama City’s streets experience frequent traffic jams due to poor planning for now-extensive private vehicle ownership. \n  Tourism[edit]\n      \n   This section needs additional citations for verification.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) \n         \n Zapatilla Island, Panama\n \n \n \n Tourism in Panama is rapidly growing.[citation needed] It has maintained its growth over the past five years due to government tax and price discounts to foreign guests and retirees. These economic incentives have caused Panama to be regarded as a relatively good place to retire.[citation needed] Real estate developers in Panama have increased the number of tourism destinations in the past five years because of interest in these visitor incentives.[60]\n The number of tourists from Europe grew by 23.1 percent during the first nine months of 2008. According to the Tourism Authority of Panama (ATP), from January to September, 71,154 tourists from Europe entered Panama, 13,373 more than in same period the previous year. Most of the European tourists were Spaniards (14,820), followed by Italians (13,216), French (10,174) and British (8,833). There were 6997 from Germany, the most populous country in the European Union. Europe has become one of the key markets to promote Panama as a tourist destination. \n In 2012, 4.345.5 million[clarification needed] entered into the Panamanian economy as a result of tourism. This accounted for 9.5 percent of the gross domestic product of the country, surpassing other productive sectors.[citation needed] The number of tourists who arrived that year was 2.2 million.[61]\n     \n Fortifications on the Caribbean Side of Panama: Portobelo-San Lorenzo were declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980.\n \n \n \n Panama enacted Law No. 80 in 2012 to promote foreign investment in tourism. Law 80 replaced an older Law 8 of 1994. Law 80 provides 100 percent exemption from income tax and real estate taxes for 15 years, duty-free imports for construction materials and equipment for five years, and a capital gains tax exemption for five years.[62]\n  Currency[edit]\n  The Panamanian currency is officially the balboa, fixed at a rate of 1:1 with the United States dollar since Panamanian independence in 1903. In practice, Panama is dollarized: US dollars are legal tender and used for all paper currency, while Panama has its own coinage. Because of the tie to US dollars, Panama has traditionally had low inflation. According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Panama’s inflation in 2006 was 2.0 percent as measured by a weighted Consumer Price Index.[63]\n The balboa replaced the Colombian peso in 1904 after Panama’s independence. Balboa banknotes were printed in 1941 by President Arnulfo Arias. They were recalled several days later, giving them the name “The Seven Day Dollar”. The notes were burned by the new government, but occasionally balboa notes can be found in collections. These were the only banknotes ever issued by Panama and US notes have circulated both before and since.[citation needed]\n  International trade[edit]\n  The high levels of Panamanian trade are in large part from the Colón Free Trade Zone, the largest free trade zone in the Western Hemisphere. Last year the zone accounted for 92 percent of Panama’s exports and 64 percent of its imports, according to an analysis of figures from the Colon zone management and estimates of Panama’s trade by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Panama’s economy is also very much supported by the trade and export of coffee and other agricultural products.[citation needed]\n The Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) between the governments of the United States and Panama was signed on October 27, 1982. The treaty protects US investment and assists Panama in its efforts to develop its economy by creating conditions more favorable for US private investment and thereby strengthening the development of its private sector. The BIT was the first such treaty signed by the US in the Western Hemisphere.[64] A Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) was signed in 2007, approved by Panama on July 11, 2007 and by US President Obama on October 21, 2011, and the agreement entered into force on October 31, 2012.[65]\n  Society[edit]\n   Demographics[edit]\n  Main article: Demographics of Panama \n     \n Population pyramid 2016\n \n \n \n     \n Panama’s population, (1961–2003).\n \n \n \n Panama had an estimated population of 4,034,119 in 2016.[3] The proportion of the population aged less than 15 in 2010 was 29 percent. 64.5 percent of the population was between 15 and 65, with 6.6 percent of the population 65 years or older.[66]\n More than half the population lives in the Panama City–Colón metropolitan corridor, which spans several cities. Panama’s urban population exceeds 75 percent, making Panama’s population the most urbanized in Central America.[67]\n  Ethnic groups[edit]\n      \n Panama City, Panama’s capital.\n \n \n \n In 2010 the population was 65 percent Mestizo (mixed white, Native American), 12.3 percent Native American, 9.2 percent Black or African descent, 6.8 percent mulatto, and 6.7 percent White.[9][68]\n Ethnic groups in Panama include Mestizo people, who have a mix of European and native ancestry. Black Afro-Panamanians account for 15–20 percent of the population. Most Afro-Panamanians live on the Panama-Colón metropolitan area, the Darien Province, La Palma, and Bocas Del Toro. Neighborhoods in Panama City that have large black populations include: Curundu, El Chorrillo, Rio Abajo, San Joaquín, El Marañón, San Miguelito, and Santa Ana.[citation needed] Black Panamanians are descendants of African slaves brought to the Americas in the Atlantic Slave Trade. The second wave of black people brought to Panama came from the Caribbean during the construction of the Panama Canal. Panama also has a considerable Chinese and Indian (India) population brought to work on the canal during its construction. Most Chinese-Panamanians reside in the province of Chiriquí.[citation needed] Europeans and white-Panamanians are a minority in Panama. Panama is also home to a small Arab community that has mosques, practises Islam, as well as a Jewish community and many synagogues. \n The Amerindian population includes seven ethnic groups: the Ngäbe, Kuna (Guna), Emberá, Buglé, Wounaan, Naso Tjerdi (Teribe), and Bri Bri.[69]\n  Languages[edit]\n  Further information: Panamanian Spanish \n Spanish is the official and dominant language. The Spanish spoken in Panama is known as Panamanian Spanish. About 93 percent of the population speak Spanish as their first language. Many citizens who hold jobs at international levels, or at business corporations, speak both English and Spanish. Native languages, such as Ngäbere, are spoken throughout the country, mostly in their native territories. Over 400,000 Panamanians keep their native languages and customs.[70] Some new statistics show that as second language, English is spoken by 10 percent, French by 4 percent and Arabic by 1 percent.[71]\n  Largest cities[edit]\n  Further information: List of cities in Panama \n These are the 10 largest Panamanian cities and towns. Most of Panama’s largest cities are part of the Panama City Metropolitan Area. \n \n      \n   v\n t\n e\n  \n  Largest cities or towns in Panama City Population\n \n     Rank   Name   Province  Pop.       \nPanama City\n\nSan Miguelito  1 Panama City Panamá 430,299   \nLas Cumbres\n\nLa Chorrera    2 San Miguelito Panamá 315,019    3 Las Cumbres Panamá 127,440    4 La Chorrera Panamá Oeste 118,521    5 Tocumen Panamá 113,174    6 Pacora Panamá 103,960    7 Arraiján Panamá Oeste 96,676    8 David Chiriquí 81,957    9 Viste Alegre Panamá Oeste 55,114    10 Santiago de Veraguas Veraguas 51,236      Religion[edit]\n  Main article: Religion in Panama \n     \n Plaza de la independencia, Panama City \n \n \n \n The government of Panama does not collect statistics on the religious affiliation of citizens, but various sources estimate that 75–85 percent of the population identifies itself as Roman Catholic and 15–25 percent as Protestant.[72][73] The Bahá’í Faith community of Panama is estimated at 2.00 percent of the national population, or about 60,000[74] including about 10 percent of the Guaymí population.[75]\n The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) claims more than 40,000 members.[76] Smaller religious groups include Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Episcopalians with between 7,000 and 10,000 members, Jewish and Muslim communities with approximately 10,000 members each, Hindus, Buddhists, and other Christians.[73] Indigenous religions include Ibeorgun (among Kuna) and Mamatata (among Ngäbe).[73] There are also a small number of Rastafarians.[73]\n  Education[edit]\n  Main article: Education in Panama \n During the 16th century, education in Panama was provided by Jesuits. Public education began as a national and governmental institution in 1903. The principle underlying the early education system was that children should receive different types of education in accordance with their social class and therefore the position they were expected to occupy in society. \n Public education began in Panama soon after it seceded from Colombia in 1903. The first efforts were guided by an extremely paternalistic view of the goals of education, as evidenced in comments made in a 1913 meeting of the First Panamanian Educational Assembly, “The cultural heritage given to the child should be determined by the social position he will or should occupy. For this reason education should be different in accordance with the social class to which the student should be related.” This elitist focus changed rapidly under US influence.[77]\n In 2010, it was estimated that 94.1 percent of the population was literate (94.7 percent of males and 93.5 percent of females).[72] Education in Panama is compulsory for the children between 6 and 18. In recent decades, school enrollment at all levels, but especially at upper levels, has increased significantly. Panama used to participate in the PISA exams but due to debts and unsatisfactory exam results is postponing participation until 2018.[78]\n  Culture[edit]\n  Main article: Culture of Panama \n See also: Music of Panama \n     \n Pollera \n \n \n \n     \n A couple dancing Panamanian Cumbia\n \n \n \n The culture of Panama derives from European music, art and traditions brought by the Spanish to Panama. Hegemonic forces have created hybrid forms blending African and Native American culture with European culture. For example, the tamborito is a Spanish dance with African rhythms, themes and dance moves.[79]\n Dance is typical of the diverse cultures in Panama. The local folklore can be experienced at a multitude of festivals, through dances and traditions handed down from generation to generation. Local cities host live reggae en español, reggaeton, haitiano (compas), jazz, blues, salsa, reggae, and rock music performances.[citation needed]\n  Handicraft[edit]\n  Outside Panama City, regional festivals take place throughout the year featuring local musicians and dancers. Panama’s blended culture is reflected in traditional products, such as woodcarvings, ceremonial masks and pottery, as well as in Panama’s architecture, cuisine and festivals. In earlier times, baskets were woven for utilitarian uses, but now many villages rely almost exclusively on income from the baskets they produce for tourists. \n An example of undisturbed, unique culture in Panama is that of the Guna who are known for molas. Mola is the Guna word for blouse, but the term mola has come to mean the elaborate embroidered panels made by Guna women, that make up the front and back of a Guna woman’s blouse. They are several layers of cloth, varying in color, that are loosely stitched together, made using a reverse appliqué process. \n  Holidays and festivities[edit]\n  Further information: Public holidays in Panama \n The Christmas parade, known as El desfile de Navidad, is celebrated in the capital, Panama City. This holiday is celebrated on December 25. The floats in the parade are decorated in the Panamanian colors, and women wear dresses called pollera and men dress in traditional montuno. In addition, the marching band in the parade, consisting of drummers, keeps crowds entertained. In the city, a big Christmas tree is lit with Christmas lights, and everybody surrounds the tree and sings Christmas carols.[80]\n  Traditional cuisine[edit]\n  Further information: Panamanian cuisine \n Since Panama’s cultural heritage is influenced by many ethnicities the traditional cuisine of the country includes ingredients from many cultures, from all over the world:[81]\n a mix of African, Spanish, and Native American techniques, dishes, and ingredients, reflecting its diverse population. Since Panama is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking.\n The famous fish market known as the “Mercado de Mariscos” offers fresh seafood and Ceviche, a seafood dish. Small shops along the street which are called kiosco and Empanada, which is a typical latinamerican pastry, including a variety of different ingredients, either with meat or vegetarian, mostly fried. Another kind of pastry is the pastelito, with the only difference in comparison to empanadas is that they are bigger.[citation needed]\n Typical Panamanian foods are mild-flavored, without the pungency of some of Panama’s Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Common ingredients are maize, rice, wheat flour, plantains, yuca (cassava), beef, chicken, pork and seafood. \n  Traditional clothing[edit]\n  Panamanian men’s traditional clothing, called montuno, consists of white cotton shirts, trousers and woven straw hats. \n The traditional women’s clothing is the pollera. It originated in Spain in the 16th century, and by the early 1800s it was typical in Panama, worn by female servants, especially wet nurses (De Zarate 5). Later, it was adopted by upper-class women. \n A pollera is made of “cambric” or “fine linen” (Baker 177). It is white, and is usually about 13 yards of material. \n The original pollera consists of a ruffled blouse worn off the shoulders and a skirt with gold buttons. The skirt is also ruffled, so that when it is lifted up, it looks like a peacock’s tail or a mantilla fan. The designs on the skirt and blouse are usually flowers or birds. Two large matching pom poms (mota) are on the front and back, four ribbons hang from the front and back from the waist, five gold chains (caberstrillos) hang from the neck to the waist, a gold cross or medallion on a black ribbon is worn as a choker, and a silk purse is worn at the waistline. Earrings (zaricillos) are usually gold or coral. Slippers usually match the color of the pollera. Hair is usually worn in a bun, held by three large gold combs that have pearls (tembleques) worn like a crown. Quality pollera can cost up to $10,000, and may take a year to complete. \n Today, there are different types of polleras; the pollera de gala consists of a short-sleeved ruffle skirt blouse, two full-length skirts and a petticoat. Girls wear tembleques in their hair. Gold coins and jewelry are added to the outfit. The pollera montuna is a daily dress, with a blouse, a skirt with a solid color, a single gold chain, and pendant earrings and a natural flower in the hair. Instead of an off-the-shoulder blouse it is worn with a fitted white jacket that has shoulder pleats and a flared hem.[82]\n Traditional clothing in Panama can be worn in parades, where the females and males do a traditional dance. Females gently sway and twirl their skirts, while men hold their hats in their hands and dance behind the females. \n  Literature[edit]\n  Further information: Panamanian literature \n The first literature relating to Panama can be dated to 1535, with a modern literary movement appearing from the mid-19th century onwards \n  Sports[edit]\n      \n Panamanian baseball catcher Carlos Ruiz during 2007 Spring Training.\n \n \n \n The US influence in Panama can be seen in the country’s sports. Baseball is Panama’s national sport and the country has regional teams and a national team that represents it in international events. At least 140 Panamanian players have played professional baseball in the United States, more than any other Central American country.[83] Notable players include Bruce Chen, Rod Carew, Mariano Rivera, Carlos Lee, Manny Sanguillén, and Carlos Ruiz. \n In boxing, four Panamanians are in the International Boxing Hall of Fame: Roberto Durán, Eusebio Pedroza, Ismael Laguna and Panama Al Brown. In August 2016 Panama had two reigning world boxing champions: Guillermo Jones and Anselmo Moreno. \n Since the end of the 20th century, association football has become more popular in Panama.[citation needed] The top tier of domestic Panamanian football, Liga Panameña de Fútbol, was founded in 1988. The national team appeared at the FIFA World Cup for the first time in 2018, appearing in group G, facing Belgium, England and Tunisia. However, the team lost all three games, failing to advance past the group stage. Notable players for the national team include Luis Ernesto Tapia, Rommel Fernández, the Dely Valdés Brothers: Armando, Julio and Jorge; and more recent players as Jaime Penedo, Felipe Baloy, Luis Tejada, Blas Pérez, Román Torres and Harold Cummings. \n Basketball is also popular in Panama. There are regional teams as well as a squad that competes internationally. Two of Panama’s prominent basketball players are Rolando Blackman, a four-time NBA All-Star, and Kevin Daley, a 10-year captain and showman of the Harlem Globetrotters. Other remarkable players who represented Panama internationally are Mario Butler, and Rolando Frazer. \n Other popular sports include volleyball, taekwondo, golf, and tennis. A long-distance hiking trail called the TransPanama Trail is being built from Colombia to Costa Rica. \n Other non-traditional sports in the country have had great importance such as the triathlon that has captured the attention of many athletes nationwide and the country has hosted international competitions. Flag football has also been growing in popularity in both men and women and with international participation in world of this discipline being among the best teams in the world, the sport was introduced by Americans residing in the Canal Zone for veterans and retirees who even had a festival called the Turkey Ball. Other popular sports are American football, rugby, hockey, softball and other amateur sports including skateboarding, BMX and surfing, because the many beaches of Panama such as Santa Catalina and Venao that have hosted events the likes of ISA World Surfing Games. \n Long jumper Irving Saladino became the first Panamanian Olympic gold medalist in 2008. In 2012 eight different athletes represented Panama in the London 2012 Olympics: Irving Saladino in the long jump, Alonso Edward and Andrea Ferris in track and field, Diego Castillo in swimming, and the youngest on the team, Carolena Carstens who was 16 competing in taekwondo. She was the first representative to compete for Panama in that sport. \n  See also[edit]\n     Panama portal \n  Latin America portal \n  \n  Index of Panama-related articles\n Outline of Panama\n   References[edit]\n      ^ “Panama”.

It is bordered on the northeast by Honduras, on the northwest by Guatemala, and on the south by the Pacific Ocean. El Salvador’s capital and largest city is San Salvador. As of 2016[update], the country had a population of approximately 6.34 million.[3]\n El Salvador was for centuries inhabited by several Mesoamerican nations, especially the Cuzcatlecs, as well as the Lenca and Maya. In the early 16th century, the Spanish Empire conquered the territory, incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New Spain ruled from Mexico City. However the Viceroyalty of Mexico had little or no influence in the daily affairs of the Central American isthmus, which would be colonized in 1524. In 1609 the area became the Captaincy General of Guatemala, from which El Salvador was part of until its independence from Spain, which took place in 1821, as part of the First Mexican Empire, then further seceded, as part of the Federal Republic of Central America, in 1823. When the Republic dissolved in 1841, El Salvador became a sovereign nation, then formed a short-lived union with Honduras and Nicaragua called the Greater Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1895 to 1898.[8][9][10]\n From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, El Salvador endured chronic political and economic instability characterized by coups, revolts, and a succession of authoritarian rulers. Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest culminated in the devastating Salvadoran Civil War (1979–1992), which was fought between the military-led government and a coalition of left-wing guerrilla groups. The conflict ended with the Chapultepec Peace Accords. This negotiated settlement established a multiparty constitutional republic, which remains in place to this day. \n El Salvador’s economy has historically been dominated by agriculture, beginning with the indigo plant (añil in Spanish), the most important crop during the colonial period,[11][12] and followed thereafter by coffee, which by the early 20th century accounted for 90 percent of export earnings.[13][14] El Salvador has since reduced its dependence on coffee and embarked on diversifying the economy by opening up trade and financial links and expanding the manufacturing sector.[15] The colón, the official currency of El Salvador since 1892, was replaced by the U.S. dollar in 2001. \n As of 2010[update], El Salvador ranks 12th among Latin American countries in terms of the Human Development Index and fourth in Central America (behind Panama, Costa Rica, and Belize) due in part to ongoing rapid industrialisation.[16] However, the country continues to struggle with high rates of poverty, inequality, and crime. \n   Contents  \n \n   1 Etymology \n  2 History   2.1 Prehistoric \n  2.2 Pre-Columbian \n  2.3 European contact (1522)   2.3.1 Conquest of Cuzcatlán (1524–1525) \n  \n  2.4 Spanish rule (1525–1821) \n  2.5 Independence (1821) \n  2.6 20th century \n  2.7 Salvadoran Civil War (1979–1992) \n  2.8 Post-war (1992–present) \n  \n  3 Geography   3.1 Climate \n  3.2 Natural disasters   3.2.1 Extreme weather events \n  3.2.2 Earthquakes and volcanic activity \n  \n  3.3 Biodiversity and endangered species \n  \n  4 Government and politics   4.1 Political culture \n  4.2 Foreign relations \n  4.3 Military \n  4.4 Human rights \n  4.5 Administrative divisions \n  \n  5 Economy   5.1 Remittances from abroad \n  5.2 Free trade agreements \n  5.3 Official corruption and foreign investment \n  5.4 Tourism \n  \n  6 Infrastructure   6.1 Water supply and sanitation \n  \n  7 Demographics   7.1 Ethnic groups \n  7.2 Languages \n  7.3 Largest cities \n  7.4 Religion \n  \n  8 Health \n  9 Education \n  10 Crime \n  11 Culture   11.1 Public holidays \n  11.2 Cuisine \n  11.3 Music \n  11.4 Sport \n  \n  12 See also \n  13 References \n  14 Further reading \n  15 External links \n  \n Etymology Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado named the new province for Jesus Christ – El Salvador (“The Savior”).

(September 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) \n     Main article: History of El Salvador \n Prehistoric     \n Excavation of a Megatherium in the Tomayate site Apopa.\n \n \n \n     \n Skull fossil of an ancient-horse in the Tomayate site Apopa.\n \n \n \n Tomayate is a paleontological site located on the banks of the river of the same name in the municipality of Apopa. The site has produced abundant Salvadoran megafauna fossils belonging to the Pleistocene epoch. The paleontological site was discovered accidentally in 2000, and in the following year, an excavation by the Museum of Natural History of El Salvador revealed not only several remnants of Cuvieronius, but also several other species of vertebrates. In the Tomayate site, they have recovered at least 19 species of vertebrates, including giant tortoises, Megatherium, Glyptodon, Toxodon, extinct horses, paleo-llamas and especially a large number of skeletal remains of proboscis genus Cuvieronius. The Tomayate site stands out from most Central American Pleistocene deposits, being more ancient and much richer, which provides valuable information of the Great American Interchange, in which the Central American isthmus landbridge played the title primordial role. At the same time, it is considered the richest vertebrate paleontological site in Central America and one of the largest accumulations of proboscideans in the Americas. \n Pre-Columbian Main article: Cuzcatlan \n     \n Temazcal in Joya de Ceren.\n \n \n \n Sophisticated civilization in El Salvador dates to its settlement by the indigenous Lenca people; theirs was the first and the oldest indigenous civilization to settle in El Salvador. The Lenca were succeeded by the Olmecs, who eventually also disappeared, leaving their monumental architecture in the form of the pyramids still extant in western El Salvador. The Maya arrived and settled in place of the Olmecs, but their numbers were greatly diminished when the Ilopango supervolcano eruption caused a massive Mayan exodus out of what is now El Salvador.[18]\n Centuries later they themselves were replaced by the Pipil people, Nahua speaking groups[18] who migrated from Mexico in the centuries before the European conquest and occupied the central and western regions. The Pipil were the last indigenous people to arrive in El Salvador.[19] They called their territory Kuskatan, a Pipil word[20] meaning The Place of Precious Jewels, backformed into Classical Nahuatl Cōzcatlān, and Hispanicized as Cuzcatlán.[21][22] The people of El Salvador today are referred to as Salvadoran, while the term Cuzcatleco is commonly used to identify someone of Salvadoran heritage. \n In pre-Columbian times, the country was also inhabited by various other indigenous peoples, including the Lenca, a Chilanga Lencan-speaking group[23] who settled in the eastern highlands.[24] Cuzcatlan was the larger domain until the Spanish conquest. Since El Salvador resided on the eastern edge of the Maya Civilization, the origins of many of El Salvador’s ruins are controversial. However, it is widely agreed that Mayas likely occupied the areas around Lago de Guija and Cihuatán. Other ruins such as Tazumal, Joya de Cerén and San Andrés may have been built by the Pipil or the Maya or possibly both.[25]\n  European contact (1522)\n  By 1521, the indigenous population of the Mesoamerican area had been drastically reduced by the smallpox epidemic that was spreading throughout the territory, although it had not yet reached pandemic levels in Cuzcatlán.[26][27][28] The first known visit by Spaniards to what is now Salvadoran territory was made by the Spanish admiral, Andrés Niño, who led a Spanish expedition to Central America. He disembarked in the Gulf of Fonseca on May 31, 1522, at Meanguera island, naming it Petronila,[29] and then discovered Jiquilisco Bay on the mouth of Lempa River. The first indigenous people to have contact with the Spanish were the Lenca of eastern El Salvador. \n  Conquest of Cuzcatlán (1524–1525)\n  Main article: Spanish conquest of El Salvador \n     \n Spanish Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado.\n \n \n \n In 1524, after participating in the conquest of Mexico, Spanish conquistadors led by Pedro de Alvarado and his brother Gonzalo crossed the Rio Paz (Peace River) from the area comprising the present Republic of Guatemala into what is now the Republic of El Salvador. The Spaniards were disappointed to discover that the indigenous Pipil people had no gold or jewels like those they had found in Guatemala or Mexico, but recognized the richness of the land’s volcanic soil. \n Pedro de Alvarado led the first incursion by Spanish forces to extend their dominion to the nation of Cuzcatlan (El Salvador), in June 1524.[30]\n When he arrived at the borders of the Cuzcatlan kingdom he saw that civilians had been evacuated. Cuzcatlec warriors moved to the coastal city of Acajutla and waited for Alvarado and his forces. Alvarado approached, confident that the result would be similar to what occurred in Mexico and Guatemala where the people believed the Spanish were gods. He thought he would easily defeat this new indigenous force since his Mexican allies and the Pipil of Cuzcatlan spoke a similar language. \n The Indigenous peoples of El Salvador did not see the Spanish as gods, but as foreign invaders. Alvarado saw that the Cuzcatan force outnumbered his Spanish soldiers and Mexican Indian allies. The Spanish withdrew and the Cuzcatlec army attacked, running behind them with war chants and shooting bow arrows. Alvarado had no choice but to fight to survive.[citation needed]\n Alvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail as having shields made of colorful exotic feathers, a vest-like armor made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and large spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez.[citation needed]\n The Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to the Spanish king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, “If you want your weapons, come get them”. As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed. \n     \n Tazumal ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.\n \n \n \n The Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbors. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican Tlaxcala Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, Gonzalo de Alvarado, to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of smallpox. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatlán was completed and the city of San Salvador was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas. \n In 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of San Miguel, headed by another explorer and conquistador, Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.[31] The kingdom of Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso’s invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison. \n For ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of Intibucá. \n Antu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to Lempira (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537. \n  Spanish rule (1525–1821)\n      \n A painting of the First Independence Movement celebration in San Salvador. At the center, José Matías Delgado.\n \n \n \n     \n Manuel José Arce joined the movement for independence from Spain, joining in the first Cry for Independence on November 5, 1811 in San Salvador.\n \n \n \n During the colonial period, El Salvador was part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, also known as the Kingdom of Guatemala (Spanish: Reino de Guatemala), created in 1609 as an administrative division of New Spain. The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an intendancia in 1786. \n Towards the end of 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country’s affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the French and American revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown’s military power as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively. \n In November 1811 Salvadoran priest José Matías Delgado rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the 1811 Independence Movement. This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, and again this insurrection was also suppressed. \n  Independence (1821)\n  In 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the Act of Independence of Central America, which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of Chiapas) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the Federal Republic of Central America. \n In early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted First Mexican Empire under Agustín de Iturbide. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to San Salvador and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.) \n When the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the Greater Republic of Central America, which dissolved in 1898. \n After the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that coffee yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an oligarchy of just a few families.[32]\n Throughout the last half of the 19th century, a succession of presidents from the ranks of the Salvadoran oligarchy, nominally both conservative and liberal, generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the predominant cash crop, the development of infrastructure (railroads and port facilities) primarily in support of the coffee trade, the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production, the passage of anti-vagrancy laws to ensure that displaced campesinos and other rural residents provided sufficient labor for the coffee fincas (plantations), and the suppression of rural discontent. In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force. \n 20th century     \n Gen. Tomás Regalado\n \n \n \n In 1898, Gen. Tomas Regalado gained power by force, deposing Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador, and was killed July 11, 1906, at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President Dr. Manuel Enrique Araujo was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder. \n     \n Dios, Union, Libertad (God, Union, Liberty) El Salvador 1912 Flag.\n \n \n \n Araujo’s administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. Pio Romero Bosque, ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President Jorge Meléndez and in 1930 announced free elections, in which Arturo Araujo came to power on March 1, 1931 in what was considered the country’s first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was Gen. Maximiliano Hernández Martínez. \n In December 1931, a coup d’état organized by junior officers and led by Gen. Martínez started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces. \n The Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,[33] a rich anti-Communist banker called Rodolfo Duke, and later installed the ardent fascist Gen. Martínez as president. The revolt was probably due to the army’s discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt. \n The U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Martínez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944, but resigned in May after a general strike. Martínez had said he was going to respect the Constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise. \n From December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Martínez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising, originally led by Farabundo Martí and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as La Matanza (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of peasants died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez. \n In the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader Farabundo Martí helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of Marxist-Leninist ideology (strongly rejecting Stalinism). In December 1930, at the height of the country’s economic and social depression, Martí was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation’s poor and rumors of his upcoming nomination for President the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Martí returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military. \n     \n José Napoleón Duarte.\n \n \n \n They helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by killing over 30,000 people at what was to have been a “peaceful meeting” in 1932; this became known as La Matanza (The Slaughter). The peasant uprising against Martínez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Martínez, who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Martí shot after a perfunctory hearing. \n Historically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighboring Honduras, as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the 1969 Football War between the two countries.[34] As many as 130,000 Salvadorans were forcibly expelled or fled from Honduras.[35]\n The Christian Democratic Party (PDC) and the National Conciliation Party (PCN) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election;[36] Both parties have since reconstituted. They share common ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military. \n PDC leader José Napoleón Duarte was the mayor of San Salvador from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the regime of PCN President Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo, who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly. Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the National Opposition Union (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col. Arturo Armando Molina, in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers’ request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer. \n  Salvadoran Civil War (1979–1992)\n  Further information: Salvadoran Civil War \n In October 1979, a coup d’état brought the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte’s stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed agrarian reform, and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the army such as Gen. Majano and Gen. Gutierrez,[37][38] as well as with progressives such as Guillermo Ungo and Alvarez. \n     \n A billboard serving as a reminder of one of many massacres that occurred during the civil war.\n \n \n \n Pressure from the oligarchy soon dissolved the junta because of its inability to control the army in its repression of the people fighting for unionization rights, agrarian reform, better wages, accessible health care and freedom of expression. In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, death squads were killing about 10 people each day, and the FMLN had 6,000 – 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.[39]\n     \n ERP combatants in Perquín, 1990.\n \n \n \n The U.S. supported and financed the creation of a second junta to change the political environment and stop the spread of a leftist insurrection. Napoleón Duarte was recalled from his exile in Venezuela to head this new junta. However, a revolution was already underway and his new role as head of the junta was seen by the general population as opportunistic. He was unable to influence the outcome of the insurrection. Óscar Romero, Archbishop of San Salvador, denounced injustices and massacres committed against civilians by government forces. He was considered “the voice of the voiceless”, but he was assassinated by a death squad while saying Mass on 24 March 1980.[40] Some consider this to be the beginning of the full Salvadoran Civil War, which lasted from 1980 to 1992. An unknown number of people “disappeared” during the conflict, and the UN reports that more than 75,000 were killed.[41] The Salvadoran Army’s US-trained Atlacatl Battalion was responsible for the El Mozote massacre where more than 800 civilians were murdered, over half of them children, the El Calabozo massacre, and the murder of UCA scholars.[42]\n     \n A reconstruction of Radio Venceremos, at the Museo de la Palabra y la Imagen, San Salvador.\n \n \n \n On January 16, 1992, the government of El Salvador, represented by president Alfredo Cristiani, and the FMLN, represented by the commanders of the five guerrilla groups – Shafik Handal, Joaquín Villalobos, Salvador Sánchez Cerén, Francisco Jovel and Eduardo Sancho, all signed peace agreements brokered by the United Nations ending the 12-year civil war. This event, held at Chapultepec Castle in Mexico, was attended by U.N. dignitaries and other representatives of the international community. After signing the armistice, the president stood up and shook hands with all the now ex-guerrilla commanders, an action which was widely admired. \n  Post-war (1992–present)\n  The so-called Chapultepec Peace Accords mandated reductions in the size of the army, and the dissolution of the National Police, the Treasury Police, the National Guard and the Civilian Defense, a paramilitary group. A new Civil Police was to be organized. Judicial immunity for crimes committed by the armed forces ended; the government agreed to submit to the recommendations of a Commission on the Truth for El Salvador (Comisión de la Verdad Para El Salvador), which would “investigate serious acts of violence occurring since 1980, and the nature and effects of the violence, and…recommend methods of promoting national reconciliation.” In 1993 the Commission delivered its findings reporting human rights violations on both sides of the conflict.[43] Five days later the El Salvadoran legislature passed an amnesty law for all acts of violence during the period. \n From 1989 until 2004, Salvadorans favored the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) party, voting in ARENA presidents in every election (Alfredo Cristiani, Armando Calderón Sol, Francisco Flores Pérez, Antonio Saca) until 2009, when Mauricio Funes was elected president from the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) party. \n Economic reforms since the early 1990s brought major benefits in terms of improved social conditions, diversification of the export sector, and access to international financial markets at investment grade level. Crime remains a major problem for the investment climate. \n This[clarification needed] all ended in 2001, and support for ARENA weakened. Internal turmoil in ARENA weakened the party also, while the FMLN united and broadened its support.[44]\n The unsuccessful attempts of the left-wing party to win presidential elections led to its selection of a journalist rather than a former guerrilla leader as a candidate. On March 15, 2009, Mauricio Funes, a television figure, became the first president from the FMLN party. He was inaugurated on June 1, 2009. One focus of the Funes government has been revealing the alleged corruption from the past government.[45]\n ARENA formally expelled Saca from the party in December 2009. With 12 loyalists in the National Assembly, Saca established his own party, GANA (Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional or Grand Alliance for National Unity), and entered into a tactical legislative alliance with the FMLN.[46] After three years in office, with Saca’s GANA party providing the FMLN with a legislative majority, Funes had not taken action to either investigate or to bring corrupt former officials to justice. \n Early in the new millennium, El Salvador’s government created the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales – the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) and began promoting the integration of climate change into national policy. This move was in response to the increase in extreme weather events affecting the country. Initially MARN aimed to fulfil the country’s obligations following its ratification of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto protocol However, since Hurricane Ida in 2009, the government’s stance has shifted towards integrating risk reduction into all areas of policy, including financial.[47]\n In a specific effort to increase the resilience of its economy and people to climate-related events, El Salvador commissioned a project in 2011 to develop and implement a National Policy and Strategy for Climate Change, which culminated with the launch of the National Environmental Policy in June 2012 and the National Environmental Strategy in June 2013, both incorporating climate change goals. This work was undertaken with support from the Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network. The government is now preparing action plans for putting the strategy into practice.[47]\n Geography Main article: Geography of El Salvador \n      \n Panoramic of Coatepeque Caldera, Cerro Verde and Izalco (volcano) \n \n \n \n \n     \n A map of El Salvador\n \n \n \n El Salvador lies in the isthmus of Central America between latitudes 13° and 15°N, and longitudes 87° and 91°W. It stretches 270 km (168 mi) from west-northwest to east-southeast and 142 km (88 mi) north to south, with a total area of 21,041 km2 (8,124 sq mi). As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called Pulgarcito de America (the “Tom Thumb of the Americas”). The highest point in El Salvador is Cerro El Pital, at 2,730 metres (8,957 ft), on the border with Honduras. \n El Salvador has a long history of destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes, two of them, San Miguel and Izalco, active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name “Lighthouse of the Pacific.” Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone. \n El Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador’s only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country’s area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the Goascorán, Jiboa, Torola, Paz and the Río Grande de San Miguel. \n There are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are Lake Ilopango (70 km2) and Lake Coatepeque (26 km2). Lake Güija is El Salvador’s largest natural lake (44 km2). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is Embalse Cerrón Grande (135 km2). There are a total 320 km2 (123.6 sq mi) of water within El Salvador’s borders. \n El Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is 546 km (339 mi): 126 miles (203 km) with Guatemala and 343 km (213 mi) with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is 307 km (191 mi) long. \n Two parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central plateau, covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands. \n Climate Main article: Climate of El Salvador \n     \n El Salvador’s topography.\n \n \n \n El Salvador has a tropical climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as invierno or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170 mm. \n The best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. Hurricanes occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of Hurricane Mitch, which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America. \n From November through April, the northeast trade winds control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as verano, or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in Honduras. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures will be cool. In the extreme northeastern part of the country near Cerro El Pital, snow is known to fall during summer as well as during winter due to the high elevations (it is the coldest part of the country). \n Natural disasters Extreme weather events     \n Volcanic range, Cordillera de Apaneca, view from Salcoatitán \n \n \n \n El Salvador’s position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe droughts, both of which may be made more extreme by the El Niño and La Niña effects. Severe deforestation and soil erosion have made the landscape vulnerable to landslides and forest fires. These characteristics, coupled with severe fiscal constraints, make the nation highly susceptible to the impacts of extreme weather events.[48]\n In the summer of 2001 a severe drought destroyed 80% of El Salvador’s crops, causing famine in the countryside.[49][50] On October 4, 2005, severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and landslides, which caused a minimum of fifty deaths.[51] In 2010, losses to agriculture from flooding exceeded US$100 million, while those resulting from drought were US$38 million.[52]\n El Salvador’s location in Central America also makes it vulnerable to severe storms and hurricanes coming off the Caribbean. Since the 1990s, there has been an increase in the frequency and duration of storms, as well as a marked change in the pattern of their occurrence. Hurricanes used to strike El Salvador infrequently, only came from the Atlantic and were limited to the months of September and October. However, since the mid 1990s, such storms have occurred more frequently, originated in both the Atlantic and Pacific, and have struck in six different months of the year.[47]\n Earthquakes and volcanic activity     \n San Miguel volcano in 2013\n \n \n \n El Salvador lies along the Pacific Ring of Fire, and is thus subject to significant tectonic activity, including frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity. Recent examples include the earthquake on January 13, 2001 that measured 7.7 on the Richter magnitude scale and caused a landslide that killed more than 800 people;[51] and another earthquake only a month later, on February 13, 2001, that killed 255 people and damaged about 20% of the nation’s housing. Luckily, many families were able to find safety from the landslides caused by the earthquake. \n The San Salvador area has been hit by earthquakes in 1576, 1659, 1798, 1839, 1854, 1873, 1880, 1917, 1919, 1965, 1986, 2001 and 2005.[53] The 5.7 Mw-earthquake of 1986 resulted in 1,500 deaths, 10,000 injuries, and 100,000 people left homeless.[54][55]\n El Salvador’s most recent destructive volcanic eruption took place on October 1, 2005, when the Santa Ana Volcano spewed a cloud of ash, hot mud and rocks that fell on nearby villages and caused two deaths. The most severe volcanic eruption in this area occurred in the 5th century AD when the Ilopango volcano erupted with a VEI strength of 6, producing widespread pyroclastic flows and devastating Mayan cities.[56]\n The Santa Ana Volcano in El Salvador is active;[57] the most recent eruptions were in 1904 and 2005. Lago de Coatepeque (one of El Salvador’s lakes) was created by water filling the caldera that formed after a massive eruption. \n The British Imperial College’s El Salvador Project aims to build earthquake-proof buildings in remote areas of the country. \n Biodiversity and endangered species     \n The torogoz is El Salvador’s national bird.\n \n \n \n There are eight species of sea turtles in the world; six of them nest on the coasts of Central America, and four make their home on the Salvadoran coast: the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), the hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), the green sea turtle (black) (Chelonia agasizzii) and the olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea). Of these four species, the most common is the olive ridley turtle, followed by the green sea turtle. The other two species, hawksbill and leatherback, are much more difficult to find as they are critically endangered, while the olive ridley and green sea turtle are in danger of extinction. \n Recent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country’s biological diversity. In 1997, the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999. Specific legislation to protect wildlife is still pending.[when?] In addition, a number of non-governmental organizations are doing important work to safeguard some of the country’s most important forested areas. Foremost among these is SalvaNatura, which manages El Impossible, the country’s largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador’s environmental authorities. \n Despite these efforts, much remains to be done. \n It is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador. \n Government and politics Main article: Politics of El Salvador \n The 1983 Constitution is the highest legal authority in the country. El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are: \n     \n Salvadoran cadets in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador\n \n \n \n  The Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years. He can be elected to only one term. The president has a Cabinet of Ministers whom he appoints, and is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n The Legislative Branch, called El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly (unicameral), consisting of 84 deputies.\n The Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of 15 judges, one of them being elected as President of the Judiciary.\n  \n  After the Civil War, the Chapultepec Peace Accords (1992) created the new National Civil Police, the Attorney for the Defense of Human Rights and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The Peace Accords re-imagined the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional (FMLN) as a political party and redefined the role of the army to be for the defense of the sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Accords also removed some security forces who were in command of the army, such as the National Guard, Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s. \n The political framework of El Salvador is a presidential representative democratic republic with a multiform, multi-party system. The President, currently Salvador Sánchez Cerén, is both head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Legislative Assembly. The country also has an independent Judiciary and Supreme Court. \n Political culture Further information: List of political parties in El Salvador \n     \n El Salvador’s president Salvador Sánchez Cerén (left) with Russian ambassador to Nicaragua\n \n \n \n El Salvador has a multi-party system. Two political parties, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. ARENA candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of Mauricio Funes of the FMLN in March 2009. The FMLN Party is Leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant Marxist-Leninist faction in the legislature, and the social liberal wing led by President Funes. \n Geographically, the departments of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. The winner of the 2014 presidential election, Salvador Sánchez Cerén belongs to the FMLN party. In the 2015 elections for mayors and members of the National Assembly, ARENA appeared to be the winner with tight control of the National Assembly. \n Foreign relations Further information: Foreign relations of El Salvador \n     \n President Sánchez Cerén at the 2017 CELAC Summit in Dominican Republic\n \n \n \n In November, 1950 El Salvador helped the newly empowered 14th Dalai Lama by supporting his Tibetan Government cabinet minister’s telegram requesting an appeal before the General Assembly of the United Nations to stop the Communist China’s People’s Liberation Army’s invasion of Tibet. “Only the tiny country of El Salvador agreed to sponsor Tibet’s plea.”[58]“At the UN, no one was willing to stand up beside El Salvador. The other nations had overriding self-interests, which made it impossible for them to support San Salvador’s attempt to bring the invasion before the General Assembly.”[58] With no other countries in support, “the UN unanimously dropped the Tibetan plea from its agenda.”[58]\n El Salvador is a member of the United Nations and several of its specialized agencies, the Organization of American States (OAS), the Central American Common Market (CACM), the Central American Parliament (PARLACEN), and the Central American Integration System (SICA). It actively participates in the Central American Security Commission (CASC), which seeks to promote regional arms control. \n El Salvador also is a member of the World Trade Organization and is pursuing regional free trade agreements. An active participant in the Summit of the Americas process, El Salvador chairs a working group on market access under the Free Trade Area of the Americas initiative. \n Military Further information: Armed Forces of El Salvador \n El Salvador has an army, airforce and modest navy. There are around 17,000 personnel in the armed forces in total.[59]\n Human rights Main article: Human rights in El Salvador \n Amnesty International has drawn attention to several arrests of police officers for unlawful police killings. Other current issues to gain Amnesty International’s attention in the past 10 years include missing children, failure of law enforcement to properly investigate and prosecute crimes against women, and rendering organized labor illegal.[60]\n Administrative divisions Further information: Departments of El Salvador \n El Salvador is divided into 14 departments (departamentos), which in turn are subdivided into 262 municipalities (municipios). \n Department names and capitals for the 14 Salvadoran Departments: \n    Departments of El Salvador           Western El Salvador \nAhuachapán (Ahuachapán)\nSanta Ana (Santa Ana)\nSonsonate (Sonsonate)   Central El Salvador \nLa Libertad (Santa Tecla)\nChalatenango (Chalatenango)\nCuscatlán (Cojutepeque)\nSan Salvador (San Salvador)\nLa Paz (Zacatecoluca)\nCabañas (Sensuntepeque)\nSan Vicente (San Vicente)   Eastern El Salvador \nUsulután (Usulután)\nSan Miguel (San Miguel)\nMorazán (San Francisco Gotera)\nLa Unión (La Unión)     Note: Departmental capitals are in parentheses.     Economy Main article: Economy of El Salvador \n     \n A proportional representation of El Salvador’s exports\n \n \n \n El Salvador’s economy has been hampered at times by natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, by government policies that mandate large economic subsidies, and by official corruption. Subsidies became such a problem that in April 2012, the International Monetary Fund suspended a $750 million loan to the central government. President Funes’ chief of cabinet, Alex Segovia, acknowledged that the economy was at the “point of collapse.”[61]\n Antiguo Cuscatlán has the highest per capita income of all the cities in the country, and is a center of international investment.[citation needed]\n GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2008 was estimated at US$25.895 billion. The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 64.1%, followed by the industrial sector at 24.7% (2008 est.). Agriculture represents only 11.2% of GDP (2010 est.) \n The GDP grew after 1996 at an annual rate that averaged 3.2% real growth. The government committed to free market initiatives, and the 2007 GDP’s real growth rate was 4.7%.[62]\n In December 1999, net international reserves equaled US$1.8 billion or roughly five months of imports. Having this hard currency buffer to work with, the Salvadoran government undertook a monetary integration plan beginning January 1, 2001 by which the U.S. dollar became legal tender alongside the Salvadoran colón, and all formal accounting was done in U.S. dollars. Thus, the government has formally limited the implementing of open market monetary policies to influence short-term variables in the economy. As of September 2007, net international reserves stood at $2.42 billion.[51][63]\n It has long been a challenge in El Salvador to develop new growth sectors for a more diversified economy. In the past, the country produced gold and silver,[64] but recent attempts to reopen the mining sector, which were expected to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the local economy, collapsed after President Saca shut down the operations of Pacific Rim Mining Corporation. Nevertheless, according to the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies (Instituto Centroamericano for Estudios Fiscales, by its acronym in Spanish), the contribution of metallic mining was a minuscule 0.3% of the country’s GDP between 2010 and 2015.[65] Saca’s decision although not lacking political motives, had strong support from local residents and grassroots movements in the country. According to NACLA, incoming President Funes later rejected a company’s application for a further permit based on the risk of cyanide contamination on one of the country’s main rivers.[66]\n As with other former colonies, El Salvador was considered a mono-export economy (an economy that depended heavily on one type of export) for many years. During colonial times, El Salvador was a thriving exporter of indigo, but after the invention of synthetic dyes in the 19th century, the newly created modern state turned to coffee as the main export. \n     \n San Miguel is an important economic center of El Salvador and home to the “Carnival of San Miguel”, one of the biggest festivals of entertainment and food in Central America.[67] \n \n \n \n The government has sought to improve the collection of its current revenues, with a focus on indirect taxes. A 10% value-added tax (IVA in Spanish), implemented in September 1992, was raised to 13% in July 1995. \n Inflation has been steady and among the lowest in the region. Since 1997 inflation has averaged 3%, with recent years increasing to nearly 5%. As a result of the free trade agreements, from 2000 to 2006, total exports have grown 19% from $2.94 billion to $3.51 billion, and total imports have risen 54% from $4.95 billion to $7.63 billion. This has resulted in a 102% increase in the trade deficit, from $2.01 billion to $4.12 billion.[68]\n     \n El Chorreron, El Salvador; tourism is the fastest-growing sector of the Salvadoran economy.\n \n \n \n El Salvador has promoted an open trade and investment environment, and has embarked on a wave of privatization extending to telecommunications, electricity distribution, banking, and pension funds. In late 2006, the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $461 million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country’s northern region, the primary conflict zone during the civil war, through investments in education, public services, enterprise development, and transportation infrastructure. With the adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any international financing. \n    Exports to  Imports from    Country  %  Country  %      United States  66%    United States  43.4%    Caribbean  26%    Guatemala  8.2%      Mexico  1%    Mexico  7.8%      Spain  1%  Europe  7.0%    Others  6%  Others  33.6%     Remittances from abroad El Salvador leads the region in remittances per capita, with inflows equivalent to nearly all export income; about a third of all households receive these financial inflows. Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States, sent to family members in El Salvador, are a major source of foreign income and offset the substantial trade deficit of $4.12 billion. Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade, and reached an all-time high of $3.32 billion in 2006 (an increase of 17% over the previous year).[69] approximately 16.2% of gross domestic product(GDP). \n Remittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador. In 2005, the number of people living in extreme poverty in El Salvador was 20%,[70] according to a United Nations Development Program report. Without remittances, the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased. \n Money from remittances has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans, and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.[71]\n Free trade agreements     \n Torre Futura at World Trade Center San Salvador \n \n \n \n In 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector’s competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives. \n There are a total of 15 free trade zones in El Salvador. El Salvador signed the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) — negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the Dominican Republic — with the United States in 2004. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster free trade. El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico, Chile, the Dominican Republic, and Panama and increased its trade with those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada. In October 2007, these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. Negotiations started in 2006 for a free trade agreement with Colombia. \n Official corruption and foreign investment In an analysis of ARENA’s electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government. According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, “While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behavior by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d’Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder Roberto d’Aubuisson, told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca ‘deliberately ignored’ his Public Works Minister’s government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests.”[72]\n Subsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank’s annual “Ease of doing business” index.[73]\n As per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, “Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most “business friendly” country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labor force and a strategic geographical position. The country’s membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI.”[74]\n Foreign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy’s Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in. Four years later, Enel indicated it would seek arbitration against El Salvador, blaming the government for technical problems that prevent it from completing its investment.[75] The government came to its defense claiming that Art 109 of the constitution does not allow any government (regardless of the party they belong), to privatize the resources of the national soil (in this case geothermic energy). The dispute came to an end in December 2014 when both parties came to a settlement, from which no details have been released. The small country had yielded to pressure from the Washington based powerful ICSID.[76] The U.S. Embassy warned in 2009 that the Salvadoran government’s populist policies of mandating artificially low electricity prices were damaging private sector profitability, including the interests of American investors in the energy sector.[77] The U.S. Embassy noted the corruption of El Salvador’s judicial system and quietly urged American businesses to include “arbitration clauses, preferably with a foreign venue,” when doing business in the country.[78]\n The U.S. Embassy warned in 2009 that the Salvadoran government’s populist policies of mandating artificially low electricity prices were damaging private sector profitability, including the interests of American investors in the energy sector.[77] The U.S. Embassy noted the corruption of El Salvador’s judicial system and quietly urged American businesses to include “arbitration clauses, preferably with a foreign venue,” when doing business in the country.[78]\n On the other hand, a 2008 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [2] indicates that one third of the generation of electricity in El Salvador was publicly owned while two thirds was in American hands and other foreign ownership. It is only natural for a small, under-developed country like El Salvador to subsidize some of the resources for the vast majority of its poor population. \n Although some events may have tarnished the image of the El Salvadoran government,[79] not everything is bad news. In terms of how people perceived the levels of public corruption in 2014, El Salvador ranks 80 out of 175 countries as per the Corruption Perception Index.[80] El Salvador’s rating compares relatively well with Panama (94 of 175) and Costa Rica (47 of 175). \n Tourism Further information: Tourism in El Salvador \n     \n Moncagua, San Miguel\n \n \n \n It was estimated that 1,394,000 international tourists would visit El Salvador in 2014.[81] Tourism contributed US$855.5 million to El Salvador’s GDP in 2013. This represented 3.5% of total GDP.[82]\n Tourism directly supported 80,500 jobs in 2013. This represented 3.1% of total employment in El Salvador.[82] In 2013, tourism indirectly supported 210,000 jobs, representing 8.1% of total employment in El Salvador.[82]\n The airport serving international flights in El Salvador is Comalapa International Airport. This airport is located about 40 km (25 mi) southeast of San Salvador.[83]\n     \n El Salvador has surf tourism due to large waves from the Pacific Ocean.\n \n \n \n Most North American and European tourists seek out El Salvador’s beaches and nightlife. Besides these two attractions, El Salvador’s tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries. Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public. Surfing is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular. \n Surfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador, finding surfing spots that are not yet overcrowded. The use of the United States dollar as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists. Urbanization and Americanization of Salvadoran culture has also led to the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador. \n According to the El Salvadoran newspaper El Diario De Hoy, the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches, La Libertad, Ruta Las Flores, Suchitoto, Playa Las Flores in San Miguel, La Palma, Santa Ana (location of the country’s highest volcano), Nahuizalco, Apaneca, Juayua, and San Ignacio.[84]\n Infrastructure Water supply and sanitation Main article: Water supply and sanitation in El Salvador \n The level of access to water supply and sanitation has been increased significantly. A 2015 conducted study by the University of North Carolina called El Salvador the country that has achieved the greatest progress in the world in terms of increased access to water supply and sanitation and the reduction of inequity in access between urban and rural areas.[85] However, water resources are seriously polluted and a large part of the wastewater discharged into the environment without any treatment. Institutionally a single public institution is both de facto in charge of setting sector policy and of being the main service provider. Attempts at reforming and modernizing the sector through new laws have not borne fruit over the past 20 years. \n Demographics Main article: Demographics of El Salvador \n    Population in El Salvador[3]    Year  Million    1950 2.2    2000 5.8    2016 6.3     El Salvador’s population was 6,344,722 in 2016,[3] compared to 2,200,000 in 1950. In 2010 the percentage of the population below the age of 15 was 32.1%, 61% were between 15 and 65 years of age, while 6.9% were 65 years or older.[86]\n The capital city of San Salvador has a population of about 2.1 million people. An estimated 42% of El Salvador’s population live in rural areas. Urbanization has expanded at a phenomenal rate in El Salvador since the 1960s, with millions moving to the cities and creating associated problems for urban planning and services. \n There are up to 100,000 Nicaraguans living in El Salvador.[87]\n Ethnic groups     \n Salvadoran model Irma Dimas was crowned Miss El Salvador in 2005. She made headlines recently for her entry into Salvadoran politics.\n \n \n \n El Salvador’s population is composed of Mestizos, whites, and indigenous peoples. Eighty-six percent of Salvadorans are of mestizo ancestry, having mixed indigenous and European ancestry.[88] In the mestizo population, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as Afro-Salvadoran, and the indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages or have an indigenous culture, all identify themselves as being culturally mestizo.[89]\n 12.7% of Salvadorans are white. A majority of Central European immigrants in El Salvador arrived during World War II as refugees from the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Switzerland. There are also a small community of Jews, Palestinian Christians, and Arab Muslims (in particular Palestinians). \n 0.23% of the population are of full indigenous origin, the ethnic groups are Kakawira which represents 0.07% of the total country’s population, then (Pipil) 0.06%, (Lenca) 0.04% and others minors groups 0.06%. Very few Amerindians have retained their customs and traditions, having over time assimilated into the dominant Mestizo/Spanish culture.[90]\n There is a small Afro-Salvadoran that is 0.13% of the total population, with Blacks having traditionally been prevented from immigrating via government policies.[91][92]\n Among the immigrant groups in El Salvador, Palestinian Christians stand out.[93] Though few in number, their descendants have attained great economic and political power in the country, as evidenced by the election of ex-president Antonio Saca, whose opponent in the 2004 election, Schafik Handal, was also of Palestinian descent, and the flourishing commercial, industrial, and construction firms owned by this ethnic group. \n As of 2004[update], there were approximately 3.2 million Salvadorans living outside El Salvador, with the United States traditionally being the destination of choice for Salvadoran economic migrants. By 2012, there were about 2.0 million Salvadoran immigrants and Americans of Salvadoran descent in the U.S.,[94][95] making them the sixth largest immigrant group in the country.[96] The second destinatation of Salvadorans living outside is Guatemala, with more than 111,000 persons, mainly in Guatemala City. Salvadorans also live in other nearby countries such as Belize, Honduras and Nicaragua.[97] Other countries with notable Salvadoran communities include Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom (including the Cayman Islands), Sweden, Brazil, Italy, Colombia, and Australia. \n     \n Salvadorans\n \n \n \n Languages Spanish is the official language and is spoken by virtually all inhabitants. Some indigenous people speak their native tongues (such as Nawat and Maya), but indigenous Salvadorans who do not identify as mestizo constitute only 1% of the country’s population. However, all of them can speak Spanish. Q’eqchi’ is spoken by immigrants of Guatemalan and Belizean indigenous people living in El Salvador. There have also been recent large migrations of Hondurans and Nicaraguans into the country.[98]\n The local Spanish vernacular is called Caliche. Salvadorans use voseo, which is also used in Argentina, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Uruguay. This refers to the use of “vos” as the second person pronoun, instead of “tú”. “Caliche” is considered informal, and a few people choose not to use it. Nawat is an indigenous language that has survived, though it is only used by small communities of some elderly Salvadorans in western El Salvador. \n Largest cities Further information: List of cities in El Salvador \n      \n   v\n t\n e\n  \n  Largest cities or towns in El Salvador 2007 El Salvador Bureau of Statistics estimate[99] \n \n     Rank   Name   Department  Pop.

Roman Catholics (47%) and Protestants (33%) are the two major religious groups in the country, with the Catholic Church the largest denomination.[100] Those not affiliated with any religious group amount to 17% of the population.[100] The remainder of the population (3%) is made up of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Hare Krishnas, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Latter-day Saints, and those adhering to indigenous religious beliefs.[100] The number of evangelicals in the country is growing rapidly.[101] However, according to a 2017 poll, Evangelicals have dropped to 28% while the unaffiliated or those who register “no religion” have grown to 30%.[102]\n Health See Health in El Salvador \n Education Further information: Education in El Salvador \n     \n Dr. Prudencio Llach Observatory\n \n \n \n The public education system in El Salvador is severely lacking in resources. Class sizes in public schools can be as large as 50 children per classroom. Salvadorans who can afford the cost often choose to send their children to private schools, which are regarded as being better-quality than public schools. Most private schools follow American, European or other advanced systems. Lower-income families are forced to rely on public education.[citation needed]\n Education in El Salvador is free through high school. After nine years of basic education (elementary–middle school), students have the option of a two-year high school or a three-year high school. A two-year high school prepares the student for transfer to a university. A three-year high school allows the student to graduate and enter the workforce in a vocational career, or to transfer to a university to further their education in their chosen field.[103]\n Universities in El Salvador include a central public institution, the Universidad de El Salvador, and many other specialised private universities. \n Crime Main article: Crime in El Salvador \n     \n National Civil Police of El Salvador helicopter\n \n \n \n Since the early twenty-first century, El Salvador has experienced high crime rates, including gang-related crimes and juvenile delinquency.[104]\n El Salvador has the highest murder rate in the world.[105] It is also considered an epicenter of a gang crisis, along with Guatemala and Honduras.[106] In response to this, the government has set up countless programs to try to guide the youth away from gang membership; so far its efforts have not produced any quick results. One of the government programs was a gang reform called “Super Mano Dura” (Super Firm Hand). Super Mano Dura had little success and was highly criticized by the UN. It saw temporary success in 2004 but then saw a rise in crime after 2005. In 2004, the rate of intentional homicides per 100,000 citizens was 41, with 60% of the homicides committed being gang-related.[106]\n The Salvadoran government reported that the Super Mano Dura gang legislation led to a 14% drop in murders in 2004. However, El Salvador had 66 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2012, more than triple the rate in Mexico that year.[107][108][109] There are an estimated 25,000 gang members at large in El Salvador with another 9,000 in prison.[107] The most well-known gangs, called “maras” in colloquial Spanish, are Mara Salvatrucha and their rivals Barrio 18. Maras are hunted by death squads including Sombra Negra. New rivals also include the rising mara, The Rebels 13.[110]\n As of March 2012[update], El Salvador has seen a 40% drop in crime due to what the Salvadoran government called a gang truce; however, extortions affecting small businesses are not taken into account. In early 2012, there were on average of 16 killings per day; in late March of that year that number dropped to fewer than 5 per day. On April 14, 2012 for the first time in over 3 years there were no killings in El Salvador.[111] Overall, there were 411 killings in January 2012, and in March the number was 188, more than a 40% reduction,[112] while crime in neighboring Honduras had risen to an all-time high.[113] In 2014, crime rose 56% in El Salvador, with the government attributing the rise to a break in the truce between the two major gangs in El Salvador, which began having turf wars.[114]\n Presently, the Alto al Crimen or Crime Stoppers program is in operation and provides financial rewards for information leading to the capture of gang leadership. The reward often ranges between US$100 and $500 per call.[115]\n Culture Main article: Culture of El Salvador \n     \n The iconic statue of Christ on the globe sphere of planet earth is part of the Monumento al Divino Salvador del Mundo (Monument to the Divine Savior of the world) on Plaza El Salvador del Mundo (The Savior of the World Plaza), a landmark located in the country’s capital, San Salvador.\n \n \n \n Mestizo culture dominates the country, heavy in both Native American Indigenous and European Spanish influences. A new composite population was formed as a result of intermarrying between the native Mesoamerican population of Cuzcatlan with the European settlers. The Catholic Church plays an important role in the Salvadoran culture. Archbishop Óscar Romero is a national hero for his role in resisting human rights violations that were occurring in the lead-up to the Salvadoran Civil War.[116] Significant foreign personalities in El Salvador were the Jesuit priests and professors Ignacio Ellacuría, Ignacio Martín-Baró, and Segundo Montes, who were murdered in 1989 by the Salvadoran Army during the height of the civil war. \n Painting, ceramics and textiles are the principal manual artistic mediums. Writers Francisco Gavidia (1863–1955), Salarrué (Salvador Salazar Arrué) (1899–1975), Claudia Lars, Alfredo Espino, Pedro Geoffroy Rivas, Manlio Argueta, José Roberto Cea, and poet Roque Dalton are among the most important writers from El Salvador. Notable 20th-century personages include the late filmmaker Baltasar Polio, female film director Patricia Chica, artist Fernando Llort, and caricaturist Toño Salazar. \n Amongst the more renowned representatives of the graphic arts are the painters Augusto Crespin, Noe Canjura, Carlos Cañas, Giovanni Gil, Julia Díaz, Mauricio Mejia, Maria Elena Palomo de Mejia, Camilo Minero, Ricardo Carbonell, Roberto Huezo, Miguel Angel Cerna, (the painter and writer better known as MACLo), Esael Araujo, and many others.

Cuisine Main article: Salvadoran cuisine \n     \n Pupusas, the national and most famous dish of El Salvador.\n \n \n \n     \n Sopa de pata \n \n \n \n One of El Salvador’s notable dishes is the pupusa. Pupusas are handmade corn tortillas (made of masa de maíz or masa de arroz, a maize or rice flour dough used in Latin American cuisine) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as quesillo, similar to mozzarella), chicharrón, or refried beans. Sometimes the filling is queso con loroco (cheese combined with loroco, a vine flower bud native to Central America).[117]\n Pupusas revueltas are pupusas filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer pupusas stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name pupusa comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, pupushahua. The precise origins of the pupusa are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.[117]\n Two other typical Salvadoran dishes are yuca frita and panes con pollo. Yuca frita is deep fried cassava root served with curtido (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with pescaditas (fried baby sardines). The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. Pan con pollo/pavo (bread with chicken/turkey) are warm turkey or chicken-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with Pipil spices and handpulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with tomato and watercress along with cucumber, onion, lettuce, mayonnaise, and mustard. \n One of El Salvador’s typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States. \n Alguashte, a condiment made from dried, ground pepitas, is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes. \n “Maria Luisa” is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar. \n A popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is Horchata, a drink native to the Valencian Community in Spain. Horchata is most commonly made of the morro seed ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. Horchata is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of pupusas or fried yuca. Horchata from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican horchata, which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.[118]\n Other popular drinks in El Salvador include Ensalada, a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and Kolachampan, a sugar cane-flavored carbonated beverage. \n One of the most popular desserts is the cake Pastel de tres leches (Cake of three milks), consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream. \n Music Main article: Music of El Salvador \n Salvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous Lenca, Maya, Cacaopera, Pipil and Spanish influences. Music includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate Christmas and other holidays, especially feast days of the saints). Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. Cuban, Colombian, and Mexican music has infiltrated the country, especially salsa and cumbia. Popular music in El Salvador uses marimba, tehpe’ch, flutes, drums, scrapers and gourds, as well as more recently imported guitars and other instruments. El Salvador’s well known folk dance is known as Xuc which originated in Cojutepeque, Cuscatlan. Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and canciones. \n Sport     \n The Estadio Cuscatlán in San Salvador is the largest stadium in Central America\n \n \n \n Main article: Sport in El Salvador \n Football is the most popular sport in El Salvador. The El Salvador national football team qualified for the FIFA World Cup in 1970 and 1982. Their qualification for the 1970 tournament was marred by the Football War, a war against Honduras, whose team El Salvador’s had defeated. \n The national football team play at the Estadio Cuscatlán in San Salvador. It opened in 1976 and seats 53,400, making it the largest stadium in Central America and the Caribbean.[119]\n See also    Central America portal \n  Latin America portal \n  El Salvador portal \n  \n  Index of El Salvador-related articles\n Outline of El Salvador\n  \n References    ^ “CIA The World Factbook: People and Society – El Salavador”..mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output q{quotes:”””””””‘””‘”}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(“//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png”)no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(“//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png”)no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(“//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png”)no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em} \n  ^ David Scott FitzGerald (22 April 2014).

It consists of two major islands, Antigua and Barbuda, and a number of smaller islands (including Great Bird, Green, Guiana, Long, Maiden and York Islands and further south, the island of Redonda). The permanent population numbers about 81,800 (at the 2011 Census) and the capital and largest port and city is St. John’s on Antigua. Lying near each other (the main Barbuda airport is less than 0.5° of latitude, or 30 nautical miles, north of the main Antigua airport), Antigua and Barbuda are in the middle of the Leeward Islands, part of the Lesser Antilles, roughly at 17°N of the equator. \n The island of Antigua was explored by Christopher Columbus in 1493 and named for the Church of Santa María La Antigua.[5] Antigua was colonized by Britain in 1632; Barbuda island was first colonized in 1678.[6] Antigua and Barbuda joined the West Indies Federation in 1958.[7] With the breakup of the federation, it became one of the West Indies Associated States in 1967.[8] Following by self-governing on its internal affairs, independence was granted from United Kingdom on November 1 1981. \n It remains a member of the Commonwealth and Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state.[9]\n   Contents  \n \n   1 Etymology \n  2 History \n  3 Geography   3.1 Largest cities \n  3.2 Islands \n  3.3 Climate \n  3.4 Ecology \n  \n  4 Demographics   4.1 Ethnic groups \n  4.2 Languages \n  4.3 Religion \n  \n  5 Governance   5.1 Political system \n  5.2 Elections   5.2.1 Party elections \n  \n  5.3 Judiciary \n  5.4 Foreign relations \n  5.5 Military \n  5.6 Administrative divisions \n  \n  6 Economy \n  7 Education \n  8 Culture   8.1 Festivals \n  8.2 Cuisine \n  8.3 Media \n  8.4 Literature \n  \n  9 Sports \n  10 Notables \n  11 Symbols \n  12 See also \n  13 References \n  14 External links \n  \n  Etymology[edit]\n  Antigua is Spanish for “ancient” and barbuda is Spanish for “bearded”. The island of Antigua was originally called Wadadli by Arawaks and is locally known by that name today; Caribs possibly called it Wa’omoni. Christopher Columbus, while sailing by in 1493 may have named it Santa Maria la Antigua, after an icon in the Spanish Seville Cathedral. \n  History[edit]\n      \n   This section needs additional citations for verification.

(October 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) \n     Main article: History of Antigua and Barbuda \n Antigua was first settled by archaic age hunter-gatherer Amerindians called the Ciboney.[10]Carbon dating has established the earliest settlements started around 3100 BC. They were succeeded by the ceramic age pre-Columbian Arawak-speaking Saladoid people who migrated from the lower Orinoco River. \n The Arawaks introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous Antigua black pineapple (Moris cultivar of Ananas comosus), corn, sweet potatoes, chiles, guava, tobacco, and cotton. \n The indigenous West Indians made excellent seagoing vessels which they used to sail around on the Atlantic and the Caribbean. As a result, Caribs and Arawaks were able to colonize much of South America and the Caribbean Islands. Their descendants still live there, notably in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. \n Most Arawaks left Antigua around 1100 AD; those who remained were later raided by the Caribs. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the Caribs’ superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most of the West Indian Arawak nations, enslaving some and possibly cannibalising others. \n     \n Antigua in 1823\n \n \n \n The Catholic Encyclopedia makes it clear that the European invaders had difficulty differentiating between the various groups of the native peoples they encountered. As a result, the number and types of ethnic/tribal groups in existence at that time may have been much more varied and numerous than just the two mentioned in this article. \n European and African diseases, malnutrition, and slavery eventually killed most of the Caribbean’s native population. Smallpox was probably the greatest killer.[11] Some historians[who?] believe that the psychological stress of slavery may also have played a part in the massive number of deaths amongst enslaved natives. Others believe the reportedly abundant but starchy, low-protein diet may have contributed to their severe malnutrition as they were used to a diet fortified with protein from the sea.[12]\n The Spaniards did not colonise Antigua because it lacked fresh water but not aggressive Caribs. The English settled on Antigua in 1632; Christopher Codrington settled on Barbuda in 1684. Slavery, established to run sugar plantations around 1684, was abolished in 1834. The British ruled from 1632 to 1981, with a brief French interlude in 1666. \n The islands became an independent state within the Commonwealth of Nations on 1 November 1981, with Elizabeth II as the first Queen of Antigua and Barbuda. Vere Cornwall Bird Sr became the first Prime Minister. \n Most of Barbuda was devastated in early September 2017 by Hurricane Irma, which brought winds with speeds reaching 295 km/h (185 mph). The storm damaged or destroyed 95% of the island’s buildings and infrastructure, leaving Barbuda “barely habitable” according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne. Nearly everyone on the island was evacuated to Antigua.[13]\n  Geography[edit]\n  Main article: Geography of Antigua and Barbuda \n     \n A map of Antigua and Barbuda\n \n \n \n     \n English Harbour, Antigua\n \n \n \n Antigua and Barbuda both are generally low-lying islands whose terrain has been influenced more by limestone formations than volcanic activity. The highest point on Antigua is Mount Obama (formerly Boggy Peak), the remnant of a volcanic crater rising 402 metres (1,319 feet). \n The shorelines of both islands are greatly indented with beaches, lagoons, and natural harbours. The islands are rimmed by reefs and shoals. There are few streams as rainfall is slight. Both islands lack adequate amounts of fresh groundwater. \n  Largest cities[edit]\n  Further information: List of cities in Antigua and Barbuda \n  Islands[edit]\n       \n  Antigua\n \n \n  \n  Barbuda\n \n \n  \n  Redonda\n \n \n \n   \n Antigua and Barbuda\n \n \n \n      Antigua17°5′0′′N 61°48′0′′W﻿ / ﻿17.08333°N 61.80000°W﻿ / 17.08333; -61.80000\n     Prickly Pear Island17°10′33′′N 61°47′53′′W﻿ / ﻿17.17583°N 61.79806°W﻿ / 17.17583; -61.79806 \n  Great Bird Island17°8′46′′N 61°43′31′′W﻿ / ﻿17.14611°N 61.72528°W﻿ / 17.14611; -61.72528 \n  Galley Island Major17°08′35.5′′N 61°43′37.5′′W﻿ / ﻿17.143194°N 61.727083°W﻿ / 17.143194; -61.727083 \n Galley Island Minor\n Jenny Island\n  Exchange Island17°08′11′′N 61°43′23′′W﻿ / ﻿17.13639°N 61.72306°W﻿ / 17.13639; -61.72306 \n  Rabbit Island17°8′10′′N 61°43′52′′W﻿ / ﻿17.13611°N 61.73111°W﻿ / 17.13611; -61.73111 \n  Lobster Island17°8′1′′N 61°43′47′′W﻿ / ﻿17.13361°N 61.72972°W﻿ / 17.13361; -61.72972 \n  Long Island17°9′19′′N 61°45′14′′W﻿ / ﻿17.15528°N 61.75389°W﻿ / 17.15528; -61.75389 \n  Maiden Island17°8′44′′N 61°45′48′′W﻿ / ﻿17.14556°N 61.76333°W﻿ / 17.14556; -61.76333 \n  Rat Island17°7′44′′N 61°46′11′′W﻿ / ﻿17.12889°N 61.76972°W﻿ / 17.12889; -61.76972 \n  Little Bird Island17°09′27′′N 61°44′17′′W﻿ / ﻿17.15750°N 61.73806°W﻿ / 17.15750; -61.73806 \n  Hells Gate Island17°8′26′′N 61°43′18′′W﻿ / ﻿17.14056°N 61.72167°W﻿ / 17.14056; -61.72167 \n Monocle Point Island\n  Red Head Island17°8′16′′N 61°43′41′′W﻿ / ﻿17.13778°N 61.72806°W﻿ / 17.13778; -61.72806 \n  Guiana Island17°7′26′′N 61°43′57′′W﻿ / ﻿17.12389°N 61.73250°W﻿ / 17.12389; -61.73250 \n  Crump Island17°6′32′′N 61°43′8′′W﻿ / ﻿17.10889°N 61.71889°W﻿ / 17.10889; -61.71889 \n  Nanny Island (Henry Island)17°04′05′′N 61°41′26′′W﻿ / ﻿17.06806°N 61.69056°W﻿ / 17.06806; -61.69056 \n  Laviscounts Island17°5′57′′N 61°43′24′′W﻿ / ﻿17.09917°N 61.72333°W﻿ / 17.09917; -61.72333 \n  Bird Island17°4′45′′N 61°40′20′′W﻿ / ﻿17.07917°N 61.67222°W﻿ / 17.07917; -61.67222 \n Round Island\n  Hawes Island17°6′46′′N 61°43′40′′W﻿ / ﻿17.11278°N 61.72778°W﻿ / 17.11278; -61.72778 \n Little Island\n  Green Island17°4′11′′N 61°39′58′′W﻿ / ﻿17.06972°N 61.66611°W﻿ / 17.06972; -61.66611 \n  Pelican Island17°06′21′′N 61°42′17′′W﻿ / ﻿17.10583°N 61.70472°W﻿ / 17.10583; -61.70472 \n  York Island17°3′11′′N 61°40′9′′W﻿ / ﻿17.05306°N 61.66917°W﻿ / 17.05306; -61.66917 \n  Codrington Island17°6′9′′N 61°42′21′′W﻿ / ﻿17.10250°N 61.70583°W﻿ / 17.10250; -61.70583 \n  \n      Blake Island17°0′52′′N 61°46′58′′W﻿ / ﻿17.01444°N 61.78278°W﻿ / 17.01444; -61.78278 \n  Cinnamon Island17°7′21′′N 61°47′9′′W﻿ / ﻿17.12250°N 61.78583°W﻿ / 17.12250; -61.78583 \n  Five Islands17°04′50′′N 61°54′50′′W﻿ / ﻿17.08056°N 61.91389°W﻿ / 17.08056; -61.91389 \n  Hawksbill Rock17°6′43′′N 61°54′8′′W﻿ / ﻿17.11194°N 61.90222°W﻿ / 17.11194; -61.90222 \n  Johnson Island17°01′31′′N 61°53′28′′W﻿ / ﻿17.02528°N 61.89111°W﻿ / 17.02528; -61.89111 \n  Maiden Island17°5′44′′N 61°53′14′′W﻿ / ﻿17.09556°N 61.88722°W﻿ / 17.09556; -61.88722 \n  Moor Rock17°09′49′′N 61°45′27.0′′W﻿ / ﻿17.16361°N 61.757500°W﻿ / 17.16361; -61.757500 \n  Mouse Island17°07′42.0′′N 61°46′13′′W﻿ / ﻿17.128333°N 61.77028°W﻿ / 17.128333; -61.77028 \n  Neck of Land17°03′40′′N 61°40′29′′W﻿ / ﻿17.06111°N 61.67472°W﻿ / 17.06111; -61.67472 \n  Sandy Island17°8′4′′N 61°55′36′′W﻿ / ﻿17.13444°N 61.92667°W﻿ / 17.13444; -61.92667 \n  Smith Island17°2′27′′N 61°40′48′′W﻿ / ﻿17.04083°N 61.68000°W﻿ / 17.04083; -61.68000 \n  The Sisters17°9′39′′N 61°52′6′′W﻿ / ﻿17.16083°N 61.86833°W﻿ / 17.16083; -61.86833 \n  Vernon’s Island17°6′51′′N 61°46′8′′W﻿ / ﻿17.11417°N 61.76889°W﻿ / 17.11417; -61.76889 \n  Wicked Will Island17°02′53.5′′N 61°40′19.5′′W﻿ / ﻿17.048194°N 61.672083°W﻿ / 17.048194; -61.672083 \n  Barbuda17°37′0′′N 61°48′0′′W﻿ / ﻿17.61667°N 61.80000°W﻿ / 17.61667; -61.80000\n   Goat Island17°42′20′′N 61°50′49′′W﻿ / ﻿17.70556°N 61.84694°W﻿ / 17.70556; -61.84694 \n  Kid Island17°41′47′′N 61°48′52′′W﻿ / ﻿17.69639°N 61.81444°W﻿ / 17.69639; -61.81444 \n  Man of War Island17°40′5′′N 61°51′5′′W﻿ / ﻿17.66806°N 61.85139°W﻿ / 17.66806; -61.85139 \n  Rabbit Island17°42′23′′N 61°49′36′′W﻿ / ﻿17.70639°N 61.82667°W﻿ / 17.70639; -61.82667 \n  Redonda16°56′20′′N 62°20′30′′W﻿ / ﻿16.93889°N 62.34167°W﻿ / 16.93889; -62.34167\n     \n  Climate[edit]\n  Rainfall averages 990 mm (39 in) per year, with the amount varying widely from season to season. In general the wettest period is between September and November. The islands generally experience low humidity and recurrent droughts. Temperatures average 27 °C (80.6 °F), with a range from 23 °C (73.4 °F) to 29 °C (84.2 °F) in the winter to from 25 °C (77.0 °F) to 30 °C (86.0 °F) in the summer and autumn. The coolest period is between December and February. \n Hurricanes strike on an average of once a year, including the powerful Category 5 Hurricane Irma, on 6 September 2017, which damaged 95% of the structures on Barbuda.[14] Some 1,800 people were evacuated to Antigua.[15]\n An estimate published by Time indicated that over $100 million would be required to rebuild homes and infrastructure. Philmore Mullin, Director of Barbuda’s National Office of Disaster Services, said that “all critical infrastructure and utilities are non-existent – food supply, medicine, shelter, electricity, water, communications, waste management”. He summarised the situation as follows: “Public utilities need to be rebuilt in their entirety… It is optimistic to think anything can be rebuilt in six months … In my 25 years in disaster management, I have never seen something like this.”[16]\n  Ecology[edit]\n  The sandy soil on much of the islands has only scrub vegetation. Some parts of Antigua are more fertile–most notably the central plain–due to the volcanic ash in the soil. These areas support some tropical vegetation and agricultural uses. The planting of acacia, mahogany, and red and white cedar on Antigua has led to as much as 11% of the land becoming forested, helping to conserve the soil and water. \n  Demographics[edit]\n  Main article: Demographics of Antigua and Barbuda \n     \n Antigua &amp; Barbuda’s population (1961–2010). Number of inhabitants in thousands.\n \n \n \n  Ethnic groups[edit]\n  Antigua has a population of 100,963,[2] mostly made up of people of West African, British, and Madeiran descent. The ethnic distribution consists of 91% Black &amp; Mulatto, 4.4% mixed race, 1.7% White, and 2.9% other (primarily East Indian and other Asian). Most Whites are of Irish or British descent. Christian Levantine Arabs, and a small number of Asians and Sephardic Jews make up the remainder of the population. \n An increasingly large percentage of the population lives abroad, most notably in the United Kingdom (Antiguan Britons), United States and Canada. A minority of Antiguan residents are immigrants from other countries, particularly from Dominica, Guyana and Jamaica, and, increasing, from the Dominican Republic, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Nigeria. An estimated 4,500 American citizens also make their home in Antigua and Barbuda, making their numbers one of the largest American populations in the English-speaking Eastern Caribbean.[17]\n  Languages[edit]\n  English is the official language. The Barbudan accent is slightly different from the Antiguan. \n In the years before Antigua and Barbuda’s independence, Standard English was widely spoken in preference to Antiguan Creole. Generally, the upper and middle classes shun Antiguan Creole. The educational system dissuades the use of Antiguan Creole and instruction is done in Standard (British) English. \n Many of the words used in the Antiguan dialect are derived from British as well as African languages. This can be easily seen in phrases such as: “Ent it?” meaning “Ain’t it?” which is itself dialectal and means “Isn’t it?”. Common island proverbs can often be traced to Africa. \n Spanish is spoken by around 10,000 inhabitants.[18]\n  Religion[edit]\n      \n St. John’s Cathedral, St. John’s \n \n \n \n A majority of 77%[19] of Antiguans are Christians, with the Anglicans (17,6%) being the largest single denomination. Other Christian denominations present are Seventh-day Adventist Church (12,4%), Pentecostalism (12,2%), Moravian Church (8,3%), Roman Catholics\n (8,2%), Methodist Church (5,6%), Wesleyan Holiness Church (4,5%), Church of God (4,1%), Baptists (3,6%), Mormonism (&lt;1.0%), as well as Jehovah’s Witnesses. \n Non-Christian religions practiced in the islands include the Rastafari, Islam, and Bahá’í Faith. \n  Governance[edit]\n   Political system[edit]\n  Main article: Politics of Antigua and Barbuda \n     \n Downtown St. John’s on Antigua.\n \n \n \n The politics of Antigua and Barbuda take place within a framework of a unitary, parliamentary, representative democratic monarchy, in which the Head of State is the Monarch who appoints the Governor General as vice-regal representative.[20]Elizabeth II is the present Queen of Antigua and Barbuda, having served in that position since the islands’ independence from the United Kingdom in 1981. The Queen is currently represented by Governor General Sir Rodney Williams. A Council of Ministers is appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister, currently Gaston Browne (2014–). The Prime Minister is the Head of Government. \n Executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in both the government and the two Chambers of Parliament. The bicameral Parliament consists of the Senate (17 members appointed by members of the government and the opposition party, and approved by the Governor-General), and the House of Representatives (17 members elected by first past the post) to serve five-year terms. \n The current Leader of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition is the United Progressive Party Member of Parliament (MP), the Honourable Baldwin Spencer. \n  Elections[edit]\n      \n St. John’s parish on Antigua.\n \n \n \n The last elections held were on 12 June 2014, during which the Antigua Labour Party won 14 seats, and the United Progressive Party 3 seats. \n Since 1949, elections have been won by the populist Antigua Labour Party. However, in the Antigua and Barbuda legislative election of 2004 saw the defeat of the longest-serving elected government in the Caribbean. Prime Minister Lester Bryant Bird, who had succeeded his father Vere Cornwall Bird Sr., and Deputy Robin Yearwood had been in office since 1976. \n The elder Bird was Prime Minister from 1981 to 1994 and Chief Minister of Antigua from 1960 to 1981, except for the 1971–1976 period when the Progressive Labour Movement (PLM) defeated his party. Vere Cornwall Bird, the nation’s first Prime Minister, is credited with having brought Antigua and Barbuda and the Caribbean into a new era of independence. \n  Party elections[edit]\n  Gaston Browne defeated his predecessor Lester Bryant Bird at the Antigua Labour Party’s biennial convention in November 2012 held to elect a political leader and other officers. The party then altered its name from the Antigua Labour Party (ALP) to the Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party (ABLP). This was done to officially include the party’s presence on the sister island of Barbuda in its organisation, the only political party on the mainland to have a physical branch in Barbuda. \n  Judiciary[edit]\n  The Judicial branch is the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (based in Saint Lucia; one judge of the Supreme Court is a resident of the islands and presides over the High Court of Justice). Antigua is also a member of the Caribbean Court of Justice. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council serves as its Supreme Court of Appeal.[21]\n  Foreign relations[edit]\n  Main article: Foreign relations of Antigua and Barbuda \n Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the United Nations, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Caribbean Community, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the Organization of American States, the World Trade Organization and the Eastern Caribbean’s Regional Security System. \n Antigua and Barbuda is also a member of the International Criminal Court (with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of Protection for the US military as covered under Article 98 of the Rome Statute). \n In 2013, Antigua and Barbuda called for reparations for slavery at the United Nations. Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer said “We have recently seen a number of leaders apologising”, and that they should now “match their words with concrete and material benefits.”[22]\n  Military[edit]\n  Further information: Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force \n The Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force has around 260 members dispersed between the line infantry regiment, service and support unit and coast guard. There is also the Antigua and Barbuda Cadet Corps made up of 200 teenagers between the ages of 12 to 18. \n  Administrative divisions[edit]\n  Main article: Parishes and dependencies of Antigua and Barbuda \n Antigua and Barbuda is divided into six parishes and two dependencies: \n     \n Parishes of Antigua\n \n \n \n      Parishes  Saint George\n Saint John\n Saint Mary\n Saint Paul\n Saint Peter\n Saint Philip\n  \n Dependencies  Barbuda\n Redonda\n  \n         \n BARBUDA\n REDONDA\n Saint Mary\n Saint John\n St. George\n St. Peter\n St. Philip\n Saint Paul\n ANTIGUA\n CARIBBEAN SEA\n \n         Note: Though Barbuda and Redonda are called dependencies they are integral parts of the state, making them essentially administrative divisions. Dependency is simply a title. \n  Economy[edit]\n  Main article: Economy of Antigua and Barbuda \n     \n A proportional representation of Antigua and Barbuda’s exports.\n \n \n \n Tourism dominates the economy, accounting for more than half of the gross domestic product (GDP). Antigua is famous for its many luxury resorts. Weak tourist activity since early 2000 has slowed the economy, however, and squeezed the government into a tight fiscal corner. \n Investment banking and financial services also make up an important part of the economy. Major world banks with offices in Antigua include the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Scotiabank. Financial-services corporations with offices in Antigua include PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has accused the Antigua-based Stanford International Bank, owned by Texas billionaire Allen Stanford, of orchestrating a huge fraud which may have bilked investors of some $8 billion.[23] (check status 20100312) \n The twin-island nation’s agricultural production is focused on its domestic market and constrained by a limited water supply and a labour shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction work. \n Manufacturing is made up of enclave-type assembly for export, the major products being bedding, handicrafts and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialised world, especially in the United States, from which about one-third of all tourists come. \n Following the opening of the American University of Antigua College of Medicine by investor and attorney Neil Simon in 2003, a new source of revenue was established. The university employs many local Antiguans and the approximate 1000 students consume a large amount of the goods and services. \n Antigua and Barbuda also utilizes an economic citizenship program to spur investment into the country. \n  Education[edit]\n  Main article: Education in Antigua and Barbuda \n Antigua &amp; Barbuda has a greater than 90% literacy rate. In 1998, Antigua and Barbuda adopted a national mandate to become the pre-eminent provider of medical services in the Caribbean. As part of this mission, Antigua and Barbuda built the most technologically advanced hospital in the Caribbean, the Mt. St. John Medical Centre. The island of Antigua currently has two foreign-owned for-profit offshore medical schools, the American University of Antigua (AUA),[24] founded in 2004, and The University of Health Sciences Antigua (UHSA),[25] founded in 1982. The island’s medical schools cater mostly to foreign students but contribute to the local economy and health care. \n There is also a government owned state college in Antigua as well as the Antigua and Barbuda Institute of Information Technology (ABIIT) and the Antigua and Barbuda Hospitality Training Institute (ABHTI). The University of the West Indies has a branch in Antigua for local students to continue university studies. \n Antigua has two international primary/secondary schools: CCSET International, which offers the Ontario Secondary School Diploma, and Island Academy, which offers the International Baccalaureate. There are also many other private schools but these institutions tend to follow the same local curriculum (CXCs) as government schools. \n  Culture[edit]\n  See also: Music of Antigua and Barbuda \n The culture is predominantly a mixture of West African and British cultural influences. \n Cricket is the national sport. Other popular sports include football, boat racing and surfing. (Antigua Sailing Week attracts locals and visitors from all over the world). \n Calypso and soca music, both originating primarily out of Trinidad, are important in Antigua and Barbuda.[citation needed][26]\n  Festivals[edit]\n  The national Carnival held each August commemorates the abolition of slavery in the British West Indies, although on some islands, Carnival may celebrate the coming of Lent. Its festive pageants, shows, contests and other activities are a major tourist attraction. \n  Cuisine[edit]\n  Further information: Antigua and Barbuda cuisine \n Corn and sweet potatoes play an important role in Antiguan cuisine. For example, a popular Antiguan dish, Dukuna /ˈduːkuːnɑː/ is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. One of the Antiguan staple foods, fungi /ˈfuːndʒiː/, is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water. \n  Media[edit]\n  There are two daily newspapers: the “Daily Observer” and “Caribbean Times”. The local channel ABS TV 10 is available (it is the only station which shows exclusively local programs). There are also several local and regional radio stations, such as V2C-AM 620, ZDK-AM 1100, VYBZ-FM 92.9, ZDK-FM 97.1, Observer Radio 91.1 FM, DNECA Radio 90.1 FM, Second Advent Radio 101.5 FM, Abundant Life Radio 103.9 FM, Crusader Radio 107.3 FM, Nice FM 104.3 \n  Literature[edit]\n  Antiguan author Jamaica Kincaid has published over 20 works of literature.[27]\n  Sports[edit]\n  See also: Cricket in the West Indies \n     \n The Antigua Recreation Ground.\n \n \n \n The Antigua and Barbuda national cricket team represented the country at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, but Antiguan cricketers otherwise play for the Leeward Islands cricket team in domestic matches and the West Indies cricket team internationally. The 2007 Cricket World Cup was hosted in the West Indies from 11 March to 28 April 2007. \n Antigua hosted eight matches at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, which was completed on 11 February 2007 and can hold up to 20,000 people.\n Antigua is a Host of Stanford Twenty20 – Twenty20 Cricket, a version started by Allen Stanford in 2006 as a regional cricket game with almost all Caribbean islands taking part.\n Rugby and netball are popular as well. \n Association football, or soccer, is also a very popular sport. Antigua has a national football team which entered World Cup qualification for the 1974 tournament and for 1986 and onwards. A professional team was formed in 2011, Antigua Barracuda FC, which played in the USL Pro, a lower professional league in the USA. The nation’s team had a major achievement in 2012, getting out of its preliminary group for the 2014 World Cup, notably due to a victory over powerful Haiti. In its first game in the next CONCACAF group play on 8 June 2012 in Tampa, FL, Antigua and Barbuda, comprising 17 Barracuda players and 7 from the lower English professional leagues, scored a goal against the United States. However, the team lost 3:1 to the US. \n  Notables[edit]\n   Runners Sonia Williams and Heather Samuel represented Antigua and Barbuda at the Olympic Games.\n  Brendan Christian, runner (100 m, 200 m)\n  Daniel Bailey runner (100 m, 200 m)\n  James Grayman high jumper\n  Viv Richards, cricketeer, scored the fastest Test Century\n  Brian Lara, cricketeer, twice scored the World Test Record at the Antigua Recreation Ground.\n Cricketeers Sir Vivian Richards, Andy Roberts, and Richie Richardson \n   Symbols[edit]\n  The national bird is the frigate bird, and the national tree is the Talipariti elatum (Blue Mahoe tree). \n  See also[edit]\n     Caribbean portal \n  Caricom portal \n  Commonwealth realms portal \n  Antigua and Barbuda portal \n  \n  Outline of Antigua and Barbuda\n Index of Antigua and Barbuda-related articles\n Bibliography of Antigua and Barbuda\n  Antigua and Barbuda – Wikipedia book \n  \n  References[edit]\n     ^ “The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency”. www.cia.gov..mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output q{quotes:”””””””‘””‘”}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(“//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png”)no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(“//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png”)no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(“//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png”)no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em} \n  ^ ab “World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision”.

With a population of over 325 million people, the U.S. is the third-most populous country. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the largest city by population is New York City. Forty-eight states and the capital’s federal district are contiguous in North America between Canada and Mexico. The State of Alaska is in the northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia to the west. The State of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine official time zones. The extremely diverse geography, climate, and wildlife of the United States make it one of the world’s 17 megadiverse countries.[19]\n Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago.[20]European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies following the French and Indian War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775, and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power.[21] The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories,[22]displacing Native American tribes, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848.[22] During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery.[23][24] By the end of the century, the United States had extended into the Pacific Ocean,[25] and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.[26] The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country’s status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the 1969 moon landing. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world’s sole superpower.[27] The United States is the world’s oldest surviving federation. It is a representative democracy, “in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law”.[28]\n The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world’s largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP.[29] The U.S. economy is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world.[30] The United States is the world’s largest importer and the second largest exporter of goods.[31][32] Though its population is only 4.3% of the world total,[33] the U.S. holds 33.4% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country.[34] The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage,[35]human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person.[36] The U.S. is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending,[37] and is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[38]\n   Contents  \n \n   1 Etymology \n  2 History   2.1 Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history \n  2.2 European settlements   2.2.1 Effects on and interaction with native populations \n  \n  2.3 Independence and expansion (1776–1865) \n  2.4 Civil War and Reconstruction Era \n  2.5 Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization \n  2.6 World War I, Great Depression, and World War II \n  2.7 Cold War and civil rights era \n  2.8 Contemporary history \n  \n  3 Geography, climate, and environment   3.1 Wildlife \n  \n  4 Demographics   4.1 Population \n  4.2 Language \n  4.3 Religion \n  4.4 Family structure \n  \n  5 Government and politics   5.1 Political divisions \n  5.2 Parties and elections \n  5.3 Foreign relations \n  5.4 Government finance \n  5.5 Military \n  \n  6 Law enforcement and crime \n  7 Economy   7.1 Income, poverty and wealth \n  \n  8 Infrastructure   8.1 Transportation \n  8.2 Energy \n  8.3 Water supply and sanitation \n  \n  9 Education \n  10 Culture   10.1 Food \n  10.2 Literature, philosophy, and visual art \n  10.3 Music \n  10.4 Cinema \n  10.5 Sports \n  10.6 Mass media \n  \n  11 Science and technology \n  12 Health \n  13 See also \n  14 Notes \n  15 References \n  16 Bibliography   16.1 Internet sources \n  \n  17 External links \n  \n Etymology See also: Naming of the Americas, Names for United States citizens, and American (word) \n     \n The Americas are named after Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci.[39] \n \n \n \n In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere America in honor of the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin: Americus Vespucius).[40] The first documentary evidence of the phrase “United States of America” is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., George Washington’s aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army. Addressed to Lt. Col. Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed his wish to carry the “full and ample powers of the United States of America” to Spain to assist in the revolutionary war effort.[41][42][43] The first known publication of the phrase “United States of America” was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[44]\n The second draft of the Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared “The name of this Confederation shall be the ‘United States of America‘“.[45] The final version of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence “The Stile of this Confederacy shall be ‘The United States of America‘“.[46] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA” in all capitalized letters in the headline of his “original Rough draught” of the Declaration of Independence.[45] This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.[45]\n The short form “United States” is also standard. Other common forms are the “U.S.”, the “USA”, and “America”. Colloquial names are the “U.S. of A.” and, internationally, the “States”. “Columbia”, a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the name “District of Columbia”.[47]\n The phrase “United States” was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., “the United States are”—including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865.[48] The singular form—e.g., “the United States is”—became popular after the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom “these United States”. The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.[49]\n A citizen of the United States is an “American”. “United States”, “American” and “U.S.” refer to the country adjectivally (“American values”, “U.S. forces”). In English, the word “American” rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States.[50]\n History Main articles: History of the United States, Timeline of United States history, American business history, Economic history of the United States, and Labor history of the United States \n Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history Further information: History of Native Americans in the United States \n @media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti&gt;.thumbinner{width:100%!important;max-width:none!important}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:none!important;width:100%!important;text-align:center}}\n    \n  Monks Mound in Cahokia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the largest and most influential settlement in Mississippian culture. The concrete staircase follows the approximate course of ancient wooden stairs.\n \n  \n The Cliff Palace, built by the Ancestral Puebloans, is the largest Native cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.\n \n \n \n \n The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[51] After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward, either along the Pacific coast[52][53] or through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets.[54] The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and it is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas.[55] While the Clovis culture was thought, throughout the late 20th century, to represent the first human settlement of the Americas,[56] in recent years consensus has changed in recognition of pre-Clovis cultures.[57]\n Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies.[58] From approximately 800 to 1600 AD[59] the Mississippian culture flourished, and its largest city Cahokia is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States.[60] While in the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloans culture developed.[61] Three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United States are credited to the Pueblos: Mesa Verde National Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, and Taos Pueblo. The earthworks constructed by Native Americans of the Poverty Point culture in northeastern Louisiana have also been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.[62] In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point between the twelfth[63] and fifteenth centuries,[64] lasting until the end of the Revolutionary War.[65]\n The date of the first settlements of the Hawaiian Islands is a topic of continuing debate.[66]Archaeological evidence seems to indicate a settlement as early as 124 AD.[67] During his third and final voyage, Captain James Cook became the first European to begin formal contact with Hawaii.[68] After his initial landfall in January 1778 at Waimea harbor, Kauai, Cook named the archipelago the “Sandwich Islands” after the fourth Earl of Sandwich—the acting First Lord of the Admiralty of the British Royal Navy.[69]\n European settlements Further information: Colonial history of the United States, European colonization of the Americas, and Thirteen Colonies \n     \n Saint Augustine, Florida, the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States (1565)[70] \n \n \n \n     \n The Mayflower Compact, 1620 by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris \n \n \n \n After Spain sent Columbus on his first voyage to the New World in 1492, other explorers followed. The first Europeans to arrive in the territory of the modern United States were Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made his first visit to Florida in 1513; however, if unincorporated territories are accounted for, then credit would go to Christopher Columbus who landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage. The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine[70] and Santa Fe. The French established their own as well along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims’ Plymouth Colony in 1620. Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent’s first elected legislative assembly, Virginia’s House of Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[71][72]\n Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice, and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period, Americans were producing one-seventh of the world’s iron supply.[73] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.[74]\n A large-scale slave trade with English privateers was begun.[75] The life expectancy of slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves.[76][77] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.[78][79] But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.[80]\n With the British colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America were established.[81] All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism.[82] With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.[83] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.[84]\n     \n The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748\n \n \n \n During the Seven Years’ War (in the United States, known as the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[85] The colonies’ distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.[86]\n In 1774, the Spanish Navy ship Santiago, under Juan Pérez, entered and anchored in an inlet of Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, in present-day British Columbia. Although the Spanish did not land, natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from California.[87] At the time, the Spanish were able to monopolize the trade between Asia and North America, granting limited licenses to the Portuguese. When the Russians began establishing a growing fur trading system in Alaska, the Spanish began to challenge the Russians, with Pérez’s voyage being the first of many to the Pacific Northwest.[88][fn 8]\n After having arrived in the Hawaiian islands in 1778, Captain Cook sailed north and then northeast to explore the west coast of North America north of the Spanish settlements in Alta California. He made landfall on the Oregon coast at approximately 44°30′ north latitude, naming his landing point Cape Foulweather. Bad weather forced his ships south to about 43° north before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward.[90] In March 1778, Cook landed on Bligh Island and named the inlet “King George’s Sound”. He recorded that the native name was Nutka or Nootka, apparently misunderstanding his conversations at Friendly Cove/Yuquot; his informant may have been explaining that he was on an island (itchme nutka, a place you can “go around”). There may also have been confusion with Nuu-chah-nulth, the natives’ autonym (a name for themselves). It may also have simply been based on Cook’s mispronunciation of Yuquot, the native name of the place.[91]\n Effects on and interaction with native populations Further information: American Indian Wars, Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas, and James Cook \n     \n Death of Captain Cook by Johann Zoffany (1795)\n \n \n \n With the progress of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced.[92] The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles. Violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline among Native Americans, though conflict among themselves and with Europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial settlements.[93][94][95][96][97][98]\n In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.[99] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans, and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to “civilize” the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.[100][101]\n Captain James Cook’s last voyage included sailing along the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. He returned to Hawaii to resupply, initially exploring the coasts of Maui and the big island, trading with locals and then making anchor at Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. When his ships and company left the islands, a ship’s mast broke in bad weather, forcing them to return in mid-February. Cook would be killed days later.[102][fn 9][fn 10]\n  Independence and expansion (1776–1865)\n  Further information: American Revolutionary War, United States Declaration of Independence, American Revolution, and Territorial evolution of the United States \n     \n Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull \n \n \n \n The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of “republicanism” asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen and “no taxation without representation”. The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.[115]\n Following the passage of the Lee Resolution, on July 2, 1776, which was the actual vote for independence, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, which recognized, in a long preamble, that all men are equal and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great Britain, and declared, in the words of the resolution, that the Thirteen Colonies were independent states and had no allegiance to the British crown in the United States. The fourth day of July is celebrated annually as Independence Day.[116] The Second Continental Congress declared on September 9 “where, heretofore, the words ‘United Colonies’ have been used, the stile be altered for the future to the ‘United States’ “.[117] In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789.[116]\n Britain recognized the independence of the United States following their defeat at Yorktown in 1781.[118] In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[119]\n Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population.[120][121][122] The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[123] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[124]\n     \n Map of the states and territories of the United States, c. 1834\n \n \n \n Americans’ eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars.[125] The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation’s area.[126] The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism.[127] A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[128] The expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America’s large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&amp;M; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation’s land.[129]\n From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider white male suffrage; it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny.[130] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[131] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[132]\n     \n The national mammal, an American bison in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming\n \n \n \n The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration and the creation of additional western states.[133] After the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[134] Over a half-century, the loss of the American bison (sometimes called “buffalo”) was an existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures.[135] In 1869, a new Peace Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship, although conflicts, including several of the largest Indian Wars, continued throughout the West into the 1900s.[136]\n Civil War and Reconstruction Era Further information: American Civil War and Reconstruction Era \n     \n The Battle of Gettysburg by Thure de Thulstrup \n \n \n \n Differences of opinion regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans ultimately led to the American Civil War.[137] Initially, states entering the Union had alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.[138] This led to Missouri’s controversial denouncement of the issue, as well as the formation of many short-lived territories such as the State of Scott, a county that left Tennessee to stay anti-slavery.[139]\n With the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the “South”), while the federal government (the “Union”) maintained that secession was illegal.[138] In order to bring about this secession, military action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind. The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.[140] The South fought for the freedom to own slaves, while the Union at first simply fought to maintain the country as one united whole. Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, the main purpose of the war from the Union’s viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibited slavery. \n Three amendments were added to the U.S. Constitution in the years after the war: the aforementioned Thirteenth as well as the Fourteenth Amendment providing citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,[141] and the Fifteenth Amendment ensuring in theory that African Americans had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power[142] aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the South while guaranteeing the rights of the newly freed slaves. \n Reconstruction began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, an assassin’s bullet on April 14, 1865, drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the Compromise of 1877 when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the presidential election of 1876. \n Southern white Democrats, calling themselves “Redeemers”, took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction. From 1890 to 1910, so-called Jim Crow laws disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region. Blacks faced racial segregation, especially in the South.[143] They also occasionally experienced vigilante violence, including lynching.[144]\n  Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization\n  Main articles: Economic history of the United States and Technological and industrial history of the United States \n     \n Ellis Island, in New York City, was a major gateway for European immigration[145] \n \n \n \n     \n The Statue of Liberty in New York City, dedicated in 1886, is a symbol of the United States as well as its ideals of freedom, democracy, and opportunity.[146] \n \n \n \n In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country’s industrialization and transformed its culture.[147] National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.[148]\n The end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets.[149] Mainland expansion was completed by the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[150] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War.[151]American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War.[152] The United States purchased the U.S. Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917.[153]\n Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation’s progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The American economy boomed, becoming the world’s largest, and the United States achieved great power status.[154] These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[155] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women’s suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.[156][157][158]\n  World War I, Great Depression, and World War II\n  Further information: World War I, Great Depression, and World War II \n     \n Crowd gathering on Wall Street after the 1929 crash\n \n \n \n The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I, in 1914, until 1917 when it joined the war as an “associated power”, alongside the formal Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[159]\n In 1920, the women’s rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women’s suffrage.[160] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television.[161] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system.[162] The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s;[163] whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[164]\n At first effectively neutral during World War II while Germany conquered much of continental Europe, the United States began supplying material to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers.[165] During the war, the United States was referred as one of the “Four Policemen”[166] of Allies power who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union and China.[167][168] Though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,[169] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[170]\n The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences with the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and other Allies, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe’s postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[171] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; causing the Japanese to surrender on September 2, ending World War II.[172][173] Parades and celebrations followed in what is known as Victory Day, or V-J Day.[174]\n Cold War and civil rights era Main articles: History of the United States (1945–64), History of the United States (1964–80), and History of the United States (1980–91) \n Further information: Cold War, Civil Rights Movement, War on Poverty, Space Race, and Reaganomics \n     \n Martin Luther King, Jr. speaking to an anti-Vietnam War rally at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul on April 27, 1967\n \n \n \n     \n U.S. President Ronald Reagan (left) and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, meeting in Geneva in 1985\n \n \n \n After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what became known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism[175] and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict. \n The United States often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored, and occasionally pursued direct action for regime change against left-wing governments.[176] American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–53.[177] The Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a “Space Race” in which the United States became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969.[177] A proxy war in Southeast Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War. \n At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation’s infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[178][179] In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state added to the country.[180] The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination.[181][182][183] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution. \n The launch of a “War on Poverty” expanded entitlements and welfare spending, including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that provide health coverage to the elderly and poor, respectively, and the means-tested Food Stamp Program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.[184]\n The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned “containment” and initiated the more aggressive “rollback” strategy towards the USSR.[185][186][187][188][189] After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[190]\n The late 1980s brought a “thaw” in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.[191][192][193][194] This brought about unipolarity[195] with the U.S. unchallenged as the world’s dominant superpower. The concept of Pax Americana, which had appeared in the post-World War II period, gained wide popularity as a term for the post-Cold War new world order. \n Contemporary history Main articles: History of the United States (1991–2008) and History of the United States (2008–present) \n Further information: Gulf War, September 11 attacks, War on Terror, 2008 financial crisis, and Affordable Care Act \n    \n The World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan during the September 11 terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda in 2001\n \n  \n  One World Trade Center, newly built in its place\n \n \n \n \n After the Cold War, the conflict in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Saddam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.[196]\n Originating in U.S. defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic networks, and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the global economy, society, and culture.[197]\n Due to the dot-com boom, stable monetary policy under Alan Greenspan, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.[198] Beginning in 1994, the U.S. entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade among the three partners has soared since NAFTA went into force.[199]\n On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[200] In response, the United States launched the War on Terror, which included war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.[201][202] In 2007, the Bush administration ordered a major troop surge in the Iraq War,[203] which successfully reduced violence and led to greater stability in the region.[204][205]\n Government policy designed to promote affordable housing,[206] widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance,[207] and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve[208] led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation’s history since the Great Depression.[209]Barack Obama, the first African-American[210] and multiracial[211] president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis,[212] and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements[213] and a relative decline in unemployment.[214] Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection,[215] although there has been debate about its effects on the economy.[216]\n In 2010, the Obama administration passed the Affordable Care Act, which made the most sweeping reforms to the nation’s healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused a significant reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016,[217] but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance.[218] Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama’s policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.[219]\n American forces in Iraq were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and the war in the region was declared formally over in December 2011.[220] The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency,[221] leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region.[222] In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time since 1961.[needs update][223] The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran’s nuclear program,[224] though the U.S. withdrew from the deal in May 2018.[225] In the United States presidential election of 2016, Republican Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States. Trump is both the oldest and wealthiest person elected president in United States history.[226]\n  Geography, climate, and environment\n  Main articles: Geography of the United States, Climate of the United States, and Environment of the United States \n     \n A composite satellite image of the contiguous United States and surrounding areas\n \n \n \n     \n Köppen climate classifications \n \n \n \n The land area of the entire United States is approximately 3,800,000 square miles (9,841,955 km2),[227] with the contiguous United States making up 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940.6 km2) of that. Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856.2 km2). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. The populated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2).[228] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.[229]\n The United States is the world’s third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured.[fn 7] The Encyclopædia Britannica, for instance, lists the size of the United States as 3,677,649 square miles (9,525,067 km2), as they do not count the country’s coastal or territorial waters.[230]The World Factbook, which includes those waters, gives 3,796,742 square miles (9,833,517 km2).[231]\n The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont.[232] The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[233] The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world’s fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[233]\n     \n Highest peak in the country, Denali \n \n \n \n The Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[234] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave.[235] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[236] and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[237] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska’s Denali (Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and North America.[238] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska’s Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent’s largest volcanic feature.[239] The United States has the most ecoregions out of any country in the world.[240]\n The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[241] The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[242] Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world’s tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[243]\n Wildlife Main articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States \n See also: Category:Biota of the United States \n     \n The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782.[244] \n \n \n \n The U.S. ecology is megadiverse: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[245] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species.[246] About 91,000 insect species have been described.[247] The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself.[248]\n There are 59 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[249] Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country’s land area.[250] Most of this is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; about .86% is used for military purposes.[251][252]\n Environmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation,[253][254] and international responses to global warming.[255][256] Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[257] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[258] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.[259]\n Demographics Main articles: Demography of the United States, Americans, and Race and ethnicity in the United States \n Population See also: List of U.S. states by population and List of United States cities by population \n    Historical population    Census Pop.   %±    1790 3,929,214  —   1800 5,308,483  35.1%   1810 7,239,881  36.4%   1820 9,638,453  33.1%   1830 12,866,020  33.5%   1840 17,069,453  32.7%   1850 23,191,876  35.9%   1860 31,443,321  35.6%   1870 38,558,371  22.6%   1880 50,189,209  30.2%   1890 62,979,766  25.5%   1900 76,212,168  21.0%   1910 92,228,496  21.0%   1920 106,021,537  15.0%   1930 123,202,624  16.2%   1940 132,164,569  7.3%   1950 151,325,798  14.5%   1960 179,323,175  18.5%   1970 203,211,926  13.3%   1980 226,545,805  11.5%   1990 248,709,873  9.8%   2000 281,421,906  13.2%   2010 308,745,538  9.7%   Est. 2017[9] 325,719,178  5.5%   1610–1780 population data.[260]\nNote that the census numbers do\nnot include Native Americans until 1860.[261]     The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the country’s population to be 325,719,178 as of July 1, 2017, and to be adding 1 person (net gain) every 13 seconds, or about 6,646 people per day.[33] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from 76.2 million in 1900 to 281.4 million in 2000.[262] The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected.[263] In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children; by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56.[264] Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.86 children per woman in 2014. Foreign-born immigration has caused the US population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign-born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 40 million in 2010, representing one-third of the population increase.[265] The foreign-born population reached 45 million in 2015.[266] The United States has a very diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[267]German Americans are the largest ethnic group (more than 50 million) – followed by Irish Americans (circa 37 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans (circa 28 million).[268][269]\n     \n Most common ancestry in each U.S. state in 2000\n  German   American   Mexican   Irish   African   Italian   English   Japanese   Puerto Rican \n \n \n \n White Americans (mostly European ancestry group with 73,1 % of total population) are the largest racial group; black Americans are the nation’s largest racial minority (note that in the U.S. Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans are counted as an ethnic group, not a “racial” group), and third-largest ancestry group.[267]Asian Americans are the country’s second-largest racial minority; the three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans.[267] According to a 2015 survey, the largest American community with European ancestry is German Americans, which consists of more than 14% of total population.[270] In 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively).[271] The census counted more than 19 million people of “Some Other Race” who were “unable to identify with any” of its five official race categories in 2010, over 18.5 million (97%) of whom are of Hispanic ethnicity.[271]\n The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend. The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent[271] are identified as sharing a distinct “ethnicity” by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent.[272] Between 2000 and 2010, the country’s Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%.[273] Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[274][fn 11]\n Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 37.2% of the population in 2012[280] and over 50% of children under age one,[281][277] and are projected to constitute the majority by 2044.[281]\n The United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world average.[282] Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher than that of many developed nations.[283] In fiscal year 2016, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.[284]Mexico has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every year since the 1990s.[285] As of 2012[update], approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal immigrants.[286] As of 2015[update], 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing.[266]\n According to a survey conducted by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.[287][288] A 2016 Gallup poll also concluded that 4.1% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%.[289] In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.[290]\n About 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs);[231] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[291] The US has numerous clusters of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston).[292] There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million.[293] Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South.[294] The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008.[293]\n  \n     Leading population centers (see complete list)     view\n talk\n edit\n  \n    Rank  Core city (cities)  Metro area population   Metropolitan Statistical Area  Region[295]   \n\nNew York City \nLos Angeles\n \nChicago\n \nDallas\n    1   New York City  20,320,876   New York–Newark–Jersey City, NY–NJ–PA MSA   Northeast    2   Los Angeles  13,353,907   Los Angeles–Long Beach–Anaheim, CA MSA   West    3   Chicago  9,533,040   Chicago–Joliet–Naperville, IL–IN–WI MSA   Midwest    4   Dallas–Fort Worth  7,399,662   Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington, TX MSA   South    5   Houston  6,892,427   Houston–The Woodlands-Sugar Land MSA   South    6   Washington, D.C.  6,216,589   Washington, DC–VA–MD–WV MSA   South    7   Miami  6,158,824   Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach, FL MSA   South    8   Philadelphia  6,096,120   Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington, PA–NJ–DE–MD MSA   Northeast    9   Atlanta  5,884,736   Atlanta–Sandy Springs–Roswell, GA MSA   South    10   Boston  4,836,531   Boston–Cambridge–Quincy, MA–NH MSA   Northeast    11   Phoenix  4,737,270   Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, AZ MSA   West    12   San Francisco  4,727,357   San Francisco–Oakland–Fremont, CA MSA   West    13   Riverside–San Bernardino  4,580,670   Riverside–San Bernardino–Ontario, CA MSA   West    14   Detroit  4,313,002   Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI MSA   Midwest    15   Seattle  3,867,046   Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue, WA MSA   West    16   Minneapolis–St. Paul  3,600,618   Minneapolis–St. Paul–Bloomington, MN–WI MSA   Midwest    17   San Diego  3,337,685   San Diego–Carlsbad–San Marcos, CA MSA   West    18   Tampa–St. Petersburg  3,091,399   Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater, FL MSA   South    19   Denver  2,888,227   Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO MSA   West    20   Baltimore  2,808,175   Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD MSA   South    Based on 2017 MSA population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[296]     \n \n Language Main article: Languages of the United States \n See also: Language Spoken at Home in the United States of America, List of endangered languages in the United States, and Language education in the United States \n English (American English) is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.[297][298] Some Americans advocate making English the country’s official language, as it is in 32 states.[299]\n Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state law.[300]Alaska recognizes twenty Native languages as well as English.[301] While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[302] Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms.[303]\n Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan[304] is officially recognized by American Samoa. Chamorro[305] is an official language of Guam. Both Carolinian and Chamorro have official recognition in the Northern Mariana Islands.[306]\n Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there.[307]\n The most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate studies, are: Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners) include Latin, Japanese, ASL, Italian, and Chinese.[308][309] 18% of all Americans claim to speak at least one language in addition to English.[310]\n  Languages spoken at home by more than 1 million persons in the U.S. (2016)[311][312][fn 12]\n    Language Percent of\npopulation Number of\nspeakers Number who\nspeak English\nvery well Number who\nspeak English\nless than\nvery well     English (only)  ~80% 237,810,023 N/A N/A     Spanish\n(including Spanish Creole but excluding Puerto Rico)  13% 40,489,813 23,899,421 16,590,392     Chinese\n(all varieties, including Mandarin and Cantonese)  1.0% 3,372,930 1,518,619 1,854,311     Tagalog\n(including Filipino)  0.5% 1,701,960 1,159,211 542,749    Vietnamese 0.4% 1,509,993 634,273 875,720     Arabic\n(all varieties)  0.3% 1,231,098 770,882 460,216     French\n(including Patois and Cajun)  0.3% 1,216,668 965,584 251,087    Korean 0.2% 1,088,788 505,734 583,054     Religion Main article: Religion in the United States \n  Religious affiliation in the U.S. (2014)[313]\n    Affiliation  % of U.S. population     Christianity   70.6   70.6  \n  \n     Protestant   46.5   46.5  \n  \n     Evangelical Protestant   25.4   25.4  \n  \n     Mainline Protestant   14.7   14.7  \n  \n     Black church   6.5   6.5  \n  \n     Catholic   20.8   20.8  \n  \n     Mormon   1.6   1.6  \n  \n     Jehovah’s Witnesses   0.8   0.8  \n  \n     Eastern Orthodox   0.5   0.5  \n  \n    Other Christian   0.4   0.4  \n  \n     Judaism   1.9   1.9  \n  \n     Islam   0.9   0.9  \n  \n     Buddhism   0.7   0.7  \n  \n     Hinduism   0.7   0.7  \n  \n    Other faiths   1.8   1.8  \n  \n     Irreligion   22.8   22.8  \n  \n    Nothing in particular   15.8   15.8  \n  \n     Agnostic   4.0   4  \n  \n     Atheist   3.1   3.1  \n  \n    Don’t know or refused answer   0.6   0.6  \n  \n     The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment. \n In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a “very important role in their lives”, a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.[314] In a 2009 Gallup poll, 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.[315]\n As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30.[316] Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion has been declining since the mid to late 1980s,[317] and that younger Americans, in particular, are becoming increasingly irreligious.[313][318] According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time.[319][320] Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.[321]\n According to a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults in the United States identified themselves as Christians;[322]Protestants accounted for 46.5%, while Roman Catholics, at 20.8%, formed the largest single denomination.[323] In 2014, 5.9% of the U.S. adult population claimed a non-Christian religion.[313] These include Judaism (1.9%), Hinduism (1.2%), Buddhism (0.9%), and Islam (0.9%).[313] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion—up from 8.2% in 1990.[323][324][325] There are also Unitarian Universalist, Scientologist, Baha’i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.[326]\n Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States, accounting for almost half of all Americans. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism at 15.4%,[327] and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination at 5.3% of the U.S. population.[327] Apart from Baptists, other Protestant categories include nondenominational Protestants, Methodists, Pentecostals, unspecified Protestants, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, other Reformed, Episcopalians/Anglicans, Quakers, Adventists, Holiness, Christian fundamentalists, Anabaptists, Pietists, and multiple others.[327] Two-thirds of American Protestants consider themselves to be born again.[327]Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin primarily in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas, as well as in the English colony of Maryland.[328] It later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island has the highest percentage of Catholics, with 40 percent of the total population.[329]Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population.[330] The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.[331]Eastern Orthodoxy is claimed by 5% of people in Alaska,[332] a former Russian colony, and maintains a presence on the U.S. mainland due to recent immigration from Eastern Europe. Finally, a number of other Christian groups are active across the country, including the Oneness Pentecostals, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Restorationists, Churches of Christ, Christian Scientists, Unitarians and many others. \n The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation’s average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.[315]\n Family structure Main article: Family structure in the United States \n As of 2007[update], 58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 25% had never been married.[333] Women now work mostly outside the home and receive a majority of bachelor’s degrees.[334]\n The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991.[335] In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, and the lowest in Wyoming.[335][336]Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[337] In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.[338]\n The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2016 was 1.82 births per 1000 woman.[339]Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).[340] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[341]Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide and it is legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[342]\n Government and politics Main articles: Federal government of the United States, State governments of the United States, Local government in the United States, and Elections in the United States \n    \n The United States Capitol,\nwhere Congress meets:\nthe Senate, left; the House, right\n \n  \n The White House, home and workplace of the U.S. President \n \n  \n  Supreme Court Building, where the nation’s highest court sits\n \n \n \n The United States is the world’s oldest surviving federation. It is a representative democracy, “in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law”.[28] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country’s supreme legal document.[343] For 2016, the U.S. ranked 21st on the Democracy Index[344] (tied with Italy) and 18th on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[345]\n In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government’s duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is rare at lower levels.[346]\n The federal government is composed of three branches: \n   Legislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[347] and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[348] \n  Executive: The President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to Congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.[349] \n  Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the President with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[350] \n  The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census, seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, had 53.[351] The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories each have one member of Congress — these members are not allowed to vote.[352]\n The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one-third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories do not have senators.[352] The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[353] The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[354]\n The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature.[355] The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote. \n The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the “great writ” of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[356] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans’ individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[357] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[358]\n Political divisions Main articles: Political divisions of the United States, U.S. state, Territories of the United States, List of states and territories of the United States, and Indian reservation \n Further information: Territorial evolution of the United States and United States territorial acquisitions \n     \n Map of U.S. Economic Exclusion Zone,[359] highlighting states, territories and possessions\n \n \n \n The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[360][361][362] The states and territories are the principal administrative districts in the country. These are divided into subdivisions of counties and independent cities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, Washington DC.[363] The states and the District of Columbia choose the President of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their Representatives and Senators in Congress; the District of Columbia has three (because of the 23rd Amendment).[364]Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico do not have presidential electors, and so people in those territories cannot vote for the president.[352]\n Congressional Districts are reapportioned among the states following each decennial Census of Population. Each state then draws single-member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The total number of voting Representatives is 435. There are also 6 non-voting representatives who represent the District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories.[365]\n The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states’ sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they have a great deal of autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.[366]\n Citizenship is granted at birth in all states, the District of Columbia, and all major U.S. territories except American Samoa.[367][368]\n      State flags and statehood dates\n     \n     (listed alphabetically)\n          Alabama: Dec. 14, 1819\n   Alaska: Jan. 3, 1959\n   Arizona: Feb. 14, 1912\n   Arkansas: Jun. 15, 1836\n   California: Sep. 9, 1850\n   Colorado: Aug. 1, 1876\n   Connecticut: Jan. 9, 1788\n   Delaware: Dec. 7, 1787\n   Florida: Mar. 3, 1845\n   Georgia: Jan. 2, 1788\n   Hawaii: Aug. 21, 1959\n   Idaho: Jul. 3, 1890\n   Illinois: Dec. 3, 1818\n   Indiana: Dec. 11, 1816\n   Iowa: Dec. 28, 1846\n   Kansas: Jan. 29, 1861\n   Kentucky: Jun. 1, 1792\n   Louisiana: Apr. 30, 1812\n   Maine: Mar. 15, 1820\n   Maryland: Apr. 28, 1788\n   Massachusetts: Feb. 6, 1788\n   Michigan: Jan. 26, 1837\n   Minnesota: May 11, 1858\n   Mississippi: Dec. 10, 1817\n   Missouri: Aug. 10, 1821\n   Montana: Nov. 8, 1889\n   Nebraska: Mar. 1, 1867\n   Nevada: Oct. 31, 1864\n   New Hampshire: Jun. 21, 1788\n   New Jersey: Dec. 18, 1787\n   New Mexico: Jan. 6, 1912\n   New York: Jul. 26, 1788\n   North Carolina: Nov. 21, 1789\n   North Dakota: Nov. 2, 1889\n   Ohio: Mar. 1, 1803\n   Oklahoma: Nov. 16, 1907\n   Oregon: Feb. 14, 1859\n   Pennsylvania: Dec. 12, 1787\n   Rhode Island: May 29, 1790\n   South Carolina: May 23, 1788\n   South Dakota: Nov. 2, 1889\n   Tennessee: Jun. 1, 1796\n   Texas: Dec. 29, 1845\n   Utah: Jan. 4, 1896\n   Vermont: Mar. 4, 1791\n   Virginia: Jun. 25, 1788\n   Washington: Nov. 11, 1889\n   West Virginia: Jun. 20, 1863\n   Wisconsin: May 29, 1848\n   Wyoming: Jul. 10, 1890\n  \n \n     \n     \n     (listed chronologically)\n        Dec. 7, 1787:  Delaware \n Dec. 12, 1787:  Pennsylvania \n Dec. 18, 1787:  New Jersey \n Jan. 2, 1788:  Georgia \n Jan. 9, 1788:  Connecticut \n Feb. 6, 1788:  Massachusetts \n Apr. 28, 1788:  Maryland \n May 23, 1788:  South Carolina \n Jun. 21, 1788:  New Hampshire \n Jun. 25, 1788:  Virginia \n Jul. 26, 1788:  New York \n Nov. 21, 1789:  North Carolina \n May 29, 1790:  Rhode Island \n Mar. 4, 1791:  Vermont \n Jun. 1, 1792:  Kentucky \n Jun. 1, 1796:  Tennessee \n Mar. 1, 1803:  Ohio \n Apr. 30, 1812:  Louisiana \n Dec. 11, 1816:  Indiana \n Dec. 10, 1817:  Mississippi \n Dec. 3, 1818:  Illinois \n Dec. 14, 1819:  Alabama \n Mar. 15, 1820:  Maine \n Aug. 10, 1821:  Missouri \n Jun. 15, 1836:  Arkansas \n Jan. 26, 1837:  Michigan \n Mar. 3, 1845:  Florida \n Dec. 29, 1845:  Texas \n Dec. 28, 1846:  Iowa \n May 29, 1848:  Wisconsin \n Sep. 9, 1850:  California \n May 11, 1858:  Minnesota \n Feb. 14, 1859:  Oregon \n Jan. 29, 1861:  Kansas \n Jun. 20, 1863:  West Virginia \n Oct. 31, 1864:  Nevada \n Mar. 1, 1867:  Nebraska \n Aug. 1, 1876:  Colorado \n Nov. 2, 1889:  North Dakota \n Nov. 2, 1889:  South Dakota \n Nov. 8, 1889:  Montana \n Nov. 11, 1889:  Washington \n Jul. 3, 1890:  Idaho \n Jul. 10, 1890:  Wyoming \n Jan. 4, 1896:  Utah \n Nov. 16, 1907:  Oklahoma \n Jan. 6, 1912 :  New Mexico \n Feb. 14, 1912 :  Arizona \n Jan. 3, 1959:  Alaska \n Aug. 21, 1959:  Hawaii \n  \n \n     \n      Statehood date is the date of ratifying the Constitution (for the first 13) or being admitted to the Union (for subsequent states) \n     \n      Territory and district flags and dates\n     \n     (listed alphabetically)\n          American Samoa: Apr. 17, 1900\n   District of Columbia: Jul. 16, 1790\n   Guam: Apr. 11, 1899\n   Northern Mariana Islands: Nov. 3, 1986\n   Puerto Rico: Apr. 11, 1899\n   US Virgin Islands: Mar. 31, 1917\n  \n \n     \n     \n     (listed chronologically)\n        Jul. 16, 1790:  District of Columbia \n Apr. 11, 1899:  Guam \n Apr. 11, 1899:  Puerto Rico \n Apr. 17, 1900:  American Samoa \n Mar. 31, 1917:  US Virgin Islands \n Nov. 3, 1986:  Northern Mariana Islands \n  \n \n     \n     Territory date is the date the territory was acquired by the United States, except for the District of Columbia, which was founded separately\n     \n Parties and elections Main articles: Politics of the United States and Political ideologies in the United States \n     \n Congressional leadership meeting with then-President Obama in 2011.[369] \n \n \n \n    \n  Donald Trump\n45th President\nsince January 20, 2017 \n \n  \n  Mike Pence\n48th Vice President\nsince January 20, 2017 \n \n \n \n \n The United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its history.[370] For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.[371]\n Within American political culture, the center-right Republican Party is considered “conservative” and the center-left Democratic Party is considered “liberal”.[372][373] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as “blue states”, are relatively liberal. The “red states” of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative. \n Republican Donald Trump, the winner of the 2016 presidential election, is serving as the 45th President of the United States.[374] Leadership in the Senate includes Republican Vice President Mike Pence, Republican President Pro Tempore Orrin Hatch, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.[375] Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[376]\n In the 115th United States Congress, both the House of Representatives and the Senate are controlled by the Republican Party. The Senate consists of 51 Republicans, and 47 Democrats with 2 Independents who caucus with the Democrats; the House consists of 241 Republicans and 194 Democrats.[377] In state governorships, there are 33 Republicans, 16 Democrats, and 1 Independent.[378] Among the DC mayor and the 5 territorial governors, there are 2 Republicans, 1 Democrat, 1 New Progressive, and 2 Independents.[379][380]\n Foreign relations Main articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States \n     \n The United Nations Headquarters was built in Midtown Manhattan in 1952.[381] \n \n \n \n The United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters. It is a member of the G7,[382]G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military equipment).[383]\n The United States has a “Special Relationship” with the United Kingdom[384] and strong ties with Canada,[385]Australia,[386]New Zealand,[387]the Philippines,[388]Japan,[389]South Korea,[390]Israel,[391] and several European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance, the most in the world. As a share of America’s large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast, private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.[392]\n The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau. These are Pacific island nations, once part of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands after World War II, which gained independence in subsequent years.[393]\n On October 25, 2017, Vice President Mike Pence announced at a In Defense of Christians annual dinner meeting in Washington that the United States would stop funding United Nations relief efforts, cases tackling the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, but insisted that the U.S. would instead help and aid Christians directly through the United States Agency for International Development.[394] Pence said that he will be visiting the Middle East in December and will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss peace agreements.[395][396]\n Government finance See also: Taxation in the United States and United States federal budget \n     \n U.S. federal debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, from 1790 to 2013.[397] \n \n \n \n Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state, and local government levels. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. It is one of only two countries in the world that taxes its citizens no matter where they reside in the world (although considerable income earned abroad is excluded from taxes). The other country is Eritrea.[398] In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[399] During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%).[400] Based on CBO estimates,[401] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.[402]\n U.S. taxation has historically been generally progressive, especially the federal income taxes, though by most measures it became noticeably less progressive after 1980.[403][404] It has sometimes been described as among the most progressive in the developed world, but this characterization is controversial.[405][406][407][408][404] The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes,[409] and about half of all taxes.[410] Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[411][412] The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[413][414] However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.[415]\n The top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes.[416] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile.[417][418] The incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades.[408][419] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.[408][420]\n During FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare &amp; Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).[400]\n The total national debt of the United States in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP) in 2014.[421][fn 13]\n Military Main article: United States Armed Forces \n     \n The carrier strike groups of the Kitty Hawk, Ronald Reagan, and Abraham Lincoln with aircraft from the Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force.\n \n \n \n The President holds the title of commander-in-chief of the nation’s armed forces and appoints its leaders, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[426]\n Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.[427] American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force’s large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy’s 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy’s Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad,[428] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[429]\n The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[430] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA.[431] Defense’s share of U.S. spending has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.[432]\n     \n US global military presence.\n \n \n \n The proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.[433] The last American troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011;[434] 4,484 service members were killed during the Iraq War.[435] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012;[436] by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan.[437]\n Law enforcement and crime Main articles: Law enforcement in the United States and Crime in the United States \n See also: Law of the United States, Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, Human rights in the United States § Justice system, Incarceration in the United States, and Capital punishment in the United States \n     \n Law enforcement in the U.S. is maintained primarily by local police departments. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country.\n \n \n \n Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police and sheriff’s departments, with state police providing broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts’ rulings and federal laws.[438] At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.[439]\n In 2015, there were 15,696 murders which was 1,532 more than in 2014, a 10.8% increase, the largest since 1971.[440] The murder rate in 2015 was 4.9 per 100,000 people.[441] In 2016 the murder rate increased by 8.6%, with 17,250 murders that year.[442] The national clearance rate for homicides in 2015 was 64.1%, compared to 90% in 1965.[443] In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980.[444] In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other developed nations.[445] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States “homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.”[446]Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject of contentious political debate. \n From 1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of homicide victims and 90% of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites (“whites” includes most Hispanics), and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims killed by whites.[447] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.[448] The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes.[449]\n Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and used in 31 states.[450][451] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.[452] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.[453]\n The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and largest prison population in the world.[454] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults.[455] In December 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision in December 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997.[456] The prison population has quadrupled since 1980,[457] and state and local spending on prisons and jails has grown three times as much as that spent on public education during the same period.[458] However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013[459] and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012.[460] The country’s high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies.[461] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[462] The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been a subject of debate.[463][464] In 2013, Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate (1,082 per 100,000 people),[465][466] and Maine the lowest (285 per 100,000 people).[465][467] Among the U.S. territories, the highest incarceration rate was in the U.S. Virgin Islands (542 per 100,000 people) and the lowest was in Puerto Rico (313 per 100,000 people).[468][469]\n Economy Main article: Economy of the United States \n See also: Economic history of the United States \n    Economic indicators    Nominal GDP  $18.45 trillion (Q2 2016)  [470]   Real GDP growth 3.0% (Q3 2017)  [470]    2.6% (2015)  [471]    CPI inflation 2.2% (September 2017)  [472]   Employment-to-population ratio 60.2% (October 2017)  [473]   Unemployment 4.1% (October 2017)  [474]    Labor force participation rate 62.7% (November 2017)  [475]   Total public debt $19.808 trillion (October 25, 2016)  [476]   Household net worth $96.196 trillion (Q2 2017)  [477]    The United States has a capitalist mixed economy[478] which is fueled by abundant natural resources and high productivity.[479] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[480]\n The nominal GDP of the U.S. is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014[update][481] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[482] The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita according to the United Nations (first in the Americas)[483] and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP.[480] The U.S. dollar is the world’s primary reserve currency.[484]\n The United States is the largest importer of goods and second-largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.[485]Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.[486] In 2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the country’s largest export.[485] Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt.[487] The largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve, who hold the majority of the debt.[488][489][490][491][fn 14]\n In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%.[494] The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1.[495] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power.[496] The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing.[497] In the franchising business model, McDonald’s and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the world.[498]\n Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field.[499] The United States is the largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its second-largest importer.[500] It is the world’s number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The National Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium, copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, titanium and others.[501][502]\n Agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP,[496] yet the United States is the world’s top producer of corn[503] and soybeans.[504] The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food, representing half of the world’s biotech crops.[505]\n Consumer spending comprises 68% of the U.S. economy in 2015.[506] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe.[507] The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers.[508] The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to.[509]\n The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation[510] and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia.[511] While federal law does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations.[512] 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits.[512] In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.[513]\n The 2008–2012 global recession significantly affected the United States, with output still below potential according to the Congressional Budget Office.[514] It brought high unemployment (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising petroleum and food prices. \n  Income, poverty and wealth\n      \n A tract housing development in San Jose, California \n \n \n \n Further information: Income in the United States, Poverty in the United States, Affluence in the United States, United States counties by per capita income, and Income inequality in the United States \n Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD nations, and in 2007 had the second-highest median household income.[515][516][517] According to the Census Bureau, median household income was $59,039 in 2016.[518] Accounting for 4.4% of the global population, Americans collectively possess 41.6% of the world’s total wealth,[519] and Americans make up roughly half of the world’s population of millionaires.[520] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[521] Americans on average have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and more than every EU nation.[522] For 2013 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 5th among 187 countries in its Human Development Index and 28th in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[523]\n After years of stagnant growth, in 2016, according to the Census, median household income reached a record high after two consecutive years of record growth, although income inequality remains at record highs with top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income.[518] There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[524] However, the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance.[525] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected income inequality,[526] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[527] According to a 2018 study by the OECD, the United States has much higher income inequality and a larger percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation. This is largely because at-risk workers get almost no government support and are further set back by a very weak collective bargaining system.[528] The top 1 percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers,[529] The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.[530][531]\n   United States’ families median net worth\n  source: Fed Survey of Consumer Finances[532]\n    in 2013 dollars 1998 2013 change    All families $102,500 $81,200 -20.8%    Bottom 20% of incomes $8,300 $6,100 -26.5%    2nd lowest 20% of incomes $47,400 $22,400 -52.7%    Middle 20% of incomes $76,300 $61,700 -19.1%    Top 10% $646,600 $1,130,700 +74.9%     Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country’s household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.[533] According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country’s wealth in 2016.[534] Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[535] Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down $14 trillion, but has since increased $14 trillion over 2006 levels.[536][537] At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to $11.8 trillion,[538] down from $13.8 trillion at the end of 2008.[539]\n There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[540] In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic.[541] According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty, up from one in seven in 1980.[542] As of September 2017, 40 million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, with 18.5 million of those living in deep poverty (a family income below one-half of the poverty threshold). In 2016, 13.3 million children were living in poverty, which made up 32.6% of the impoverished population.[543]\n In 2017, the region with the lowest poverty rate was New Hampshire (7.3%), and the region with the highest poverty rate was American Samoa (65%).[544][545][546] Among the states, the highest poverty rate was in Mississippi (21.9%).[547] According to the UN, around five million people in the U.S. live in “third world” conditions.[548]\n Infrastructure Transportation Main article: Transportation in the United States \n     \n The Interstate Highway System, which extends 46,876 miles (75,440 km).[549] \n \n \n \n     \n Class 1 freight rail-lines in North America\n \n \n \n Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads,[550] including one of the world’s longest highway systems at 57,000 mi (91,700 km).[551] The world’s second-largest automobile market,[552] the United States has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (1996).[553] About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.[554] The average American adult (accounting for all drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling 29 miles (47 km).[555] In 2017, there were 255,009,283 motor vehicles—including cars, vans, buses, freight, and other trucks, but excluding motorcycles and other two-wheelers—or 910 vehicles per 1,000 people.[556][556]\n     \n Map showing Amtrak (passenger) rail speeds in the United States.[557] \n \n \n \n Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips.[558][559]Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, partly because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior.[560][561] However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010.[562] Also, light rail development has increased in recent years.[563] Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.[564]\n The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while\n most major airports are publicly owned.[565] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[566] Of the world’s 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and the fourth-busiest, O’Hare International Airport in Chicago.[567] In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks of 2001, the Transportation Security Administration was created to police airports and commercial airliners. \n Energy Further information: Energy policy of the United States \n     \n The U.S. power transmission grid consists of about 300,000 km (190,000 mi) of lines operated by approximately 500 companies. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) oversees all of them.\n \n \n \n The United States energy market is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year.[568]Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons (7076 kg) of oil equivalent per year, the 10th-highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[569] The United States is the world’s largest consumer of petroleum.[570] The United States has 27% of global coal reserves.[571] It is the world’s largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.[572]\n For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception in the wake of a 1979 accident. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants were filed.[573]\n Water supply and sanitation Main article: Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States \n Issues that affect water supply in the United States include droughts in the West, water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.[574][575][fn 15]\n Education Main article: Education in the United States \n     \n The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of the many public universities in the United States. Universal government-funded education exists in the United States, while there are also many privately funded institutions.\n \n \n \n American public education is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[578]\n About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[579] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student.[580] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[581]\n The United States has many competitive private and public institutions of higher education. The majority of the world’s top universities listed by different ranking organizations are in the U.S.[582][583][584] There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor’s degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[585] The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.[231][586] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[587]\n As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[580][588] As of 2012[update], student loan debt exceeded one trillion dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards.[589]\n Culture Main article: Culture of the United States \n The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[590][591] Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries.[592] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[590][593] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[590]\n Core American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism,[594] as well as a unifying belief in an “American creed” emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[595] Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times the French figure of 0.14%.[596][597]\n The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[598] Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate.[599][600][601][602][482][603] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[604] scholars identify significant differences between the country’s social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[605] Americans’ self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree.[606] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.[607]\n Food Main article: Cuisine of the United States \n     \n Apple pie is a food commonly associated with American cuisine.\n \n \n \n Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour[608] and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers.[609] These homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America’s most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[610]\n     \n Roasted turkey is a traditional menu item of an American Thanksgiving dinner.[611] \n \n \n \n Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[612] Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea.[613] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[614][615]\n American eating habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary roots with some variations. Although American lands could grow newer vegetables that Britain could not, most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by Europeans.[616] Over time American foods changed to a point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in 1972: “Our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence”.[617]\n The American fast food industry, the world’s largest,[618] pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s.[619] Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans’ caloric intake rose 24%;[612] frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American “obesity epidemic”.[620] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake.[621]\n  Literature, philosophy, and visual art\n  Main articles: American literature, American philosophy, Architecture of the United States, and Visual art of the United States \n     \n Mark Twain, American author and humorist.\n \n \n \n In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century’s second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[622] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)—may be dubbed the “Great American Novel”.[623]\n Twelve U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Bob Dylan in 2016. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[624] Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[625]\n The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have affected various fields in social and political philosophy.[626][627]\n In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[628]Georgia O’Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[629] Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.[630]\n     \n Times Square in New York City, the hub of the Broadway theater district[631] \n \n \n \n One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O’Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.[632]\n Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance, while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet. \n Music Main articles: Music of the United States and American classical music \n Though little known at the time, Charles Ives’s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. \n The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[633]\n Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[634][635][636] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America’s most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk. \n More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities,[633] as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Eminem and Kanye West.[637]\n Cinema Main article: Cinema of the United States \n     \n The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California\n \n \n \n Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[638] The world’s first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison’s Kinetoscope.[639] The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film’s development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[640]\n Director D. W. Griffith, the top American filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[641] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West and history, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting, with great influence on subsequent directors. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the “Golden Age of Hollywood”, from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[642] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[643][644] In the 1970s, film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were a vital component in what became known as “New Hollywood” or the “Hollywood Renaissance”,[645] grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[646] Since, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs, and in return, high earnings at the box office, with Cameron’s Avatar (2009) earning more than $2 billion.[647]\n Notable films topping the American Film Institute’s AFI 100 list include Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time,[648][649]Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler’s List (1993), Singin’ in the Rain (1952), It’s a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).[650] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[651] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[652]\n Sports Main article: Sports in the United States \n    \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n The most popular American sports are American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey[653] \n \n \n     \n All Cities in the US and Canada with at least one team in the MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL or NHL, 2018\n \n \n \n American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport;[654] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally. Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country’s next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different but overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.[655] In soccer, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men’s national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women’s team has won the FIFA Women’s World Cup three times; Major League Soccer is the sport’s highest league in the United States (featuring 19 American and 3 Canadian teams).\n The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[656]\n Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States (2028 Summer Olympics will mark the ninth time). As of 2017, the United States has won 2,522 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 305 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.[657]\n While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[658] The most watched individual sports are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.[659][660]Rugby union is considered the fastest growing sport in the U.S., with registered players, numbered at 115,000+ and a further 1.2 million participants.[661]\n Mass media Main article: Media of the United States \n     \n The corporate headquarters of the American Broadcasting Company in New York City\n \n \n \n The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox. The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[662] Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[663]\n In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other.) As of September 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[664]\n Well-known newspapers include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and USA Today.[665] Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have “alternative weeklies” to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City’s The Village Voice or Los Angeles’ LA Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.[666] Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon, and Twitter.[667]\n More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[668][669]\n Science and technology Main articles: Science and technology in the United States and Science policy of the United States \n     \n Astronaut James Irwin walking on the Moon next to Apollo 15’s landing module and lunar rover in 1971. The effort to reach the Moon was triggered by the Space Race.\n \n \n \n The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor-saving techniques created the system called mass production.[670]\n In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison’s research laboratory, one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[671] The latter led to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[672]\n The rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[673] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and aeronautics.[674][675]\n The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[676][677][678] This, in turn, led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.[679]\n These advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for individual use.[680] As of 2013[update], 83.8% of American households owned at least one computer, and 73.3% had high-speed Internet service.[681] 91% of Americans also own a mobile phone as of May 2013[update].[682] The United States ranks highly with regard to freedom of use of the internet.[683]\n In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector.[684] The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.[685]\n Health See also: Health care in the United States, Health care reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States \n     \n Massachusetts General Hospital is one of the oldest health-care institutions in the United States\n \n \n \n The United States has a life expectancy of 79.8 years at birth, up from 75.2 years in 1990.[686][687][688] Life expectancy ranged from a high of 81.3 years in Hawaii to a low of 73.4 years in American Samoa.[689][690] The infant mortality rate of 6.17 per thousand places the United States 56th-lowest out of 224 countries.[691]\n Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere contributed to lowering the country’s rank in life expectancy from 11th in the world in 1987, to 42nd in 2007.[692] Obesity rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years, are the highest in the industrialized world, and are among the highest anywhere.[693][694] Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight.[695] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.[696]\n In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer’s disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[688] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[697]\n The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the European Union and Switzerland together contributed to five.[698] Since 1966, more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.[699] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.[700]\n Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance.[701] The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[702][703] In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[704]Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014,[needs update] though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.[705][706]\n See also    United States portal \n  \n       Book: United States\n       Index of United States-related articles\n Lists of U.S. state topics\n Outline of the United States\n  Notes    ^ 36 U.S.C. § 302  \n  ^ English is the official language of 32 states; English and Hawaiian are both official languages in Hawaii, and English and 20 Indigenous languages are official in Alaska. Algonquian, Cherokee, and Sioux are among many other official languages in Native-controlled lands throughout the country. French is a de facto, but unofficial, language in Maine and Louisiana, while New Mexico law grants Spanish a special status.[4][5] \n  ^ In five territories, English as well as one or more indigenous languages are official: Spanish in Puerto Rico, Samoan in American Samoa, Chamorro in both Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Carolinian is also an official language in the Northern Mariana Islands. \n  ^ See Time in the United States for details about laws governing time zones in the United States. \n  ^ Except the U.S. Virgin Islands. \n  ^ The five major territories are American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. There are eleven smaller island areas without permanent populations: Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, and Palmyra Atoll. U.S. sovereignty over Bajo Nuevo Bank, Navassa Island, Serranilla Bank, and Wake Island is disputed.[14] \n  ^ ab The Encyclopædia Britannica lists China as the world’s third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) with a total area of 9,572,900 sq km,[15] and the United States as fourth-largest at 9,526,468 sq km. The figure for the United States is less than in the CIA World Factbook because it excludes coastal and territorial waters.[16] The CIA World Factbook lists the United States as the third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) with total area of 9,833,517 sq km,[17] and China as fourth-largest at 9,596,960 sq km.[18] This figure for the United States is greater than in the Encyclopædia Britannica because it includes coastal and territorial waters.\n \n \n  ^ Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska to assert its long-held claim over the Pacific Northwest, which dated back to the 16th century. During the decade 1785–1795 British merchants, encouraged by Sir Joseph Banks and supported by their government, made a sustained attempt to develop this trade despite Spain’s claims and navigation rights. The endeavors of these merchants did not last long in the face of Spain’s opposition. The challenge was also opposed by a Japan holding obdurately to national seclusion.[89] \n  ^ His previous arrival coincided with the Makahiki,[103] a festival celebrating the Hawaiian deity Lono.[104] After HMS Resolution and HMS Discovery had left the islands, the season for battle and war had begun under the worship and rituals for Kūkaʻilimoku, the Hawaiian deity of war.[105] \n  ^ On the evening of February 13, while anchored in Kealakekua Bay after their return, one of only two long boats was stolen.[106] The Hawaiians had begun to openly challenge the foreigners. In retaliation, Cook tried to take the aliʻi nui of the island of Hawaii, Kalaniʻōpuʻu as ransom for the boats.[107] The following morning of February 14, 1779[108] Cook and his men went directly to Kalaniʻōpuʻu’s enclosure where the monarch was still sleeping.[109] One of ruler’s wives, Kānekapōlei pleaded with them to stop.[110] Cook’s men and the Marines were confronted on the beach by thousands of Native Hawaiians.[111] Cook tried to move the elderly man but he refused. As the townspeople began to surrounding them, Cook and his men raised their guns. Two chiefs and the monarch’s wife shielded Kalaniʻōpuʻu as Cook tried to force him to his feet.[112] The crowd became hostile and Kanaʻina (one of the monarch’s attendants) approached Cook, who reacted by striking him with the broad side of his sword. Kanaʻina instantly grabbed Cook and lifted him off his feet.[113] Kanaʻina released Cook, who fell to the ground as another attendant, Nuaa fatally stabbed Cook to death.[114]\n \n  ^ Fertility is also a factor; in 2010 the average Hispanic woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her lifetime, compared to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic white women (both below the replacement rate of 2.1).[275]Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 36.3% of the population in 2010 (this is nearly 40% in 2015),[276] and over 50% of children under age one,[277] and are projected to constitute the majority by 2042.[278] This contradicts the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports, based on the U.S. census data, which concludes that 54% (2,162,406 out of 3,999,386 in 2010) of births were non-Hispanic white.[275] The Hispanic birth rate plummeted 25% between 2006 and 2013 while the rate for non-Hispanics decreased just 5%.[279] \n  ^ Source: 2015 American Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau. Most respondents who speak a language other than English at home also report speaking English “well” or “very well” For the language groups listed above, the strongest English-language proficiency is among speakers of German (96% report that they speak English “well” or “very well”), followed by speakers of French (93.5%), Tagalog (92.8%), Spanish (74.1%), Korean (71.5%), Chinese (70.4%), and Vietnamese (66.9%). \n  ^ In January 2015, U.S. federal government debt held by the public was approximately $13 trillion, or about 72% of U.S. GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5 trillion, giving a combined total debt of $18.080 trillion.[422][423] By 2012, total federal debt had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP.[424] The U.S. has a credit rating of AA+ from Standard &amp; Poor’s, AAA from Fitch, and AAA from Moody’s.[425] \n  ^ The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, found that the United States’ arms industry was the world’s biggest exporter of major weapons from 2005 to 2009,[492] and remained the largest exporter of major weapons during a period between 2010 and 2014, followed by Russia, China (PRC), and Germany.[493] \n  ^ Droughts are likely to particularly affect the 66 percent of Americans whose communities depend on surface water.[576] As for drinking water quality, there are concerns about disinfection by-products, lead, perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances, but generally drinking water quality in the U.S. is good.[577] \n  \n References     ^ George McKenna 2007, p. 280. \n  ^ Kidder &amp; Oppenheim 2007, p. 91. \n  ^ “uscode.house.gov”.

title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\" class=IPA>[panaˈma]</span>), officially the <b>Republic of Panama</b> (Spanish: <i>República de Panamá</i>), is a country in Central America,<sup id=cite_ref-8 class=reference>[8]</sup> bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half the country’s 4 million people.<sup id=cite_ref-UN_WPP_3-1 class=reference>[3]</sup></p>\n <p>Panama was inhabited by indigenous tribes before Spanish colonists arrived in the 16th century. It broke away from Spain in 1821 and joined the Republic of Gran Colombia, a union of Nueva Granada, Ecuador, and Venezuela. After Gran Colombia dissolved in 1831, Panama and Nueva Granada eventually became the Republic of Colombia. With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the construction of the Panama Canal to be completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. The 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties led to the transfer of the Canal from the United States to Panama on December 31, 1999.<sup id=cite_ref-cia_9-0 class=reference>[9]</sup></p>\n <p>Revenue from canal tolls continues to represent a significant portion of Panama’s GDP, although commerce, banking, and tourism are major and growing sectors. In 2015 Panama ranked 60th in the world in terms of the Human Development Index.<sup id=cite_ref-HDI10_10-0 class=reference>[10]</sup> Since 2010, Panama has been the second-most competitive economy in Latin America, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index. Covering around 40 percent of its land area, Panama’s jungles are home to an abundance of tropical plants and animals – some of them found nowhere else on the planet.<sup id=cite_ref-11 class=reference>[11]</sup> Panama is a founding member of the United Nations and other international organizations such as OAS, LAIA, G77, WHO and NAM. </p>\n <div id=toc class=toc> <div

There are several theories. One postulates that the country was named after a commonly found species of tree (<i>Sterculia apetala</i>, the Panama tree). Another that the first settlers arrived in Panama in August, when butterflies abound, and that the name means “many butterflies” in one or several of indigenous Amerindian languages that were spoken in the territory prior to Spanish colonization. Most scientifically corroborated theory, that by Panamanian linguists, states that the word is a hispanicization of Kuna language word “<i>bannaba</i>” which means “distant” or “far away”.<sup id=cite_ref-PAN_12-0 class=reference>[12]</sup></p>\n <p>A commonly relayed legend in Panama is that there was a fishing village that bore the name “Panamá”, which purportedly meant “an abundance of fish”, when the Spanish colonizers first landed in the area. The exact location of the village is unspecified. The legend is usually corroborated by Captain Antonio Tello de Guzmán’s diary entries, who reports landing at an unnamed village while exploring the Pacific coast of Panama in 1515; he only describes the village as a “same small indigenous fishing town”. In 1517, Don Gaspar de Espinosa, a Spanish lieutenant, decided to settle a post in the same location Guzmán described. In 1519, Pedrarias Dávila decided to establish the Spanish Empire’s Pacific port at the site.

The existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people, agriculture and technology throughout the American continent from the appearance of the first hunters and collectors to the era of villages and cities.<sup id=cite_ref-Mayo,_J_2004_14-0 class=reference>[14]</sup><sup id=cite_ref-15 class=reference>[15]</sup></p>\n <p>The earliest discovered artifacts of indigenous peoples in Panama include Paleo-Indian projectile points. Later central Panama was home to some of the first pottery-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at Monagrillo, which date back to 2500–1700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500–900 AD) at the Monagrillo archaeological site, and their beautiful Gran Coclé style polychrome pottery. The monumental monolithic sculptures at the Barriles (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures. </p>\n <p>Before Europeans arrived Panama was widely settled by Chibchan, Chocoan, and Cueva peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the indigenous population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\" style=margin-left:0.1em>[<i><span title=\"Is this an anthropological term?

A year later, Christopher Columbus visited the isthmus, and established a short-lived settlement in the Darien. Vasco Núñez de Balboa’s tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas, and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain’s empire in the New World. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for Spain. The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of Crosses) because of the number of gravesites along the way. </p>\n <p>Panama was under Spanish rule for almost 300 years (1538–1821), and became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of “geographic destiny”, and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned Panamanian nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.<sup id=cite_ref-17 class=reference>[17]</sup><sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\">[<i><span title=\"This citation requires a reference to the specific page or range of pages in which the material appears. (February 2018)\">page needed</span></i>]</sup></p>\n <p>In 1538 the Real Audiencia of Panama was established, initially with jurisdiction from Nicaragua to Cape Horn, until the conquest of Peru. A Real Audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court. Each audiencia had an <i>oidor</i> (Spanish: hearer, a judge). </p>\n <p>Spanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of Panama. Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as “indios de guerra” (war Indians) who resisted Spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them. However, Panama was enormously important to Spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in Peru to Europe. Silver cargoes were landed at Panama and then taken overland to Portobello or Nombre de Dios on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment. </p>\n <p>Because of incomplete Spanish control, the Panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly Dutch and English), and from “new world” Africans called cimarrons who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or <i>palenques</i> around the Camino Real in Panama’s Interior, and on some of the islands off Panama’s Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under Bayano, which emerged in the 1552 to 1558. Sir Francis Drake’s famous raids on Panama in 1572–73 and John Oxenham’s crossing to the Pacific Ocean were aided by Panama cimarrons, and Spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.<sup id=cite_ref-18 class=reference>[18]</sup></p>\n <p>The prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540–1740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the Spanish Empire – the first modern global empire – helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within Panama well before the rest of the colonies. </p>\n <p>The end of the encomienda system in Azuero, however, sparked the conquest of Veraguas in that same year. Under the leadership of Francisco Vázquez, the region of Veraguas passed into Castilian rule in 1558. In the newly conquered region, the old system of encomienda was imposed. On the other hand, the Panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the Azuero Peninsula, set forth by the Spanish Crown, in 1558 because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population. In its stead, a system of medium and smaller-sized landownership was promoted, thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and small-sized proprietors. </p>\n <p>Panama was the site of the ill-fated Darien scheme, which set up a Scottish colony in the region in 1698. This failed for a number of reasons, and the ensuing debt contributed to the union of England and Scotland in 1707.<sup id=cite_ref-19 class=reference>[19]</sup></p>\n <p>In 1671, the privateer Henry Morgan, licensed by the English government, sacked and burned the city of Panama – the second most important city in the Spanish New World at the time. In 1717 the viceroyalty of New Granada (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take Spanish territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of Panama was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada’s capital, Santa Fe de Bogotá (the modern capital of Colombia) proved a greater obstacle than the Spanish crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the viceroyalty of Lima and even by Panama’s own initiative. This uneasy relationship between Panama and Bogotá would persist for centuries. </p>\n <p>In 1744, Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the College of San Ignacio de Loyola and on June 3, 1749, founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier. By this time, however, Panama’s importance and influence had become insignificant as Spain’s power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted ships to round Cape Horn in order to reach the Pacific. While the Panama route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other. </p>\n <h4> <span class=mw-headline id=1800s>1800s</span><span class=mw-editsection><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>[</span>edit<span class=mw-editsection-bracket>]</span></span><br>\n </h4> <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:222px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Arco_chato.jpg/220px-Arco_chato.jpg\" width=220 height=165 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>Santo Domingo Church </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <p>As the Spanish American wars of independence were heating up all across Latin America, Panama City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of Saints), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of Azuero without backing from Panama City to declare their separation from the Spanish Empire. In both Veraguas and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans. </p>\n <p>Nevertheless, the Grito was an event that shook the isthmus to its very core. It was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in Panama City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from Spain, but also for their right to self-rule apart from Panama City once the Spaniards were gone. </p>\n <p>It was an incredibly brave move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel José Pedro Antonio de Fábrega y de las Cuevas (1774–1841), and with good reason. The Colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus’ military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists. </p>\n <p>What they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, Juan de la Cruz Murgeón, left the isthmus on a campaign in Quito and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting y Fábrega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, Fábrega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, Fábrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city’s support for independence. No military repercussions occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troops. </p>\n <h3> <span class=mw-headline id=Post-colonial_Panama>Post-colonial Panama</span><span class=mw-editsection><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>[</span>edit<span class=mw-editsection-bracket>]</span></span><br>\n </h3> <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:222px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Panama_canal_cartooon_1903.jpg/220px-Panama_canal_cartooon_1903.jpg\" width=220 height=118 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>1903 political cartoon.

The divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of North America, and only near the Colombian border are there highlands related to the Andean system of South America. The spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom, in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions. </p>\n <p>The mountain range of the divide is called the Cordillera de Talamanca near the Costa Rican border. Farther east it becomes the Serranía de Tabasará, and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus, where the Panama Canal is located, is often called the Sierra de Veraguas. As a whole, the range between Costa Rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographers as the Cordillera Central. </p>\n <p>The highest point in the country is the Volcán Barú, which rises to 3,475 metres (11,401 feet). A nearly impenetrable jungle forms the Darién Gap between Panama and Colombia where Colombian guerrillas and drug dealers operate and sometimes take hostages. This and unrest, and forest protection movements, create a break in the Pan-American Highway, which otherwise forms a complete road from Alaska to Patagonia. </p>\n <p>Panama’s wildlife is the most diverse in Central America.

Mostly unnavigable, many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the Río Chagres (<i>Chagres River</i>), located in central Panama, is one of the few wide rivers and a source of enormous hydroelectric power. The central part of the river is dammed by the Gatun Dam and forms Gatun Lake, an artificial lake that constitutes part of the Panama Canal. The lake was created by the construction of the Gatun Dam across the Río Chagres between 1907 and 1913. Once created, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world, and the dam was the largest earth dam. The river drains northwest into the Caribbean. The Kampia and Madden Lakes (also filled from the Río Chagres) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former Canal Zone. </p>\n <p>The Río Chepo, another source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific. These Pacific-oriented rivers are longer and slower-running than those on the Caribbean side. Their basins are also more extensive.

Temperatures are uniformly high—as is the relative humidity—and there is little seasonal variation. Diurnal ranges are low; on a typical dry-season day in the capital city, the early morning minimum may be 24 °C (75.2 °F) and the afternoon maximum 30 °C (86.0 °F). The temperature seldom exceeds 32 °C (89.6 °F) for more than a short time. Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean, and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country. Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges, and frosts occur in the Cordillera de Talamanca in western Panama. </p>\n <p>Climatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on rainfall, which varies regionally from less than 1,300 millimeters (51.2 in) to more than 3,000 millimeters (118.1 in) per year. Almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season, which is usually from April to December, but varies in length from seven to nine months. In general, rainfall is much heavier on the Caribbean than on the Pacific side of the continental divide. The annual average in Panama City is little more than half of that in Colón. Although rainy-season thunderstorms are common, the country is outside the hurricane belt. </p>\n <p>Panama’s tropical environment supports an abundance of plants. Forests dominate, interrupted in places by grasslands, scrub, and crops. Although nearly 40% of Panama is still wooded, deforestation is a continuing threat to the rain-drenched woodlands. Tree cover has been reduced by more than 50 percent since the 1940s. Subsistence farming, widely practised from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands, consists largely of corn, bean, and tuber plots. Mangrove swamps occur along parts of both coasts, with banana plantations occupying deltas near Costa Rica. In many places, a multi-canopied rain forest abuts the swamp on one side of the country and extends to the lower reaches of slopes on the other. </p>\n <h2> <span class=mw-headline id=Politics>Politics</span><span class=mw-editsection><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>[</span>edit<span class=mw-editsection-bracket>]</span></span><br>\n </h2> <div role=note class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: Politics of Panama </div>\n <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:222px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Asamblea_Nacional_de_Panam%C3%A1.JPG/220px-Asamblea_Nacional_de_Panam%C3%A1.JPG\" width=220 height=147 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>The National Assembly of Panama.</p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <p>Panama’s politics take place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Panama is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system.

</div>\n <p>During the 16th century, education in Panama was provided by Jesuits. Public education began as a national and governmental institution in 1903. The principle underlying the early education system was that children should receive different types of education in accordance with their social class and therefore the position they were expected to occupy in society. </p>\n <p>Public education began in Panama soon after it seceded from Colombia in 1903. The first efforts were guided by an extremely paternalistic view of the goals of education, as evidenced in comments made in a 1913 meeting of the First Panamanian Educational Assembly, “The cultural heritage given to the child should be determined by the social position he will or should occupy. For this reason education should be different in accordance with the social class to which the student should be related.” This elitist focus changed rapidly under US influence.<sup id=cite_ref-cs_77-0 class=reference>[77]</sup></p>\n <p>In 2010, it was estimated that 94.1 percent of the population was literate (94.7 percent of males and 93.5 percent of females).<sup id=cite_ref-cia.gov_72-1 class=reference>[72]</sup> Education in Panama is compulsory for the children between 6 and 18. In recent decades, school enrollment at all levels, but especially at upper levels, has increased significantly.

It is white, and is usually about 13 yards of material. </p>\n <p>The original <i>pollera</i> consists of a ruffled blouse worn off the shoulders and a skirt with gold buttons. The skirt is also ruffled, so that when it is lifted up, it looks like a peacock’s tail or a <i>mantilla</i> fan. The designs on the skirt and blouse are usually flowers or birds. Two large matching pom poms (<i>mota</i>) are on the front and back, four ribbons hang from the front and back from the waist, five gold chains (<i>caberstrillos</i>) hang from the neck to the waist, a gold cross or medallion on a black ribbon is worn as a choker, and a silk purse is worn at the waistline.

It is bordered on the northeast by Honduras, on the northwest by Guatemala, and on the south by the Pacific Ocean. El Salvador’s capital and largest city is San Salvador. As of 2016<sup class=\"plainlinks noexcerpt noprint asof-tag update\">[update]</sup>, the country had a population of approximately 6.34 million.<sup id=cite_ref-UN_WPP_3-1 class=reference>[3]</sup></p>\n <p>El Salvador was for centuries inhabited by several Mesoamerican nations, especially the Cuzcatlecs, as well as the Lenca and Maya. In the early 16th century, the Spanish Empire conquered the territory, incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New Spain ruled from Mexico City. However the Viceroyalty of Mexico had little or no influence in the daily affairs of the Central American isthmus, which would be colonized in 1524. In 1609 the area became the Captaincy General of Guatemala, from which El Salvador was part of until its independence from Spain, which took place in 1821, as part of the First Mexican Empire, then further seceded, as part of the Federal Republic of Central America, in 1823. When the Republic dissolved in 1841, El Salvador became a sovereign nation, then formed a short-lived union with Honduras and Nicaragua called the Greater Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1895 to 1898.<sup id=cite_ref-Boland2001_8-0 class=reference>[8]</sup><sup id=cite_ref-IhrieOropesa2011_9-0 class=reference>[9]</sup><sup id=cite_ref-Haskin2012_10-0 class=reference>[10]</sup></p>\n <p>From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, El Salvador endured chronic political and economic instability characterized by coups, revolts, and a succession of authoritarian rulers. Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest culminated in the devastating Salvadoran Civil War (1979–1992), which was fought between the military-led government and a coalition of left-wing guerrilla groups. The conflict ended with the Chapultepec Peace Accords. This negotiated settlement established a multiparty constitutional republic, which remains in place to this day. </p>\n <p>El Salvador’s economy has historically been dominated by agriculture, beginning with the indigo plant (<i>añil</i> in Spanish), the most important crop during the colonial period,<sup id=cite_ref-Montgomery1995_11-0 class=reference>[11]</sup><sup id=cite_ref-Murray1997_12-0 class=reference>[12]</sup> and followed thereafter by coffee, which by the early 20th century accounted for 90 percent of export earnings.<sup id=cite_ref-Boland2001b_13-0 class=reference>[13]</sup><sup id=cite_ref-Pearcy2006_14-0 class=reference>[14]</sup> El Salvador has since reduced its dependence on coffee and embarked on diversifying the economy by opening up trade and financial links and expanding the manufacturing sector.<sup id=cite_ref-FoleyHapipi2005_15-0 class=reference>[15]</sup> The colón, the official currency of El Salvador since 1892, was replaced by the U.S. dollar in 2001. </p>\n <p>As of 2010<sup class=\"plainlinks noexcerpt noprint asof-tag update\">[update]</sup>, El Salvador ranks 12th among Latin American countries in terms of the Human Development Index and fourth in Central America (behind Panama, Costa Rica, and Belize) due in part to ongoing rapid industrialisation.<sup id=cite_ref-16 class=reference>[16]</sup> However, the country continues to struggle with high rates of poverty, inequality, and crime. </p>\n <div id=toc class=toc> <div class=toctitle dir=ltr> <h2>Contents</h2> <p><span class=toctogglespan><label

The site has produced abundant Salvadoran megafauna fossils belonging to the Pleistocene epoch. The paleontological site was discovered accidentally in 2000, and in the following year, an excavation by the Museum of Natural History of El Salvador revealed not only several remnants of Cuvieronius, but also several other species of vertebrates. In the Tomayate site, they have recovered at least 19 species of vertebrates, including giant tortoises, Megatherium, Glyptodon, Toxodon, extinct horses, paleo-llamas and especially a large number of skeletal remains of proboscis genus Cuvieronius. The Tomayate site stands out from most Central American Pleistocene deposits, being more ancient and much richer, which provides valuable information of the Great American Interchange, in which the Central American isthmus landbridge played the title primordial role. At the same time, it is considered the richest vertebrate paleontological site in Central America and one of the largest accumulations of proboscideans in the Americas. </p>\n <h3><span class=mw-headline id=Pre-Columbian>Pre-Columbian</span></h3> <div role=note class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: Cuzcatlan </div>\n <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:222px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/ES_JoyadeCeren_06_2011_Estructura_9_Area_2_Tamazcal_2106.jpg/220px-ES_JoyadeCeren_06_2011_Estructura_9_Area_2_Tamazcal_2106.jpg\" width=220 height=147 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>Temazcal in Joya de Ceren.</p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <p>Sophisticated civilization in El Salvador dates to its settlement by the indigenous Lenca people; theirs was the first and the oldest indigenous civilization to settle in El Salvador.

The Maya arrived and settled in place of the Olmecs, but their numbers were greatly diminished when the Ilopango supervolcano eruption caused a massive Mayan exodus out of what is now El Salvador.<sup id=cite_ref-Campbell1985_18-0 class=reference>[18]</sup></p>\n <p>Centuries later they themselves were replaced by the Pipil people, Nahua speaking groups<sup id=cite_ref-Campbell1985_18-1 class=reference>[18]</sup> who migrated from Mexico in the centuries before the European conquest and occupied the central and western regions.

The Spaniards were disappointed to discover that the indigenous Pipil people had no gold or jewels like those they had found in Guatemala or Mexico, but recognized the richness of the land’s volcanic soil. </p>\n <p>Pedro de Alvarado led the first incursion by Spanish forces to extend their dominion to the nation of Cuzcatlan (El Salvador), in June 1524.<sup id=cite_ref-NicholsPool2012_30-0 class=reference>[30]</sup><br>\n When he arrived at the borders of the Cuzcatlan kingdom he saw that civilians had been evacuated. Cuzcatlec warriors moved to the coastal city of Acajutla and waited for Alvarado and his forces. Alvarado approached, confident that the result would be similar to what occurred in Mexico and Guatemala where the people believed the Spanish were gods. He thought he would easily defeat this new indigenous force since his Mexican allies and the Pipil of Cuzcatlan spoke a similar language. </p>\n <p>The Indigenous peoples of El Salvador did not see the Spanish as gods, but as foreign invaders. Alvarado saw that the Cuzcatan force outnumbered his Spanish soldiers and Mexican Indian allies. The Spanish withdrew and the Cuzcatlec army attacked, running behind them with war chants and shooting bow arrows. Alvarado had no choice but to fight to survive.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\">[<i><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2016)\">citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p>\n <p>Alvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail as having shields made of colorful exotic feathers, a vest-like armor made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and large spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\">[<i><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2016)\">citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p>\n <p>The Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to the Spanish king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, “If you want your weapons, come get them”. As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed. </p>\n <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:222px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Templo_tazumal.jpg/220px-Templo_tazumal.jpg\" width=220 height=165 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>Tazumal ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.</p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <p>The Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbors. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican Tlaxcala Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, Gonzalo de Alvarado, to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of smallpox. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatlán was completed and the city of San Salvador was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas. </p>\n <p>In 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of San Miguel, headed by another explorer and conquistador, Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.<sup id=cite_ref-31 class=reference>[31]</sup> The kingdom of Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso’s invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison. </p>\n <p>For ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of Intibucá. </p>\n <p>Antu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to Lempira (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537. </p>\n <h3> <span id=Spanish_rule_.281525.E2.80.931821.29></span><span class=mw-headline id=Spanish_rule_(1525–1821)>Spanish rule (1525–1821)</span><br>\n </h3> <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:222px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Proclama_de_libertad_%28indep._Centroam%C3%A9rica%29.jpg/220px-Proclama_de_libertad_%28indep._Centroam%C3%A9rica%29.jpg\" width=220 height=151 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>A painting of the First Independence Movement celebration in San Salvador.

The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an <i>intendancia</i> in 1786. </p>\n <p>Towards the end of 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country’s affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the French and American revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown’s military power as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively. </p>\n <p>In November 1811 Salvadoran priest José Matías Delgado rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the 1811 Independence Movement. This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, and again this insurrection was also suppressed. </p>\n <h3> <span id=Independence_.281821.29></span><span class=mw-headline id=Independence_(1821)>Independence (1821)</span><br>\n </h3> <p>In 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the Act of Independence of Central America, which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of Chiapas) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the Federal Republic of Central America. </p>\n <p>In early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted First Mexican Empire under Agustín de Iturbide. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to San Salvador and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.) </p>\n <p>When the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the Greater Republic of Central America, which dissolved in 1898. </p>\n <p>After the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that coffee yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an oligarchy of just a few families.<sup id=cite_ref-32 class=reference>[32]</sup></p>\n <p>Throughout the last half of the 19th century, a succession of presidents from the ranks of the Salvadoran oligarchy, nominally both conservative and liberal, generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the predominant cash crop, the development of infrastructure (railroads and port facilities) primarily in support of the coffee trade, the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production, the passage of anti-vagrancy laws to ensure that displaced campesinos and other rural residents provided sufficient labor for the coffee fincas (plantations), and the suppression of rural discontent. In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force. </p>\n <h3><span class=mw-headline id=20th_century>20th century</span></h3> <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:152px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Tom%C3%A1s_Regalado.jpg\" width=150 height=239 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>Gen.

After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador, and was killed July 11, 1906, at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President Dr. Manuel Enrique Araujo was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder. </p>\n <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:172px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Civil_Ensign_of_El_Salvador.svg/170px-Civil_Ensign_of_El_Salvador.svg.png\" width=170 height=99 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>Dios, Union, Libertad (God, Union, Liberty) El Salvador 1912 Flag.</p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <p>Araujo’s administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. Pio Romero Bosque, ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President Jorge Meléndez and in 1930 announced free elections, in which Arturo Araujo came to power on March 1, 1931 in what was considered the country’s first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was Gen. Maximiliano Hernández Martínez. </p>\n <p>In December 1931, a coup d’état organized by junior officers and led by Gen. Martínez started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces. </p>\n <p>The Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,<sup id=cite_ref-33 class=reference>[33]</sup> a rich anti-Communist banker called Rodolfo Duke, and later installed the ardent fascist Gen. Martínez as president. The revolt was probably due to the army’s discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt. </p>\n <p>The U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Martínez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944, but resigned in May after a general strike. Martínez had said he was going to respect the Constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise. </p>\n <p>From December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Martínez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising, originally led by Farabundo Martí and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as La Matanza (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of peasants died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez. </p>\n <p>In the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader Farabundo Martí helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of Marxist-Leninist ideology (strongly rejecting Stalinism). In December 1930, at the height of the country’s economic and social depression, Martí was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation’s poor and rumors of his upcoming nomination for President the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Martí returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military. </p>\n <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:172px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Jose_Napoleon_Duarte.png/170px-Jose_Napoleon_Duarte.png\" width=170 height=255 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>José Napoleón Duarte.</p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <p>They helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by killing over 30,000 people at what was to have been a “peaceful meeting” in 1932; this became known as La Matanza (The Slaughter). The peasant uprising against Martínez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Martínez, who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Martí shot after a perfunctory hearing. </p>\n <p>Historically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighboring Honduras, as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the 1969 Football War between the two countries.<sup id=cite_ref-34 class=reference>[34]</sup> As many as 130,000 Salvadorans were forcibly expelled or fled from Honduras.<sup id=cite_ref-35 class=reference>[35]</sup></p>\n <p>The Christian Democratic Party (PDC) and the National Conciliation Party (PCN) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election;<sup id=cite_ref-36 class=reference>[36]</sup> Both parties have since reconstituted. They share common ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military. </p>\n <p>PDC leader José Napoleón Duarte was the mayor of San Salvador from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the regime of PCN President Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo, who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly. Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the National Opposition Union (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col. Arturo Armando Molina, in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers’ request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer. </p>\n <h3> <span id=Salvadoran_Civil_War_.281979.E2.80.931992.29></span><span class=mw-headline id=Salvadoran_Civil_War_(1979–1992)>Salvadoran Civil War (1979–1992)</span><br>\n </h3> <div role=note class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Further information: Salvadoran Civil War </div>\n <p>In October 1979, a coup d’état brought the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador to power.

Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, or FMLN.

It stretches 270 km (168 mi) from west-northwest to east-southeast and 142 km (88 mi) north to south, with a total area of 21,041 km<sup>2</sup> (8,124 sq mi). As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called <i>Pulgarcito de America</i> (the “Tom Thumb of the Americas”). The highest point in El Salvador is Cerro El Pital, at 2,730 metres (8,957 ft), on the border with Honduras. </p>\n <p>El Salvador has a long history of destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes, two of them, San Miguel and Izalco, active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name “Lighthouse of the Pacific.” Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone. </p>\n <p>El Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador’s only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country’s area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the Goascorán, Jiboa, Torola, Paz and the Río Grande de San Miguel. </p>\n <p>There are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are Lake Ilopango (70 km2) and Lake Coatepeque (26 km2). Lake Güija is El Salvador’s largest natural lake (44 km2). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is Embalse Cerrón Grande (135 km2). There are a total 320 km<sup>2</sup> (123.6 sq mi) of water within El Salvador’s borders. </p>\n <p>El Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is 546 km (339 mi): 126 miles (203 km) with Guatemala and 343 km (213 mi) with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is 307 km (191 mi) long. </p>\n <p>Two parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central plateau, covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands. </p>\n <h3><span class=mw-headline id=Climate>Climate</span></h3> <div role=note class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: Climate of El Salvador </div>\n <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:222px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/El_Salvador_Topography.png/220px-El_Salvador_Topography.png\" width=220 height=201 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>El Salvador’s topography.</p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <p>El Salvador has a tropical climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as <i>invierno</i> or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170 mm. </p>\n <p>The best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. Hurricanes occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of Hurricane Mitch, which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America. </p>\n <p>From November through April, the northeast trade winds control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as <i>verano</i>, or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in Honduras. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures will be cool. In the extreme northeastern part of the country near Cerro El Pital, snow is known to fall during summer as well as during winter due to the high elevations (it is the coldest part of the country). </p>\n <h3><span class=mw-headline id=Natural_disasters>Natural disasters</span></h3> <h4><span class=mw-headline id=Extreme_weather_events>Extreme weather events</span></h4> <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:222px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Salcoatit%C3%A1n%2C_El_Salvador_-_panoramio_%289%29.jpg/220px-Salcoatit%C3%A1n%2C_El_Salvador_-_panoramio_%289%29.jpg\" width=220 height=165 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>Volcanic range, Cordillera de Apaneca, view from Salcoatitán </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <p>El Salvador’s position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe droughts, both of which may be made more extreme by the El Niño and La Niña effects.

The Accords also removed some security forces who were in command of the army, such as the National Guard, Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s. </p>\n <p>The political framework of El Salvador is a presidential representative democratic republic with a multiform, multi-party system. The President, currently Salvador Sánchez Cerén, is both head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government.

Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States, sent to family members in El Salvador, are a major source of foreign income and offset the substantial trade deficit of $4.12 billion. Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade, and reached an all-time high of $3.32 billion in 2006 (an increase of 17% over the previous year).<sup id=cite_ref-69 class=reference>[69]</sup> approximately 16.2% of gross domestic product(GDP). </p>\n <p>Remittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador. In 2005, the number of people living in extreme poverty in El Salvador was 20%,<sup id=cite_ref-70 class=reference>[70]</sup> according to a United Nations Development Program report. Without remittances, the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased. </p>\n <p>Money from remittances has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans, and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.<sup id=cite_ref-71 class=reference>[71]</sup></p>\n <h3><span class=mw-headline id=Free_trade_agreements>Free trade agreements</span></h3> <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:172px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Torre_futura.jpg/170px-Torre_futura.jpg\" width=170 height=227 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>Torre Futura at World Trade Center San Salvador </p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <p>In 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector’s competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives. </p>\n <p>There are a total of 15 free trade zones in El Salvador. El Salvador signed the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) — negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the Dominican Republic — with the United States in 2004. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster free trade. El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico, Chile, the Dominican Republic, and Panama and increased its trade with those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada. In October 2007, these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union.

According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, “While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behavior by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d’Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder Roberto d’Aubuisson, told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca ‘deliberately ignored’ his Public Works Minister’s government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests.”<sup id=cite_ref-72 class=reference>[72]</sup></p>\n <p>Subsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank’s annual “Ease of doing business” index.<sup id=cite_ref-73 class=reference>[73]</sup></p>\n <p>As per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, “Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most “business friendly” country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labor force and a strategic geographical position. The country’s membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI.”<sup id=cite_ref-74 class=reference>[74]</sup></p>\n <p>Foreign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy’s Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in. Four years later, Enel indicated it would seek arbitration against El Salvador, blaming the government for technical problems that prevent it from completing its investment.<sup id=cite_ref-75 class=reference>[75]</sup> The government came to its defense claiming that Art 109 of the constitution does not allow any government (regardless of the party they belong), to privatize the resources of the national soil (in this case geothermic energy). The dispute came to an end in December 2014 when both parties came to a settlement, from which no details have been released. The small country had yielded to pressure from the Washington based powerful ICSID.<sup id=cite_ref-76 class=reference>[76]</sup> The U.S. Embassy warned in 2009 that the Salvadoran government’s populist policies of mandating artificially low electricity prices were damaging private sector profitability, including the interests of American investors in the energy sector.<sup id=cite_ref-ID_No._09SANSALVADOR1184_77-0 class=reference>[77]</sup> The U.S. Embassy noted the corruption of El Salvador’s judicial system and quietly urged American businesses to include “arbitration clauses, preferably with a foreign venue,” when doing business in the country.<sup id=cite_ref-ID_No._09SANSALVADOR47_78-0 class=reference>[78]</sup></p>\n <p>The U.S. Embassy warned in 2009 that the Salvadoran government’s populist policies of mandating artificially low electricity prices were damaging private sector profitability, including the interests of American investors in the energy sector.<sup id=cite_ref-ID_No._09SANSALVADOR1184_77-1 class=reference>[77]</sup> The U.S. Embassy noted the corruption of El Salvador’s judicial system and quietly urged American businesses to include “arbitration clauses, preferably with a foreign venue,” when doing business in the country.<sup id=cite_ref-ID_No._09SANSALVADOR47_78-1 class=reference>[78]</sup><br>\n On the other hand, a 2008 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [2] indicates that one third of the generation of electricity in El Salvador was publicly owned while two thirds was in American hands and other foreign ownership.

Sometimes the filling is <i>queso con loroco</i> (cheese combined with <i>loroco</i>, a vine flower bud native to Central America).<sup id=cite_ref-Elsalvador.com_117-0 class=reference>[117]</sup></p>\n <p><i>Pupusas revueltas</i> are <i>pupusas</i> filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer <i>pupusas</i> stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name <i>pupusa</i> comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, <i>pupushahua</i>. The precise origins of the <i>pupusa</i> are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.<sup id=cite_ref-Elsalvador.com_117-1 class=reference>[117]</sup></p>\n <p>Two other typical Salvadoran dishes are <i>yuca frita</i> and <i>panes con pollo</i>. <i>Yuca frita</i> is deep fried cassava root served with curtido (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with <i>pescaditas</i> (fried baby sardines). The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. <i>Pan con pollo/pavo</i> (bread with chicken/turkey) are warm turkey or chicken-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with Pipil spices and handpulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with tomato and watercress along with cucumber, onion, lettuce, mayonnaise, and mustard. </p>\n <p>One of El Salvador’s typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States. </p>\n <p>Alguashte, a condiment made from dried, ground pepitas, is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes. </p>\n <p>“<i>Maria Luisa</i>” is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar. </p>\n <p>A popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is <i>Horchata</i>, a drink native to the Valencian Community in Spain. <i>Horchata</i> is most commonly made of the morro seed ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. <i>Horchata</i> is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of <i>pupusas</i> or fried yuca. <i>Horchata</i> from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican <i>horchata</i>, which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.<sup id=cite_ref-118 class=reference>[118]</sup></p>\n <p>Other popular drinks in El Salvador include <i>Ensalada</i>, a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and <i>Kolachampan</i>, a sugar cane-flavored carbonated beverage. </p>\n <p>One of the most popular desserts is the cake <i>Pastel de tres leches</i> (Cake of three milks), consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream. </p>\n <h3><span class=mw-headline id=Music>Music</span></h3> <div role=note class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: Music of El Salvador </div>\n <p>Salvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous Lenca, Maya, Cacaopera, Pipil and Spanish influences. Music includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate Christmas and other holidays, especially feast days of the saints). Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. Cuban, Colombian, and Mexican music has infiltrated the country, especially <i>salsa</i> and <i>cumbia</i>. Popular music in El Salvador uses <i>marimba</i>, <i>tehpe’ch</i>, flutes, drums, scrapers and gourds, as well as more recently imported guitars and other instruments. El Salvador’s well known folk dance is known as <i>Xuc</i> which originated in Cojutepeque, Cuscatlan. Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and canciones. </p>\n <h3><span class=mw-headline id=Sport>Sport</span></h3> <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:222px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Estadio_cuscatlan.jpg/220px-Estadio_cuscatlan.jpg\" width=220 height=165 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>The Estadio Cuscatlán in San Salvador is the largest stadium in Central America</p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <div role=note class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: Sport in El Salvador </div>\n <p>Football is the most popular sport in El Salvador.

country in the West Indies in the Americas, lying between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. It consists of two major islands, Antigua and Barbuda, and a number of smaller islands (including Great Bird, Green, Guiana, Long, Maiden and York Islands and further south, the island of Redonda). The permanent population numbers about 81,800 (at the 2011 Census) and the capital and largest port and city is St. John’s on Antigua. Lying near each other (the main Barbuda airport is less than 0.5° of latitude, or 30 nautical miles, north of the main Antigua airport), Antigua and Barbuda are in the middle of the Leeward Islands, part of the Lesser Antilles, roughly at 17°N of the equator. </p>\n <p>The island of Antigua was explored by Christopher Columbus in 1493 and named for the Church of Santa María La Antigua.<sup id=cite_ref-5 class=reference>[5]</sup> Antigua was colonized by Britain in 1632; Barbuda island was first colonized in 1678.<sup id=cite_ref-6 class=reference>[6]</sup> Antigua and Barbuda joined the West Indies Federation in 1958.<sup id=cite_ref-7 class=reference>[7]</sup> With the breakup of the federation, it became one of the West Indies Associated States in 1967.<sup

They were succeeded by the ceramic age pre-Columbian Arawak-speaking Saladoid people who migrated from the lower Orinoco River. </p>\n <p>The Arawaks introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous Antigua black pineapple (Moris cultivar of <i>Ananas comosus</i>), corn, sweet potatoes, chiles, guava, tobacco, and cotton. </p>\n <p>The indigenous West Indians made excellent seagoing vessels which they used to sail around on the Atlantic and the Caribbean. As a result, Caribs and Arawaks were able to colonize much of South America and the Caribbean Islands. Their descendants still live there, notably in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. </p>\n <p>Most Arawaks left Antigua around 1100 AD; those who remained were later raided by the Caribs. According to the <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i>, the Caribs’ superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most of the West Indian Arawak nations, enslaving some and possibly cannibalising others. </p>\n <div class=\"thumb tleft\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:222px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/The_Mill_Yard_-_Ten_Views_in_the_Island_of_Antigua_%281823%29%2C_plate_V_-_BL.jpg/220px-The_Mill_Yard_-_Ten_Views_in_the_Island_of_Antigua_%281823%29%2C_plate_V_-_BL.jpg\" width=220 height=153 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>Antigua in 1823</p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <p>The <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i> makes it clear that the European invaders had difficulty differentiating between the various groups of the native peoples they encountered. As a result, the number and types of ethnic/tribal groups in existence at that time may have been much more varied and numerous than just the two mentioned in this article. </p>\n <p>European and African diseases, malnutrition, and slavery eventually killed most of the Caribbean’s native population. Smallpox was probably the greatest killer.<sup id=cite_ref-11 class=reference>[11]</sup> Some historians<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template\">[<i><span title=\"The material near this tag possibly uses too-vague attribution or weasel words.

Others believe the reportedly abundant but starchy, low-protein diet may have contributed to their severe malnutrition as they were used to a diet fortified with protein from the sea.<sup id=cite_ref-Rogozinski_12-0 class=reference>[12]</sup></p>\n <p>The Spaniards did not colonise Antigua because it lacked fresh water but not aggressive Caribs. The English settled on Antigua in 1632; Christopher Codrington settled on Barbuda in 1684. Slavery, established to run sugar plantations around 1684, was abolished in 1834. The British ruled from 1632 to 1981, with a brief French interlude in 1666. </p>\n <p>The islands became an independent state within the Commonwealth of Nations on 1 November 1981, with Elizabeth II as the first Queen of Antigua and Barbuda. Vere Cornwall Bird Sr became the first Prime Minister. </p>\n <p>Most of Barbuda was devastated in early September 2017 by Hurricane Irma, which brought winds with speeds reaching 295 km/h (185 mph). The storm damaged or destroyed 95% of the island’s buildings and infrastructure, leaving Barbuda “barely habitable” according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne. Nearly everyone on the island was evacuated to Antigua.<sup id=cite_ref-auto_13-0 class=reference>[13]</sup></p>\n <h2> <span class=mw-headline id=Geography>Geography</span><span class=mw-editsection><span class=mw-editsection-bracket>[</span>edit<span class=mw-editsection-bracket>]</span></span><br>\n </h2> <div role=note class=\"hatnote navigation-not-searchable\">Main article: Geography of Antigua and Barbuda </div>\n <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:302px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Ac-map.png/300px-Ac-map.png\" width=300 height=323 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>A map of Antigua and Barbuda</p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <div class=\"thumb tright\"> <div class=thumbinner style=width:222px> <img alt src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Antigue_34622.jpg/220px-Antigue_34622.jpg\" width=220 height=124 class=thumbimage> <div class=thumbcaption> <div class=magnify></div>\n <p>English Harbour, Antigua</p>\n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n <p>Antigua and Barbuda both are generally low-lying islands whose terrain has been influenced more by limestone formations than volcanic activity.

America</b> (<b>USA</b>), commonly known as the <b>United States</b> (<b>U.S.</b>) or <b>America</b>, is a federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions.<sup id=cite_ref-20 class=reference>[fn 6]</sup> At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2</sup>), the United States is the world’s third- or fourth-largest country by total area<sup id=cite_ref-largestcountry_25-0 class=reference>[fn 7]</sup> and just fractionally smaller than the entire continent of Europe’s 3.9 million square miles. With a population of over 325 million people, the U.S. is the third-most populous country. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the largest city by population is New York City. Forty-eight states and the capital’s federal district are contiguous in North America between Canada and Mexico. The State of Alaska is in the northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia to the west. The State of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine official time zones. The extremely diverse geography, climate, and wildlife of the United States make it one of the world’s 17 megadiverse countries.<sup id=cite_ref-urlMegadiverse_Countries_definition_|_Biodiversity_A-Z_26-0 class=reference>[19]</sup></p>\n <p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago.<sup id=cite_ref-FOOTNOTEErlandsonRickVellanoweth200819_27-0 class=reference>[20]</sup>European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies following the French and Indian War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775, and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power.<sup id=cite_ref-28 class=reference>[21]</sup> The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories,<sup id=cite_ref-MD2007_29-0 class=reference>[22]</sup>displacing Native American tribes, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848.<sup id=cite_ref-MD2007_29-1 class=reference>[22]</sup> During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery.<sup id=cite_ref-30 class=reference>[23]</sup><sup id=cite_ref-31 class=reference>[24]</sup> By the end of the century, the United States had extended into the Pacific Ocean,<sup id=cite_ref-AmCentNYT_32-0 class=reference>[25]</sup> and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.<sup id=cite_ref-33 class=reference>[26]</sup> The Spanish–American War and <span class=nowrap>World War I</span> confirmed the country’s status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span class=nowrap>World War II</span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine<sup id=cite_ref-Saint_Augustine_77-1 class=reference>[70]</sup> and Santa Fe. The French established their own as well along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims’ Plymouth Colony in 1620. Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent’s first elected legislative assembly, Virginia’s House of Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.<sup id=cite_ref-Remini2–3_78-0 class=reference>[71]</sup><sup id=cite_ref-Johnson26–30_79-0 class=reference>[72]</sup></p>\n <p>Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements.

Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.<sup id=cite_ref-92 class=reference>[85]</sup> The colonies’ distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.<sup id=cite_ref-93 class=reference>[86]</sup></p>\n <p>In 1774, the Spanish Navy ship <i>Santiago</i>, under Juan Pérez, entered and anchored in an inlet of Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, in present-day British Columbia. Although the Spanish did not land, natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from California.<sup id=cite_ref-94 class=reference>[87]</sup> At the time, the Spanish were able to monopolize the trade between Asia and North America, granting limited licenses to the Portuguese.

Bad weather forced his ships south to about 43° north before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward.<sup id=cite_ref-98 class=reference>[90]</sup> In March 1778, Cook landed on Bligh Island and named the inlet “King George’s Sound”.
