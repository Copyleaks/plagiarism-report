States (U.S.) or America (/əˈmɛrɪkə/), is a federal republic[14][15] composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions.[fn 6] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2)[17] and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world’s third- or fourth-largest country by total area[fn 7] and the third-most populous. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the largest city by population is New York City. Forty-eight states and the capital’s federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia to the west. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine official time zones. The extremely diverse geography, climate, and wildlife of the United States make it one of the world’s 17 megadiverse countries.[22]\n United States of America\n Flag of the United States\n Flag\n Great Seal of the United States\n Great Seal\n Motto:\n “In God We Trust”[1][fn 1]\n Other traditional mottos\n “E pluribus unum” (Latin) (de facto)\n “Out of many, one”\n “Annuit cœptis” (Latin)\n “He has favored our undertakings”\n “Novus ordo seclorum” (Latin)\n “New order of the ages”\n Anthem: “The Star-Spangled Banner”\n  \n March: “The Stars and Stripes Forever”[2][3]\n  \n Projection of North America with the United States in green\n The contiguous United States plus Alaska and Hawaii\n The United States and its territories\n The United States including its territories\n Capital Washington, D.C.\n 38°53′N 77°01′W\n Largest city New York City\n 40°43′N 74°00′W\n Official languages None at federal level[fn 2]\n National language English[fn 3]\n Ethnic groups (2016[6]) By race:\n 77.1% White\n 13.3% Black\n 5.6% Asian\n 2.6% Other/multiracial\n 1.2% Native\n 0.2% Pacific Islander\n Ethnicity:\n 17.6% Hispanic or Latino\n 82.4% non-Hispanic or Latino\n Religion (2015[7]) 70.6% Christian\n 22.8% Unaffiliated\n 1.9% Jewish\n 0.9% Muslim\n 0.7% Buddhist\n 0.7% Hindu\n 1.8% Other faiths\n Demonym American\n Government Federal presidential constitutional republic\n • President\n Donald Trump\n • Vice President\n Mike Pence\n • Speaker of the House\n Paul Ryan\n • Chief Justice\n John Roberts\n Legislature Congress\n • Upper house\n Senate\n • Lower house\n House of Representatives\n Independence from Great Britain\n • Declaration\n July 4, 1776\n • Confederation\n March 1, 1781\n • Treaty of Paris\n September 3, 1783\n • Constitution\n June 21, 1788\n • Last polity admitted\n March 24, 1976\n Area\n • Total area\n 3,796,742 sq mi (9,833,520 km2) (3rd/4th)\n • Water (%)\n 6.97\n • Total land area\n 3,531,905 sq mi (9,147,590 km2)\n Population\n • 2017 estimate\n 325,365,189[8] (3rd)\n • 2010 census\n 308,745,538[9] (3rd)\n • Density\n 90.6/sq mi (35.0/km2) (180th)\n GDP (PPP) 2016 estimate\n • Total\n $18.558 trillion[10] (2nd)\n • Per capita\n $57,220[10] (14th)\n GDP (nominal) 2016 estimate\n • Total\n $18.558 trillion[10] (1st)\n • Per capita\n $57,467[11] (7th)\n Gini (2013) Negative increase 41.1[12]\n medium\n HDI (2015) Increase 0.920[13]\n very high · 10th\n Currency United States dollar ($) (USD)\n Time zone (UTC−4 to −12, +10, +11)\n • Summer (DST)\n (UTC−4 to −10[fn 4])\n Date format mm/dd/yyyy (AD)\n Drives on the right[fn 5]\n Calling code +1\n ISO 3166 code US\n Internet TLD .us\n Website\n usa.gov\n \n Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago.[23] European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies following the French and Indian War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775, and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power.[24] The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories,[25] displacing Native American tribes, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848.[25] During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the outlawing of slavery.[26][27] By the end of the century, the United States had extended into the Pacific Ocean,[28] and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.[29] The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country’s status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the 1969 moon landing. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world’s sole superpower.[30]\n The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world’s largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP.[31] The U.S. economy is the fastest-growing in the Americas[32][33] and is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world.[34] Though its population is only 4.3% of the world total,[8] Americans hold 33.2% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country.[35] The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage,[36] human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person.[37] The U.S. is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending.[38] It is also a global leader in science and technology.\n Contents\n Etymology\n See also: Naming of America, Names for United States citizens, and American (word)\n The Americas are named after Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci.[39]\n In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere the Americas in honor of the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin: Americus Vespucius).[40] The first documentary evidence of the phrase “United States of America” is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., George Washington’s aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army. Addressed to Lt. Col. Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed his wish to carry the “full and ample powers of the United States of America” to Spain to assist in the revolutionary war effort.[41][42][43] The first known publication of the phrase “United States of America” was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[44]\n The second draft of the Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared “The name of this Confederation shall be the ‘United States of America'”.[45] The final version of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence “The Stile of this Confederacy shall be ‘The United States of America'”.[46] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA” in all capitalized letters in the headline of his “original Rough draught” of the Declaration of Independence.[45] This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.[45]\n The short form “United States” is also standard. Other common forms are the “U.S.”, the “USA”, and “America”. Colloquial names are the “U.S. of A.” and, internationally, the “States”. “Columbia”, a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the name “District of Columbia”.[47]\n The phrase “United States” was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states–e.g., “the United States are”–including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865.[48] The singular form–e.g., “the United States is”–became popular after the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom “these United States”. The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.[49]\n A citizen of the United States is an “American”. “United States”, “American” and “U.S.” refer to the country adjectivally (“American values”, “U.S. forces”). In English, the word “American” rarely refers to topics or subjects not connected with the United States.[50]\n History\n Main articles: History of the United States, Timeline of United States history, American business history, Economic history of the United States, and Labor history of the United States\n Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history\n Further information: Pre-Columbian era and Colonial history of the United States\n Artist’s re-creation of the Kincaid Site from the prehistoric Mississippian culture, as it may have looked[51]\n The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[52] After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward, either along the Pacific coast[53][54] or through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets.[55] The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and it is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas.[56] While the Clovis culture was thought, throughout the late 20th century, to represent the first human settlement of the Americas,[57] in recent years consensus has changed in recognition of pre-Clovis cultures.[58]\n Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies.[59] From approximately 800 to 1600 AD[60] the Mississippian culture flourished, and its largest city Cahokia is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States.[61] In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point between the twelfth[62] and fifteenth centuries,[63] lasting until the end of the Revolutionary War.[64]\n The date of the first settlements of the Hawaiian Islands is a topic of continuing debate.[65] Archaeological evidence seems to indicate a settlement as early as 124 AD.[66] During his third and final voyage, Captain James Cook became the first European to begin formal contact with Hawaii.[67] After his initial landfall in January 1778 at Waimea harbour, Kauai, Cook named the archipelago the “Sandwich Islands” after the fourth Earl of Sandwich–the acting First Lord of the Admiralty of the British Royal Navy.[68]\n European settlements\n Further information: European colonization of the Americas and Thirteen Colonies\n Saint Augustine, Florida, the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States (1565)[69]\n The Mayflower Compact, 1620 by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris\n After Spain sent Columbus on his first voyage to the New World in 1492, other explorers followed. The first Europeans to arrive in territory of the modern United States were Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made his first visit to Florida in 1513; however, if unincorporated territories are accounted for, then credit would go to Christopher Columbus who landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage. Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine[69] and Santa Fe. The French established their own as well along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims’ Plymouth Colony in 1620. Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent’s first elected legislative assembly, Virginia’s House of Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[70][71]\n Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world’s iron supply.[72] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.[73]\n A large-scale slave trade with English privateers was begun.[74] The life expectancy of slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves.[75][76] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.[77][78] But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.[79]\n With the British colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America were established.[80] All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism.[81] With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.[82] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.[83]\n During the Seven Years’ War (in America, known as the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[84] The colonies’ distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.[85]\n In 1774 the Spanish Navy ship Santiago, under Juan Pérez had entered and anchored in the inlet at Nootka Sound. Although the Spanish did not land, natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from California.[86] At the time, the Spanish were able to monopolize the trade between Asia and North America, granting limited licenses to the Portuguese. When the Russians began establishing a growing fur trading system in Alaska the Spanish began to challenge the Russians, with Pérez’s voyage being the first of many to the Pacific Northwest.[87][fn 8]\n After having arrived in the Hawaiian islands in 1778, Captain Cook sailed north and then north-east to explore the west coast of North America north of the Spanish settlements in Alta California. He made landfall on the Oregon coast at approximately 44°30′ north latitude, naming his landing point Cape Foulweather. Bad weather forced his ships south to about 43° north before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward.[89] In March 1778, Cook landed on Bligh Island and named the inlet “King George’s Sound”. He recorded that the native name was Nutka or Nootka, apparently misunderstanding his conversations at Friendly Cove/Yuquot; his informant may have been explaining that he was on an island (itchme nutka, a place you can “go around”). There may also have been confusion with Nuu-chah-nulth, the natives’ autonym (name for themselves). It may also have simply been based on Cook’s mispronunciation of Yuquot, the native name of the place.[90]\n Effects on and interaction with native populations\n Further information: American Indian Wars, Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas, and James Cook\n With the progress of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced.[91] The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles. Violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline among Native Americans, though conflict among themselves and with Europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial settlements.[92][93][94][95][96][97]\n In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.[98] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to “civilize” the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.[99][100]\n  \n Death of Captain Cook by Johann Zoffany (1795)\n Captain James Cook’s last voyage included sailing along the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. He returned to the Hawaii to resupply, initially exploring the coasts of Maui and the big island, trading with locals and then making anchor at Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. When his ships and company left the islands, a ship’s mast broke in bad weather, forcing them to return in mid-February. Cook would be killed days later.[101] [fn 9][fn 10]\n Independence and expansion (1776–1865)\n Further information: American Revolutionary War, United States Declaration of Independence, American Revolution, and Territorial evolution of the United States\n Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull\n The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of “republicanism” asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen and “no taxation without representation”. The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.[114]\n Following the passage of the Lee Resolution, on July 2, 1776, which was the actual vote for independence, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, which proclaimed, in a long preamble, that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great Britain, and declared, in the words of the resolution, that the Thirteen Colonies were independent states and had no allegiance to the British crown in the United States. The fourth day of July is celebrated annually as Independence Day.[115] The Second Continental Congress declared on September 9 “where, heretofore, the words ‘United Colonies’ have been used, the stile be altered for the future to the ‘United States’ “.[116] In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789.[115]\n Britain recognized the independence of the United States following their defeat at Yorktown in 1781.[117] In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[118]\n Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population.[119][120][121] The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[122] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[123]\n Americans’ eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars.[124] The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation’s area.[125] The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism.[126] A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[127] Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America’s large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&amp;M; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation’s land.[128]\n From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider white male suffrage; it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny.[129] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[130] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[131]\n The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration and the creation of additional western states.[132] After the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[133] Over a half-century, the loss of the American bison (sometimes called “buffalo”) was an existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures.[134] In 1869, a new Peace Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship, although conflicts, including several of the largest Indian Wars, continued throughout the West into the 1900s.[135]\n  \n The Statue of Liberty in New York City, dedicated in 1886, is a symbol of the United States as well as its ideals of freedom, democracy and opportunity.[136]\n Civil War and Reconstruction Era\n Further information: American Civil War and Reconstruction Era\n The Battle of Gettysburg by Thure de Thulstrup\n Differences of opinion over social order between northern and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans, ultimately led to the American Civil War.[137] Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.[138]\n With the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America, while the federal government maintained that secession was illegal.[138] The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863 as casualties mounted and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, a second war aim became abolition of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.[139]\n Following the Union victory in 1865, three amendments were added to the U.S. Constitution: the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited slavery, the Fourteenth Amendment provided citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,[140] and the Fifteenth Amendment ensured that they had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power[141] aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves.\n Southern white conservatives, calling themselves “Redeemers” took control after the end of Reconstruction. By the 1890–1910 period Jim Crow laws disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites. Blacks faced racial segregation, especially in the South.[142] Racial minorities occasionally experienced vigilante violence.[143]\n Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization\n Main articles: Economic history of the United States and Technological and industrial history of the United States\n Ellis Island, in New York City, was a major gateway for European immigration[144]\n In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country’s industrialization and transformed its culture.[145] National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.[146]\n  \n United States and its territories at their greatest extent from 1898 to 1902\n The end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets.[147] Mainland expansion was completed by the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[148] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War.[149]\n Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation’s progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The American economy boomed, becoming the world’s largest, and the United States achieved great power status.[150] These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[151] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women’s suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.[152][153][154]\n World War I, Great Depression, and World War II\n Further information: World War I, Great Depression, and World War II\n Crowd gathering on Wall Street after the 1929 crash\n The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I, in 1914, until 1917 when it joined the war as an “associated power”, alongside the formal Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this, and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[155]\n In 1920, the women’s rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women’s suffrage.[156] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television.[157] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system.[158] The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s;[159] whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[160]\n At first effectively neutral during World War II while Germany conquered much of continental Europe, the United States began supplying material to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers.[161] During the war, the United States was referred as one of the “Four Policemen”[162] of Allies power who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union and China.[163][164] Though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,[165] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[166]\n The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences with the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and other Allies, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe’s postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[167] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; causing the Japanese to surrender on September 2, ending World War II.[168][169] Parades and celebrations followed in what is known as Victory Day, or V-J Day.[170]\n Cold War and civil rights era\n Main articles: History of the United States (1945–64), History of the United States (1964–80), and History of the United States (1980–91)\n Further information: Cold War, Civil Rights Movement, War on Poverty, Space Race, and Reaganomics\n U.S. President Ronald Reagan at his “Tear down this wall!” speech in Berlin, Germany on June 12, 1987.[171]\n After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what became known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism[172] and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.\n The United States often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored. American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–53.[173] The Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a “Space Race” in which the United States became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969.[173] A proxy war in Southeast Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War.\n At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation’s infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[174][175] In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state added to the country.[176] The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination.[177][178][179] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution.\n The launch of a “War on Poverty” expanded entitlements and welfare spending, including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that provide health coverage to the elderly and poor, respectively, and the means-tested Food Stamp Program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.[180]\n The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned “containment” and initiated the more aggressive “rollback” strategy towards the USSR.[181][182][183][184][185] After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[186]\n The late 1980s brought a “thaw” in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.[187][188][189][190] This brought about unipolarity[191] with the U.S. unchallenged as the world’s dominant superpower. The concept of Pax Americana, which had appeared in the post-World War II period, gained wide popularity as a term for the post-Cold War new world order.\n Contemporary history\n Main articles: History of the United States (1991–2008) and History of the United States (2008–present)\n Further information: Gulf War, September 11 attacks, War on Terror, 2008 financial crisis, and Affordable Care Act\n The World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan during the September 11 attacks in 2001\n One World Trade Center, newly-built in its place\n After the Cold War, the conflict in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Sadaam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.[192]\n Originating in U.S. defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic networks, and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the global economy, society, and culture.[193]\n Due to the dot-com boom, stable monetary policy under Alan Greenspan, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.[194] Beginning in 1994, the U.S. entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade among the three partners has soared since NAFTA went into force.[195]\n On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[196] In response, the United States launched the War on Terror, which included war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.[197][198] In 2007, the Bush administration ordered a major troop surge in the Iraq War,[199] which successfully reduced violence and led to greater stability in the region.[200][201]\n Government policy designed to promote affordable housing,[202] widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance,[203] and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve[204] led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation’s history since the Great Depression.[205] Barack Obama, the first African American[206] and multiracial[207] president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis,[208] and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements[209] and a relative decline in unemployment.[210] Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection,[211] although there is evidence it may have had a negative impact on small banks.[212]\n In 2010, the Obama administration passed the Affordable Care Act, which made the most sweeping reforms to the nation’s healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused a significant reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016,[213] but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance.[214] Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama’s policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.[215]\n American forces in Iraq were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and the war in the region was declared formally over in December 2011.[216] The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency,[217] leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region.[218] In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time since 1961.[needs update][219] The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran’s nuclear program.[220]\n Geography, climate, and environment\n Main articles: Geography of the United States, Climate of the United States, and Environment of the United States\n A composite satellite image of the contiguous United States and surrounding areas\n Köppen climate classifications\n The land area of the contiguous United States is 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940.6 km2). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856.2 km2). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. The populated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2).[221] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.[222]\n The United States is the world’s third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted and how the total size of the United States is measured: calculations range from 3,676,486 square miles (9,522,055.0 km2)[223] to 3,717,813 square miles (9,629,091.5 km2)[224] to 3,796,742 square miles (9,833,516.6 km2).[225]\n The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont.[226] The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[227] The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world’s fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[227]\n The Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[228] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave.[229] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[230] and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[231] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska’s Denali (Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and North America.[232] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska’s Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent’s largest volcanic feature.[233] The United States has the most ecoregions out of any country in the world.[234]\n The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[235] The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[236] Extreme weather is not uncommon–the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world’s tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[237]\n Wildlife\n Main articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States\n See also: Category:Biota of the United States\n The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782.[238]\n The U.S. ecology is megadiverse: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[239] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species.[240] About 91,000 insect species have been described.[241] The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself.[242]\n There are 59 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[243] Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country’s land area.[244] Most of this is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; about .86% is used for military purposes.[245][246]\n Environmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation,[247][248] and international responses to global warming.[249][250] Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[251] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[252] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.[253]\n Demographics\n Main articles: Demography of the United States, Americans, List of U.S. states by population density, and List of United States cities by population\n Population\n Census Pop. %±\n 1790 3,929,214 —\n 1800 5,308,483 35.1%\n 1810 7,239,881 36.4%\n 1820 9,638,453 33.1%\n 1830 12,866,020 33.5%\n 1840 17,069,453 32.7%\n 1850 23,191,876 35.9%\n 1860 31,443,321 35.6%\n 1870 38,558,371 22.6%\n 1880 50,189,209 30.2%\n 1890 62,979,766 25.5%\n 1900 76,212,168 21.0%\n 1910 92,228,496 21.0%\n 1920 106,021,537 15.0%\n 1930 123,202,624 16.2%\n 1940 132,164,569 7.3%\n 1950 151,325,798 14.5%\n 1960 179,323,175 18.5%\n 1970 203,211,926 13.3%\n 1980 226,545,805 11.5%\n 1990 248,709,873 9.8%\n 2000 281,421,906 13.2%\n 2010 308,745,538 9.7%\n Est. 2016[254] 323,127,513 4.7%\n 1610–1780 population data.[255]\n Note that the census numbers do\n not include Native Americans until 1860.[256]\n The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the country’s population to be 323,425,550 as of April 25, 2016, and to be adding 1 person (net gain) every 13 seconds, or about 6,646 people per day.[8] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from about 76 million in 1900.[257] The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected.[258] In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children, by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56.[259] Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.86 children per woman in 2014. Foreign born immigration has caused the US population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 40 million in 2010, representing one third of the population increase.[260] The foreign born population reached 45 million in 2015.[261][fn 11]\n The United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world average.[265] Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher than that of many developed nations.[266] In fiscal year 2015, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.[267] Mexico has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every year since the 1990s.[268] As of 2012, approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal immigrants.[269] As of 2015, 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing.[261]\n Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 37.2% of the population in 2012[270] and over 50% of children under age one,[271][272] and are projected to constitute the majority by 2044.[271]\n According to a survey conducted by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.[273][274] A 2016 Gallup poll also concluded that 4.1% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%.[275] In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.[276]\n In 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively).[277] The census counted more than 19 million people of “Some Other Race” who were “unable to identify with any” of its five official race categories in 2010, over 18.5 million (97%) of whom are of Hispanic ethnicity.[277]\n The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend. The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent[277] are identified as sharing a distinct “ethnicity” by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent.[278] Between 2000 and 2010, the country’s Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%.[279] Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[280][fn 12]\n About 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs);[225] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[286] The US has numerous clusters of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston).[287] There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million.[288] Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South.[289] The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008.[288]\n  \n Leading population centers (see complete list) view talk edit\n Rank Core city (cities) Metro area population Metropolitan Statistical Area Region[290]\n New York City\n New York City\n Los Angeles\n Los Angeles\n Chicago\n Chicago\n Dallas\n Dallas\n 1 New York 20,153,634 New York–Newark–Jersey City, NY–NJ–PA MSA Northeast\n 2 Los Angeles 13,310,447 Los Angeles–Long Beach–Anaheim, CA MSA West\n 3 Chicago 9,512,999 Chicago–Joliet–Naperville, IL–IN–WI MSA Midwest\n 4 Dallas–Fort Worth 7,233,323 Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington, TX MSA South\n 5 Houston 6,656,947 Houston–The Woodlands-Sugar Land MSA South\n 6 Washington, D.C. 6,772,470 Washington, DC–VA–MD–WV MSA South\n 7 Philadelphia 6,070,500 Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington, PA–NJ–DE–MD MSA Northeast\n 8 Miami 6,066,387 Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach, FL MSA South\n 9 Atlanta 5,789,700 Atlanta–Sandy Springs–Roswell, GA MSA South\n 10 Boston 4,794,447 Boston–Cambridge–Quincy, MA–NH MSA Northeast\n 11 San Francisco 4,679,166 San Francisco–Oakland–Fremont, CA MSA West\n 12 Phoenix 4,661,537 Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, AZ MSA West\n 13 Riverside–San Bernardino 4,527,837 Riverside–San Bernardino–Ontario, CA MSA West\n 14 Detroit 4,297,617 Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI MSA Midwest\n 15 Seattle 3,798,902 Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue, WA MSA West\n 16 Minneapolis–St. Paul 3,551,036 Minneapolis–St. Paul–Bloomington, MN–WI MSA Midwest\n 17 San Diego 3,317,749 San Diego–Carlsbad–San Marcos, CA MSA West\n 18 Tampa–St. Petersburg 3,032,171 Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater, FL MSA South\n 19 Denver 2,853,077 Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO MSA West\n 20 St. Louis 2,807,002 St. Louis MO–IL MSA Midwest\n Based on 2015 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[291]\n Language\n Main article: Languages of the United States\n See also: Language Spoken at Home in the United States of America, List of endangered languages in the United States, and Language education in the United States\n English (American English) is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws–such as U.S. naturalization requirements–standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.[292][293] Some Americans advocate making English the country’s official language, as it is in 32 states.[294]\n Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state law.[295] Alaska recognizes twenty Native languages as well as English.[296] While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[297] Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms.[298]\n Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan[299] and Chamorro[300] are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands;[301] Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there.[302]\n The most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate studies, are: Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners) include Latin, Japanese, ASL, Italian, and Chinese.[303][304] 18% of all Americans claim to speak at least one language in addition to English.[305]\n Languages spoken at home by more than 1 million persons in the U.S. (2016)[306][307][fn 13]\n Language Percent of\n population Number of\n speakers Number who\n speak English\n very well Number who\n speak English\n less than\n very well\n English (only) ~80% 237,810,023 N/A N/A\n Spanish\n (including Spanish Creole but excluding Puerto Rico) 13% 40,489,813 23,899,421 16,590,392\n Chinese\n (all varieties, including Mandarin and Cantonese) 1.0% 3,372,930 1,518,619 1,854,311\n Tagalog\n (including Filipino) 0.5% 1,701,960 1,159,211 542,749\n Vietnamese 0.4% 1,509,993 634,273 875,720\n Arabic\n (all varieties) 0.3% 1,231,098 770,882 460,216\n French\n (including Patois and Cajun) 0.3% 1,216,668 965,584 251,087\n Korean 0.2% 1,088,788 505,734 583,054\n Religion\n Main article: Religion in the United States\n See also: History of religion in the United States, Freedom of religion in the United States, Separation of church and state in the United States, and List of religious movements that began in the United States\n Religious affiliation in the U.S. (2014)[7]\n Affiliation % of U.S. population\n Christian 70.6\n Protestant 46.5\n Evangelical Protestant 25.4\n Mainline Protestant 14.7\n Black church 6.5\n Catholic 20.8\n Mormon 1.6\n Jehovah’s Witnesses 0.8\n Eastern Orthodox 0.5\n Other Christian 0.4\n Jewish 1.9\n Muslim 0.9\n Buddhist 0.7\n Hindu 0.7\n Other faiths 1.8\n Irreligious 22.8\n Nothing in particular 15.8\n Agnostic 4.0\n Atheist 3.1\n Don’t know or refused answer 0.6\n The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.\n Christianity is by far the most common religion practiced in the U.S., but other religions are followed, too. In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a “very important role in their lives”, a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.[308] In a 2009 Gallup poll, 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.[309] Experts, researchers and authors have referred to the United States as a “Protestant nation” or “founded on Protestant principles,”[310][311][312][313] specifically emphasizing its Calvinist heritage.[314][315][316]\n As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30.[317] Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion has been declining since the mid to late 1980s,[318] and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious.[7][319] According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time.[320][321] Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.[322]\n According to a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults identified themselves as Christian,[323] Protestant denominations accounted for 46.5%, while Roman Catholicism, at 20.8%, was the largest individual denomination.[324] The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2014 was 5.9%.[324] Other religions include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%), Buddhism (0.7%), Hinduism (0.7%).[324] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in 1990.[324][325][326] There are also Unitarian Universalist, Baha’i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.[327]\n Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism, and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination. Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin primarily in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas and, in part, in the English Catholic Proprietary of Maryland,[328] It later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island has the highest percentage of Catholics with 40 percent of the total population.[329] Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe and Germany. North and South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Presbyterianism was introduced in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants. Although it has spread across the United States, it is heavily concentrated on the East Coast. Dutch Reformed congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam (New York City) before spreading westward. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.[330]\n The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation’s average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.[309]\n Family structure\n Main article: Family structure in the United States\n As of 2007, 58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 25% had never been married.[331] Women now work mostly outside the home and receive a majority of bachelor’s degrees.[332]\n The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991.[333] In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, and the lowest in Wyoming.[333][334] Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[335] In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.[336]\n The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births per woman.[337] Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).[338] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[339] Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide and it is legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[340]\n Government and politics\n Main articles: Federal government of the United States, State governments of the United States, Local government in the United States, and Elections in the United States\n The United States Capitol,\n where Congress meets:\n the Senate, left; the House, right\n The White House, home and workplace of the U.S. President\n Supreme Court Building, where the nation’s highest court sits\n The United States is the world’s oldest surviving federation. It is a representative democracy, “in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law”.[341] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country’s supreme legal document.[342] For 2016, the U.S. ranked 21st on the Democracy Index[343] (tied with Italy) and 18th on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[344]\n In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government’s duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is rare at lower levels.[345]\n The federal government is composed of three branches:\n Legislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[346] and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[347]\n Executive: The President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to Congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.[348]\n Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the President with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[349]\n The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census, seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, had 53.[350]\n The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[351] The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[352]\n The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature.[353] The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote.\n The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the “great writ” of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[354] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans’ individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[355] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[356]\n Political divisions\n Main articles: Political divisions of the United States, U.S. state, Territories of the United States, List of states and territories of the United States, and Indian reservation\n Further information: Territorial evolution of the United States and United States territorial acquisitions\n Map of U.S. Economic Exclusion Zone,[357] highlighting states, territories and possessions\n The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and eleven uninhabited island possessions.[358] The states and territories are the principal administrative districts in the country. These are divided into subdivisions of counties and independent cities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, Washington DC.[359] The states and the District of Columbia choose the President of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their Representatives and Senators in Congress; the District of Columbia has three.[360]\n Congressional Districts are reapportioned among the states following each decennial Census of Population. Each state then draws single member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The total number of Representatives is 435, and delegate Members of Congress represent the District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories.[361]\n The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states’ sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they have a great deal of autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.[362]\n Parties and elections\n Main articles: Politics of the United States and Political ideologies in the United States\n Congressional leadership meeting with then-President Obama in 2011.[363]\n Donald Trump\n 45th President\n since January 20, 2017\n Mike Pence\n 48th Vice President\n since January 20, 2017\n The United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its history.[364] For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate–former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912–has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.[365]\n Within American political culture, the center-right Republican Party is considered “conservative” and the center-left Democratic Party is considered “liberal”.[366][367] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as “blue states”, are relatively liberal. The “red states” of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative.\n Republican Donald Trump, the winner of the 2016 presidential election, is currently serving as the 45th President of the United States.[368] Current leadership in the Senate includes Republican Vice President Mike Pence, Republican President Pro Tempore Orrin Hatch, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.[369] Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[370]\n In the 115th United States Congress, both the House of Representatives and the Senate are controlled by the Republican Party. The Senate currently consists of 52 Republicans, and 46 Democrats with 2 Independents who caucus with the Democrats; the House consists of 241 Republicans and 194 Democrats.[371] In state governorships, there are 33 Republicans, 16 Democrats, and 1 Independent.[372] Among the DC mayor and the 5 territorial governors, there are 2 Republicans, 1 Democrat, 1 New Progressive, and 2 Independents.[373]\n Foreign relations\n Main articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States\n The United Nations Headquarters was built in Midtown Manhattan in 1952.[374]\n The United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters. It is a member of the G7,[375] G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military equipment).[376]\n The United States has a “Special Relationship” with the United Kingdom[377] and strong ties with Canada,[378] Australia,[379] New Zealand,[380] the Philippines,[381] Japan,[382] South Korea,[383] Israel,[384] and several European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance, the most in the world. As a share of America’s large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast, private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.[385]\n The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau. These are Pacific island nations, once part of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands after World War II, which gained independence in subsequent years.[386]\n On October 25, 2017, Vice President Mike Pence announced at a In Defense of Christians annual dinner meeting in Washington that the United States would stop funding United Nations relief efforts, cases tackling the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, but insisted that the U.S. would instead help and aid Christians directly through the U.S. Agency for International Development.[387] Pence said that he will be visiting the Middle East in December and will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss peace agreements.[388][389]\n Government finance\n See also: Taxation in the United States and United States federal budget\n US federal debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, from 1790 to 2013.[390]\n Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state, and local government levels. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[391] During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%).[392] Based on CBO estimates,[393] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.[394]\n U.S. taxation is generally progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and is among the most progressive in the developed world.[395][396][397][398][399] The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes,[400] and about half of all taxes.[401] Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[402][403] The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[404][405] However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.[406]\n The top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes.[407] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile.[408][409] The incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades.[398][410] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.[398][411]\n During FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare &amp; Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).[392]\n The total national debt of the United States in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP) in 2014.[412][fn 14]\n Military\n Main article: United States Armed Forces\n The carrier strike groups of the Kitty Hawk, Ronald Reagan, and Abraham Lincoln with aircraft from the Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force.\n The President holds the title of commander-in-chief of the nation’s armed forces and appoints its leaders, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[417]\n Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.[418] American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force’s large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy’s 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy’s Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad,[419] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[420]\n The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[421] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA.[422] Defense’s share of U.S. spending has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.[423]\n  \n US global military presence.\n The proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.[424] The last American troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011;[425] 4,484 service members were killed during the Iraq War.[426] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012;[427] by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan.[428]\n Law enforcement and crime\n Main articles: Law enforcement in the United States and Crime in the United States\n See also: Law of the United States, Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, Human rights in the United States § Justice system, Incarceration in the United States, and Capital punishment in the United States\n Law enforcement in the U.S. is maintained primarily by local police departments.[429]\n Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police and sheriff’s departments, with state police providing broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts’ rulings and federal laws.[430] At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.[431]\n In 2015, there were 15,696 murders which was 1,532 more than in 2014, a 10.8 per cent increase, the largest since 1971.[432] The murder rate in 2015 was 4.9 per 100,000 people.[433] In 2016 the murder rate increased by 8.6%, with 17,250 murders that year.[434] The national clearance rate for homicides in 2015 was 64.1%, compared to 90% in 1965.[435] In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980.[436] In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other developed nations.[437] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States “homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.”[438] Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject of contentious political debate.\n From 1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of homicide victims and 90% of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites (“whites” includes most Hispanics), and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims killed by whites.[439] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.[440] The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes.[441]\n Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and used in 31 states.[442][443] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.[444] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.[445]\n The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and total prison population in the world.[446] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults.[447] In December 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision in December 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997.[448] The prison population has quadrupled since 1980,[449] and state and local spending on prisons and jails has grown three times as much as that spent on public education during the same period.[450] However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013[451] and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012.[452] The country’s high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies.[453] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[454] The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been a subject of debate.[455][456] In 2008, Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate,[457] and Maine the lowest.[458]\n Economy\n Main article: Economy of the United States\n See also: Economic history of the United States\n Economic indicators\n Nominal GDP $18.45 trillion (Q2 2016) [459]\n Real GDP growth 1.4% (Q2 2016) [459]\n 2.6% (2015) [460]\n CPI inflation 1.1% (August 2016) [461]\n Employment-to-population ratio 59.7% (August 2016) [462]\n Unemployment 4.9% (August 2016) [463]\n Labor force participation rate 62.8% (August 2016) [464]\n Total public debt $19.808 trillion (October 25, 2016) [465]\n Household net worth $89.063 trillion (Q2 2016) [466]\n United States export treemap (2011): The U.S. is the world’s second-largest exporter.\n The United States has a capitalist mixed economy[467] which is fueled by abundant natural resources and high productivity.[468] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[469]\n The nominal GDP of the U.S. is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014[470] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[471] The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita (first in the Americas)[33][32] and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP.[469] The U.S. dollar is the world’s primary reserve currency.[472] The U.S. economy is also the fastest growing in the Americas.[33][32]\n The United States is the largest importer of goods and second-largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.[473] Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.[474] In 2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the country’s largest export.[473] Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt.[475] The largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve, who hold the majority of the debt.[476][477][478][479][fn 15]\n In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%.[482] The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1.[483] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power.[484] The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing.[485] In the franchising business model, McDonald’s and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the world.[486]\n Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field.[487] The United States is the largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its second-largest importer.[488] It is the world’s number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The National Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium, copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, titanium and others.[489][490]\n Agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP,[484] yet the United States is the world’s top producer of corn[491] and soybeans.[492] The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food, representing half of the world’s biotech crops.[493]\n Consumer spending comprises 68% of the U.S. economy in 2015.[494] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe.[495] The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers.[496] The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to.[497]\n The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation[498] and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia.[499] While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations.[500] 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits.[500] In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.[501]\n The 2008–2012 global recession significantly affected the United States, with output still below potential according to the Congressional Budget Office.[502] It brought high unemployment (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising petroleum and food prices.\n Income, poverty and wealth\n A tract housing development in San Jose, California\n Further information: Income in the United States, Poverty in the United States, Affluence in the United States, United States counties by per capita income, and Income inequality in the United States\n Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD nations, and in 2007 had the second-highest median household income.[503][504][505] According to the Census Bureau, median household income was $59,039 in 2016. [506] Accounting for 4.4% of the global population, Americans collectively possess 41.6% of the world’s total wealth,[507] and Americans make up roughly half of the world’s population of millionaires.[508] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[509] Americans on average have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and more than every EU nation.[510] For 2013 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 5th among 187 countries in its Human Development Index and 28th in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[511]\n After years of stagnant growth, in 2016, according to the Census, median household income reached a record high after two consecutive years of record growth, although income inequality remains at record highs with top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income.[512] There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[513] However, the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance.[514] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected income inequality,[515] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[516] The top 1 percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers,[517] The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.[518][disputed ][519]\n United States’ families median net worth\n source: Fed Survey of Consumer Finances[520]\n in 2013 dollars 1998 2013 change\n All families $102,500 $81,200 -20.8%\n Bottom 20% of incomes $8,300 $6,100 -26.5%\n 2nd lowest 20% of incomes $47,400 $22,400 -52.7%\n Middle 20% of incomes $76,300 $61,700 -19.1%\n Top 10% $646,600 $1,130,700 +74.9%\n Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country’s household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.[521] According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country’s wealth in 2016.[522] Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[523] Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down $14 trillion, but has since increased $14 trillion over 2006 levels.[524][525] At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to $11.8 trillion,[526] down from $13.8 trillion at the end of 2008.[527]\n There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[528] In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic.[529] According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty today, up from one in seven in 1980.[530]\n Infrastructure\n Transportation\n Main article: Transportation in the United States\n The Interstate Highway System, which extends 46,876 miles (75,440 km).[531]\n Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million km) of public roads,[532] including one of the world’s longest highway systems at 57,000 miles (91700 km).[533] The world’s second-largest automobile market,[534] the United States has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans.[535] About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.[536] The average American adult (accounting for all drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling 29 miles (47 km).[537]\n  \n Map showing current rail speeds in the United States.[538]\n Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips.[539][540] Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, partly because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior.[541][542] However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010.[543] Also, light rail development has increased in recent years.[544] Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.[545]\n The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[546] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[547] Of the world’s 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and the fourth-busiest, O’Hare International Airport in Chicago.[548] In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks of 2001, the Transportation Security Administration was created to police airports and commercial airliners.\n Energy\n Further information: Energy policy of the United States\n The U.S. power transmission grid consists of about 300,000 km (190,000 mi) of lines operated by approximately 500 companies. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) oversees all of them.\n The United States energy market is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year.[549] Energy consumption per capita is 7.8 tons (7076 kg) of oil equivalent per year, the 10th-highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[550] The United States is the world’s largest consumer of petroleum.[551]The United States has 27% of global coal reserves.[552] It is the world’s largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.[553]\n For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception in the wake of a 1979 accident. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants were filed.[554]\n Water supply and sanitation\n Main article: Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States\n Issues that affect water supply in the United States include droughts in the West, water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.[555][556][fn 16]\n Education\n Main article: Education in the United States\n The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of the many public universities in the United States. Universal government-funded education exists in the United States, while there are also many privately funded institutions.\n American public education is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[559]\n About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[560] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student.[561] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[562]\n The United States has many competitive private and public institutions of higher education. The majority of the world’s top universities listed by different ranking organizations are in the U.S.[563][564][565] There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor’s degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[566] The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.[225][567] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[568]\n As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[561][569] As of 2012, student loan debt exceeded one trillion dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards.[570]\n Culture\n Main article: Culture of the United States\n See also: Alaska Natives § Cultures, Native American cultures in the United States, Culture of the Native Hawaiians, Social class in the United States, Public holidays in the United States, and Tourism in the United States\n The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[571][572] Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries.[573] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[571][574] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[571]\n Core American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism,[575] as well as a unifying belief in an “American creed” emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[576] Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times the French figure of 0.14%.[577][578]\n The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[579] Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate.[580][581][582][583][471][584] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[585] scholars identify significant differences between the country’s social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[586] Americans’ self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree.[587] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.[588]\n Food\n Main article: Cuisine of the United States\n Apple pie is a food commonly associated with American cuisine.\n Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour[589] and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers.[590] These home grown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America’s most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[591]\n  \n Roasted turkey is a traditional menu item of an American Thanksgiving dinner.[592]\n Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[593] Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea.[594] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[595][596]\n American eating habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary roots with some variations. Although American lands could grow newer vegetables that Britain could not, most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by Europeans.[597] Over time American foods changed to a point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in 1972: “Our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence”.[598]\n The American fast food industry, the world’s largest,[599] pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s.[600] Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans’ caloric intake rose 24%;[593] frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American “obesity epidemic”.[601] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake.[602]\n Literature, philosophy, and the arts\n Main articles: American literature, American philosophy, Architecture of the United States, Visual art of the United States, and American classical music\n Mark Twain, American author and humorist.\n In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century’s second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[603] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character–such as Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)–may be dubbed the “Great American Novel”.[604]\n Twelve U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Bob Dylan in 2016. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[605] Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[606]\n The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have affected various fields in social and political philosophy.[607][608]\n In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[609] Georgia O’Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[610] Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.[611]\n  \n Times Square in New York City, the hub of the Broadway theater district[612]\n One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O’Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.[613]\n Though little known at the time, Charles Ives’s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music.\n Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance, while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet.\n Music\n Main article: Music of the United States\n The Grammy Award is awarded to leading music artists.\n The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[614]\n Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America’s most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities,[614] as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay-Z, Eminem and Kanye West.[615] Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[616][617][618]\n Cinema\n Main article: Cinema of the United States\n The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California\n Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[619] The world’s first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison’s Kinetoscope.[620] The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film’s development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[621]\n Director D. W. Griffith, the top American filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[622] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West and history, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting, with great influence on subsequent directors. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the “Golden Age of Hollywood”, from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[623] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[624][625] In the 1970s, film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were a vital component in what became known as “New Hollywood” or the “Hollywood Renaissance”,[626] grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[627] Since, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs, and in return, high earnings at the box office, with Cameron’s Avatar (2009) earning more than $2 billion.[628]\n Notable films topping the American Film Institute’s AFI 100 list include Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time,[629][630] Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler’s List (1993), Singin’ in the Rain (1952), It’s a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).[631] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[632] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[633]\n Sports\n Main article: Sports in the United States\n  \n  \n Most popular American sports are American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey[634]\n American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport;[635] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally. Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country’s next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.[636] In soccer, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men’s national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women’s team has won the FIFA Women’s World Cup three times; Major League Soccer is the sport’s highest league in the United States (featuring 19 American and 3 Canadian teams). The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[637]\n Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. As of 2014, the United States has won 2,400 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 281 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.[638] While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[639] The most watched individual sports are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.[640][641] Rugby union is considered the fastest growing sport in the U.S., with registered players numbered at 115,000+ and a further 1.2 million participants.[642]\n Media\n Main article: Media of the United States\n The corporate headquarters of the American Broadcasting Company in New York City\n The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox. The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[643] Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[644]\n In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other.) As of September 30, 2014, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[645]\n Well-known newspapers include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and USA Today.[646] Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have “alternative weeklies” to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City’s The Village Voice or Los Angeles’ LA Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.[647] Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon, and Twitter.[648]\n More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[649][650]\n Science and technology\n Main articles: Science and technology in the United States and Science policy of the United States\n Astronaut James Irwin walking on the Moon next to Apollo 15’s landing module and lunar rover in 1971. The effort to reach the Moon was triggered by the Space Race.\n The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.[651]\n In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison’s research laboratory, one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[652] The latter lead to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[653]\n The rise of Fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[654] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and aeronautics.[655][656]\n The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[657][658][659] This in turn led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.[660]\n These advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for individual use.[661] As of 2013, 83.8% of American households owned at least one computer, and 73.3% had high-speed Internet service.[662] 91% of Americans also own a mobile phone as of May 2013.[663] The United States ranks highly with regard to freedom of use of the internet.[664]\n In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector.[665] The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.[666]\n Health\n See also: Health care in the United States, Health care reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States\n New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City is one of the world’s busiest hospitals. Pictured is the Weill Cornell facility (white complex at center).\n The United States has a life expectancy of 79.8 years at birth, up from 75.2 years in 1990.[667][668][669] The infant mortality rate of 6.17 per thousand places the United States 56th-lowest out of 224 countries.[670]\n Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere contributed to lowering the country’s rank in life expectancy from 11th in the world in 1987, to 42nd in 2007.[671] Obesity rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years, are the highest in the industrialized world, and are among the highest anywhere.[672][673] Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight.[674] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.[675]\n In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer’s disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[669] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[676]\n The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the European Union and Switzerland together contributed to five.[677] Since 1966, more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.[678] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.[679]\n Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance.[680] The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[681][682] In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[683] Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.[684][685]\n  \n Special Thanks to :\n 1.

He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is a Hindu nationalist and member of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi traveled around India for two years, and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.\n Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patel’s failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[a] or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, although a court found no evidence to prosecute Modi.[b] His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise.[8] His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state.[c]\n Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election, which gave the party a majority in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984. Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modi’s administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased spending on infrastructure, and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power through the abolition of the planning commission. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.[d]\n Contents\n Early life and education\n Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.1915 – 1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c.1920).[17] Modi’s family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community,[18][19][20] which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government.[21][22]\n As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus.[23][24] Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with an interest in theatre.[25] Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and this was noted by his teachers and students.[26] Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[27][28]\n When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) for RSS and became his political mentor.[29] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP’s Gujarat unit in 1980.[30] Engaged while still a child to Jashodaben, a girl from a family who lived close by, Modi rejected the arranged marriage at the same time he graduated from high school.[31] The resulting familial tensions contributed to his decision to leave home in 1967.[32]\n Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged.[33] In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education.[34][35][36] Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi’s life.[37]\n In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati.[38] Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968–69.[39] Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad.[40] There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter’s canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[41][42]\n In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city.[43][44][45] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS,[42] working under Inamdar.[46] Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him.[46] Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001.[47]\n In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning[48] at University of Delhi,[49][50] graduating with a third class.[51] Five years later, in 1982, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University,[52][53] as an external distance learning student.[54]\n Early political career\n In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as “The Emergency”, many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[55][56] Modi was appointed general secretary of the “Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti”, an RSS committee coordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[57] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[58][59] Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[60] During this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency.[61][62] Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures.[63] In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh.[60]\n Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS’s version of the history of the Emergency.[64] He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985.[30] In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP’s campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi’s planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers.[65] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi’s work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP’s Gujarat unit later in 1987.[66]\n Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP’s National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise L. K. Advani’s 1990 Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi’s 1991–92 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity).[25][67][68] However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with Shankersingh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision.[68] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi’s electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections.[68][30][69][70] In November of that year Modi was elected BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[69][71] The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections.[25] Modi, on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections,[69][72] and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.[73]\n Chief Minister of Gujarat\n Taking office\n In 2001, Keshubhai Patel’s health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel’s standing had been damaged by his administration’s handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[69][74][75] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel’s administration, was chosen as a replacement.[25] Although BJP leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi’s lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel’s deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was “going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all”. On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections.[76] On 7 October 2001, Modi was administered the oath of office.[77] On 24 February 2002 he entered the Gujarat state legislature by winning a by-election to the Rajkot – II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 votes, which enabled him to take office.[78]\n 2002 Gujarat riots\n Main article: 2002 Gujarat riots\n On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[e] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[81][82] In making a public statement after the incident, Modi said that the attack had been terror attack planned by local Muslims.[3][81][83] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh across the state.[84][85] Riots began during the bandh, and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[81][84][85] The government’s decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[81][86] The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed.[87] Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000.[81][88] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[89] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women.[2]\n The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots,[1][2][3] and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation.[90] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism.[91][92][93] Summarising academic views on the subject, Martha Nussbaum said: “There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law.”[2] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating.[84][85] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time.[3] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[94] Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[95] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[2][83][96] In 2012 Maya Kodnani, a minister in Modi’s government from 2007 to 2009, was convicted of participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 riots.[97][98] Although Modi’s government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for Kodnani on appeal, it reversed its decision in 2013.[99][100]\n Modi’s personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, Modi said that “What is happening is a chain of action and reaction.”[2] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[101] Modi has not offered an apology for the riots.[11] In March 2008, the Supreme Court reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[90][102][103] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modi’s complicity in the killings.[102] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[102][104] In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT’s position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[105][106] The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate’s court. The SIT examined Ramachandran’s report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jaffri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013 the magistrate’s court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT’s finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister.[107]\n 2002 election\n In the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[108] Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted.[109] His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved.[110][111] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[112] In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[113] Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[114][115][116][117] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters.[112] Modi hired the public relations firm APCO Worldwide to manage his image.[112] He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 1,13,589 of 1,54,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes.[118] On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term.[119] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly.[1][114]\n Second term\n During Modi’s second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat’s economic development.[74][1][114] Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP),[120] entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad’s textile industry,[74] and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers’ demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[120][121] Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi’s administrative decisions.[120] Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a forward to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[122][123]\n Modi’s relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister)[124][125] distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP’s electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[126][127]\n Questions about Modi’s relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act,[128][129] the only person denied a US visa under this law.[130] The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[131] and the EU[132] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.[133][134]\n During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[135] In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ” for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation” such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings.[136] In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a “spiritual experience” for Dalits.[137][138][139] However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct.[140] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat’s 1,600-kilometre (990 mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats.[141] In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post,[142] and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year’s election.[143]\n Development projects\n The Sardar Sarovar Dam during a 2006 height increase.\n As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion were signed.[74]\n The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[144] Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[145] As a result, the state’s production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India.[144] The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[146] led to Gujarat’s agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.[147] Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4–6% of the area intended.[144] Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent – the highest of any state.[146] However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992–97 INC government was 12.9 percent.[148] In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata’s to Gujarat.[149]\n The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed.[148] Modi significantly changed the state’s system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised,[144] according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[150]\n Development debate\n Modi speaking at flower-decked podium\n Modi addressing graduates of the Gujarat National Law University in 2012.\n There has been a contentious debate surrounding the development of the state of Gujarat during Modi’s tenure as chief minister.[151] The GDP growth rate of Gujarat averaged 10% during Modi’s tenure, a value above that of the country as a whole, and similar to other highly industrialised states.[149] Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office.[152] Some scholars have stated the rate of growth did not accelerate during Modi’s tenure,[152] although the state is considered to have maintained a high growth rate during Modi’s Chief Ministership.[95] Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank’s “ease of doing business” rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.[153] In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for “economic freedom” by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens’ rights and labour and business regulation among the country’s 20 largest states.[149][154] In the later years of Modi’s government, Gujarat’s economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.[1] Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land. Modi’s policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened.[114]\n Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi’s tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the “alarming” category on the India State Hunger Index.[155][156] A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in children.[157]\n Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.[95] It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.[95] With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most Indian states.[95] The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.[95] Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index. Political Scientist Christophe Jaffrelot says that under Modi the number of families below the poverty line has increased and conditions for rural adivasi and dalits, in particular, have declined.[5] Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare.[95] In July 2013, economics Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen expressed disapproval of Modi’s governance record, saying that under his administration Gujarat’s “record in education and healthcare is pretty bad”.[158] However, economists Arvind Panagariya and Jagdish Bhagwati say that Gujarat’s social indicators have improved from a lower baseline than that of other Indian states. According to them, Gujarat’s performance in raising literacy rates has been superior to other states and the “rapid” improvement of health indicators is evidence that “its progress has not been poor by any means.”[159]\n Final years\n Modi talking to a woman; both are seated.\n Modi with Anandiben Patel at a meeting of BJP MLAs after his election as prime minister; Patel succeeded him as Gujarat chief minister.\n Further information: Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, 2012\n During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[114]\n Despite the BJP’s shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi’s election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.[114] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[114] His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012.[114] He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji (“Guru worthy of worship”).[160] According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.[161]\n While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people,[112] something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt.[162] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure[163] and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995).[164] In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates.[165] In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans.[166] After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister.[167]\n 2014 Indian general election\n Main article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for Indian general election, 2014\n In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP’s candidate for prime minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[168][169] Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi’s candidature,[170] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were “concerned with their personal agendas”.[171] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP’s election campaign.[172][173] Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party.[174][168][174][175] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.[170][176] The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.[151]\n During the campaign, Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat.[151][170] Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about “development,” without focus on any specific policies.[170] His message found support among young Indians and among middle-class citizens.[151] The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi’s commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism.[151] Prior to the election Modi’s image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modi’s neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development.[173] Although the BJP avoided issues of Hindu nationalism to an extent, Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign.[170][174][12] The BJP’s campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.[156] Modi’s campaign blitz cost approximately ₹50 billion (US$780 million),[151] and received extensive financial support from corporate donors.[156] In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media,[151][170] and addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearances.[12]\n The BJP won 31% of the vote,[11] and more than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984.[173][174] Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP,[174] as was the support from the RSS.[170] In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims.[174] The magnitude of the BJP’s victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing.[151][174][177][178] Modi’s tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.[179]\n Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies: Varanasi and Vadodara.[180] He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi and Madhusudan Mistry of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128 votes.[181] Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed prime minister by India’s president.[182][183] To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat.[184]\n Prime Minister\n Main article: Premiership of Narendra Modi\n For a chronological guide to this subject, see Timeline of the premiership of Narendra Modi.\n Wikinews has related news: Narendra Modi elected new Prime Minister of India.\n Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. He became the first Prime Minister born after India’s independence from the British Empire.[185] His first cabinet consisted of 45 ministers, 25 fewer than the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government.[186] 21 new ministers were added to the council of ministers in November 2014.[187]\n Economic policies\n Modi with other BRICS leaders in 2016. Left to right: Temer, Modi, Xi, Putin and Zuma.\n The economic policies of Modi’s government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, based on a neoliberal framework.[187][188] Modi liberalised India’s foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways.[187][189][190] Other reforms included removing many of the country’s labour laws, to make it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them. These reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country’s largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP.[188] The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt labourers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them.[187] In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1 percent to 3 percent over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks.[187] Over Modi’s first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5 percent, making it the world’s fastest-growing large economy.[188]\n The funds dedicated to poverty reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly decreased by the Modi administration.[123] The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6% of GDP during the Congress government to 12.6% during Modi’s first year in office.[187] Spending on health and family welfare declined by 15%, and on primary and secondary education by 16%.[187] The budgetary allocation for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, or the “education for all” programme, declined by 22%.[187] The government also lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, and reduced customs duties on gold, jewelry, and increased sales taxes.[187] In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices,[191] and later increased taxes on diesel and petrol.[187]\n Modi at the launch of the Make in India programme.\n In September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.[187][192] Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market.[187] In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it.[193] Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived.[194] The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse.[194] Modi’s government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.[195]\n On 25 June 2015, Modi launched a programme intended to develop 100 smart cities.[196] The “Smart Cities” programme is expected to bring Information Technology companies an extra benefit of ₹20 billion (US$310 million).[197] In June 2015, Modi launched the “Housing for All By 2022” project, which intends to eliminate slums in India by building about 20 million affordable homes for India’s urban poor.[198]\n In his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money.[199] On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism.[200] The move led to widespread protests throughout the country, including one by opposition parties, which stalled the winter session of parliament.[201] In the days following the demonetisation, banks across the country faced severe cash shortages,[202][203][204] which had detrimental effects on a number of small businesses, on agriculture, and on transportation. People seeking to exchange their notes had lengthy waits, and several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash.[205][206] Following Modi’s announcement, the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 declined steeply.[207][clarification needed] There has been a steep increase in digital payments and transactions in the country since the day demonetization was announced.[208] Post the demonetisation, the quantum of income tax returns filed for individuals jumped by 25% indicating the widened tax net. Further, the advance tax collections rose by 42% and Self assessment tax collections rose by 34.25%.[209]\n Health and sanitation policies\n See also: Swachh Bharat Abhiyan\n In his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the amount of money spent by the government on healthcare.[157] The Modi government launched a “New Health Policy” in January 2015, although this did not increase the government’s spending on healthcare, instead emphasizing the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including reducing child and maternal mortality rates.[210] The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices received nearly 25% less funds in 2015 than in the previous year. 15 national health programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged with the National Health Mission, and received less funds than in previous years. Modi initially appointed Harsh Vardhan, a doctor and an advocate of tobacco control, as minister of health. However, Vardhan was removed in November 2015.[210] The government introduced stricter packaging laws for tobacco which requires 85% of the packet size to be covered by pictorial warnings.[211] In its budget for the second year after it took office, the Modi government reduced healthcare spending by 15%.[210] Modi has generally emphasised his government’s efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health. An article in the medical journal Lancet stated that the country “might have taken a few steps back in public health” under Modi.[210]\n On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (“Clean India”) campaign. The stated goals of the campaign included eliminating open defecation and manual scavenging.[212][213] The plan was to achieve these aims in five years.[213] As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them.[214][215][216] The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants.[217] The administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them.[213][214][215]\n Hindutva and education policy\n During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders known to have opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Ram Manohar Lohia.[123] The campaign also saw the use of rhetoric based on Hindutva, however, by BJP leaders in certain states.[218] Communal tensions were played upon especially in Uttar Pradesh and the states of Northeast India.[218] A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP’s election manifesto.[12]\n Several state governments headed by the BJP have enacted policies aligned with Hindutva after the election of Modi as prime minister. The government of Maharashtra banned the killing of cows in 2014.[218] The Modi administration has generally avoided directly supporting policies related to a Hindutva agenda.[218] There has been an increase in the activities of a number of other Hindu nationalist organisations, sometimes with the support of the government.[123][218] The incidents included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the alleged Islamic practice of “Love Jihad”, and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right wing Hindu Mahasabha.[123] The attempts at religious conversion have been described by the VHP and other organisations involved with them as attempts at “reconversion” from Islam or Christianity. There have been a number of reports of intimidation or coercion of the subjects during these attempts.[218] Officials in the government, including the Home Minister, have defended the attempts.[218] There were additional incidents of violence targeted at religious minorities by Hindu nationalists.[123] Modi refused to remove a government minister from her position after a popular outcry resulted from her referring to religious minorities as “bastards.”[123] Commentators have suggested, however, that the violence was perpetrated by radical Hindu nationalists to undercut the authority of Modi.[123]\n The Modi administration appointed Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).[12] In reaction to his appointment, other historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the ruling party, questioned his credentials as a historian. Several stated that the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism.[12][219][220]\n The government began formulating a New Education Policy, or NEP, soon after its election. As of March 2016, this policy had yet to be implemented. This was the third education policy introduced by the Indian government, following those of 1968 and 1986. The policy was described as having overtones of Hindutva. The RSS had a role in its creation, and it did not explicitly mention the goals of “socialism, secularism and democracy” that had been mentioned in the first two policies. The policy emphasised the education of minority students, as well as those of economically backward groups, in particular on improving enrolment in schools among those groups. The policy proposed bringing religious educational institutions under the Right to Education Act. There was also a debate about removing caste-based reservation in favour of reservation based on income, a move supported by the RSS, but which was criticised as being discriminatory on the basis of caste.[221]\n Foreign policy\n Further information: Foreign policy of Narendra Modi and List of prime ministerial trips made by Narendra Modi\n President Trump Gives Joint Statements with Prime Minister Modi in the Rose Garden\n File:President Trump Gives Joint Statements with Prime Minister Modi in the Rose Garden.webmPlay media\n Prime Minister Modi and 44th President of the United States Donald Trump giving Joint Statements in the Rose Garden.\n Foreign policy played a relatively small role in Modi’s election campaign, and did not feature prominently in the BJP’s election manifesto.[222] Modi invited all the other leaders of SAARC countries to his swearing in ceremony as prime minister.[223][224] He was the first Indian prime minister to do so.[225]\n Modi’s foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding INC government, focused on improving economic ties, security, and regional relations.[222] Modi continued Manmohan Singh’s policy of “multialignment.”[226] The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially in East Asia, with the use of slogans such as “Make in India” and “Digital India”.[226] As a part of this policy, the Modi government completed India’s application to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which is led by China and Russia. (SCO).[226] The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel.[226] Modi added five bilateral strategic partnerships to the 25 that had been agreed by his predecessors Singh and Vajpayee.[226]\n During the first few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of different countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits.[222] One of Modi’s first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid.[227] Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country.[224] While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.[224]\n In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal with Bangladesh about the India–Bangladesh enclaves, which had been initiated by the government of Manmohan Singh.[194] Modi’s administration gave renewed attention to India’s “Look East Policy”, instituted in 1991. The policy was renamed the “Act East Policy”, and involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia.[226][228] The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar, through the state of Manipur. This represented a break with India’s historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade.[228] As of July 2016, Modi had made 51 trips to 42 countries with the intent of strengthening diplomatic relations.[229][230]\n Defence policy\n 10th President of Israel Reuven Rivlin and Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Gadi Eizenkot with Modi.\n The BJP election manifesto had also promised to deal with illegal immigration into India in the Northeast, as well as to be more firm in its handling of insurgent groups. During the election campaign, Modi said that he would be willing to accommodate Hindu migrants who were being persecuted in Bangladesh, but those that came with “political objectives” would have to be sent back. The Modi government issued a notification allowing Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to legalise their residency in India. The government described the measure as being taken for humanitarian reasons but it drew criticism from several Assamese organisations.[231]\n Modi continued the previous INC administration’s policy of increasing military spending every year, announcing an increase of 11% in the military budget in 2015.[232][233] This increase was larger than the average growth under the Congress.[232]\n The Modi administration negotiated a peace agreement with the largest faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCM), which was announced in August 2015. The Naga insurgency in northwest India had begun in the 1950s.[231][234] The NSCM and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a peace accord had not previously been signed.[234] In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded with a series of attacks, which killed 18 people.[231] The Modi government carried out a raid across the border with Myanmar as a result, and labelled the NSCM-K a terrorist organisation.[231]\n Wikinews has related news: Prime Minister Narendra Modi accuses Pakistan of waging proxy war.\n Modi has repeatedly stated that Pakistan was an exporter of terrorism.[235][236] On 29 September 2016, the Indian Army stated that it had conducted a surgical strike on terror launchpads in Azad Kashmir,[237] although Pakistan denied the claim, and the details of the confrontation are still in dispute.[238][239]\n Environmental policies\n Modi (right) at CoP21 Climate Conference, in Paris, announcing the founding of an International Solar Alliance (ISA). November 2015.\n In naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the “Ministry of Environment and Forests” the “Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change.”[240] In the first budget of the government, the money allotted to this ministry was reduced by more than 50%.[240] The new ministry also removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection. These included no longer requiring clearance from the National Board for Wildlife for projects close to protected areas, and allowing certain projects to proceed before environmental clearance was received.[187][240] The government also tried to reconstitute the Wildlife board such that it no longer had representatives from non-governmental organisations: however, this move was prevented by the Supreme Court.[240]\n Modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating.[187][241] Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas.[241] In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries.[240] The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.[241]\n Under the UPA government that preceded Modi’s administration, field trials of Genetically Modified (GM) crops had essentially been put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods.[242] Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted.[242] The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group Greenpeace, citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze had to do with Greenpeace’s opposition to GM crops.[242]\n Governance and other initiatives\n Modi’s first year as prime minister saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations.[123][243] Modi’s efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions.[123] Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[194] The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.[11]\n On 31 December 2014, Modi announced that the Planning Commission had been scrapped. It was replaced with a body called the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog.[244][245] The Planning Commission was a legacy of the Indian Independence movement, although critics said that it was slowing economic growth.[246] The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister.[187][194][244][245][246] It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their financial allocation from the union government,[245][246] and unlike the planning commission, it does not have the power to allocate funds.[245] The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.[245]\n The Modi government launched a crackdown against a number of civil society organisations. Several tens of thousands of organisations were investigated by the Intelligence Bureau in the first year of the administration, on the grounds that they were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure.[123] Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz.[187] Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government.[123] This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi’s style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.[123][194]\n Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister, against a total of 1,301 such laws repealed by previous governments over a span of 64 years.[247][248][249] He started a monthly radio programme titled “Mann Ki Baat” on 3 October 2014.[250] Modi also launched the Digital India programme, which has the goal of ensuring that government services are available electronically, building infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boosting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promoting digital literacy.[251][252]\n Personal life and image\n Further information: Public image of Narendra Modi\n In accordance with Ghanchi tradition, Modi’s marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child. He was engaged at age 13 to Jashodaben, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu ashrams.[25][253] Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a ‘pracharak’ in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh.[254][49] Although Modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career, he acknowledged his wife when he filed his nomination for a parliamentary seat in the 2014 general elections.[255][256] Modi maintains a close relationship with his mother, Hiraben and often visits her on his birthday to seek her blessings.[257]\n A vegetarian,[258] Modi has a frugal lifestyle and is a workaholic and introvert.[259] Adept at using social media, he has been since September 2014 the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 34.6 million followers on Twitter as of September 2017), behind Barack Obama (95.6 million followers) and Donald Trump(38.8 million followers).[260][261] Modi’s 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat.[262][263] Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, as well as for a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism.[264][265][266] Modi’s personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic.[11][267]\n The nomination of Modi for the prime ministership drew attention to his reputation as “one of contemporary India’s most controversial and divisive politicians.”[151][268][269][270] During the 2014 election campaign the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader, who would be able to take difficult decisions.[151][170][168][174][175] Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, in a manner unusual for the BJP and RSS.[170] Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and “development”.[271] Nonetheless, his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy.[4] Modi’s hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[4][170][11][123]\n As prime minister, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of people rating him “very favorably” and 93% approving of his government.[272] His approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% through his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani.[273] At the end of his second year in office, an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him “very favorably.”[274][275] At the end of his third year in office, The Times of India poll showed that 77% of the respondents rated him as “very good” and “good”.[276]\n Awards and recognition\n Modi was named the Best Chief Minister in a 2007 nationwide survey by India Today.[277] In March 2012, he appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of Time Magazine, one of the few Indian politicians to have done so.[278] He was awarded Indian of the Year by CNN-IBN news network in 2014.[279] In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he was named one of Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World.[280][281][282] He was also declared winner of the Time magazine reader’s poll for Person of the Year in 2014 and as well as in 2016.[283][284] Forbes Magazine ranked him the 15th-Most-Powerful Person in the World in 2014 and the 9th-Most-Powerful Person in the World in 2015 and 2016.[285][286][287][288] In 2015, Modi was ranked the 13th-Most-Influential Person in the World by Bloomberg Markets Magazine.[289] In the same year he was named one of Time’s “30 Most Influential People on the Internet” as the second-most-followed politician on Twitter and Facebook.[290] Modi was ranked fifth on Fortune Magazine’s first annual list of the “World’s Greatest Leaders” in 2015.[291][292] In 2016, a wax statue of Modi was unveiled at Madame Tussaud Wax Museum in London.[293][294]\n State honours\n Decoration Country Date Note Ref.\n Spange des König-Abdulaziz-Ordens.png\n Order of Abdulaziz al Saud Saudi Arabia 3 April 2016 Member Special Class, The highest civilian honor of Saudi Arabia [295]\n Ghazi Amanullah Khan Medal (Afghanistan) – ribbon bar.png\n State Order of Ghazi Amir Amanullah Khan Afghanistan 4 June 2016 The highest civilian honor of Afghanistan [296]\n References\n External links\n Wikimedia Commons has media related to Narendra Modi.\n Wikiquote has quotations related to: Narendra Modi\n Official\n Official website (Prime Minister’s office)\n Official website (personal)\n Official page on Bharatiya Janata Party’s website\n Appearances on C-SPAN\n Political offices\n Preceded by\n Keshubhai Patel Chief Minister of Gujarat\n 2001–2014 Succeeded by\n Anandiben Patel\n Preceded by\n Manmohan Singh Prime Minister of India\n 2014–present Incumbent\n Lok Sabha\n Preceded by\n Murli Manohar Joshi Member of the Lok Sabha\n for Varanasi\n 2014–present Incumbent\n  \n  \n  \n –  Aryan Yadav\n CEO and Founder The Aryan Yadav Foundation ®\n Special Thanks to :\n 1.

He met Hillary Rodham at Yale and married her in 1975. After graduating from Yale, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as the Attorney General of Arkansas, serving from 1977 to 1979. As Governor of Arkansas, Clinton overhauled the state’s education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in 1992, defeating incumbent Republican opponent George H. W. Bush. At age 46, he became the third-youngest president and the first from the Baby Boomer generation.\n Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress for the first time in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. During the last three years of Clinton’s presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.\n Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office approval rating of any U.S. president since World War II, and he has continually received high ratings in public opinion polls of U.S. presidents. Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes, such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming. He has remained active in politics by campaigning for Democratic candidates, including his wife’s presidential campaigns and Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life. In 2009, Clinton was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he teamed with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund.\n Listen to this article (info/dl)\n  \n  \n This audio file was created from a revision of the article “Bill Clinton” dated 2012-06-04, and does not reflect subsequent edits to the article. (Audio help)\n More spoken articles\n Contents\n Early life and career\n  \n Clinton’s childhood home in Hope, Arkansas\n Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas.[1][2] He was the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr. (1918–1946), a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley: 1923–1994).[3] His parents married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife.[4] Soon after Bill was born, Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing. She left her son in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store.[2] At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton’s grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races.[2] In 1950, Bill’s mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks.[2] The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.[5]\n Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather’s surname, it was not until Clinton turned fifteen[6] that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.[2] Clinton said that he remembered his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr., to the point where he intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.[2][7]\n  \n Clinton with his saxophone at the White House in 1996. He began playing the saxophone in elementary school. At one point, Clinton considered pursuing a career in music.\n In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John’s Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School, where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.[2] Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band’s saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life:\n Sometime in my sixteenth year, I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official. I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never be John Coltrane or Stan Getz. I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine doctor, but I knew I would never be Michael DeBakey. But I knew I could be great in public service.[2]\n Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman Senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class.[8] After a vigorous defense that made use of his “budding rhetorical and political skills”, he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck that it “made him realize that someday he would study law”.[9]\n Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy.[2][7] The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 I Have a Dream speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.[10]\n College and law school years\n Georgetown University\n Clinton ran for president of the Student Council while attending the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.\n With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree in 1968.\n In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for class president.[11] From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright.[2] While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega[12] and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Clinton was also a member of the Order of DeMolay,[13] a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.[14]\n Oxford\n Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College in Oxford, England, where he initially read for a B.Phil. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics.[15] Clinton did not expect the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at Yale Law School, Yale University, but he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.[7][16][17]\n During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller’s 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.[15][18] British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, “I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn’t good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren’t enough and you had to do something about such things”.[15] He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.[19]\n While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being “a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace”, having “a powerful collaborator in his wife,” and for winning “general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget”.[16][20]\n Vietnam War opposition and draft controversy\n While at Oxford, Clinton also participated in Vietnam War protests and organized an October 1969 Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event.[2]\n During the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.[21] He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and was aware that he might lose his draft deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.[22]\n He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way “to maintain my political viability within the system”.[23] Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers 1 to 310 would have to be drafted before him, making it unlikely that he would be drafted. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)[24]\n Colonel Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton’s ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:\n I was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to Senator Fulbright’s office that Bill Clinton, a Rhodes Scholar, should be admitted to the ROTC program … I believe that he purposely deceived me, using the possibility of joining the ROTC as a ploy to work with the draft board to delay his induction and get a new draft classification.[25]\n During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton’s uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.[26] Although legal, Clinton’s actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright’s influence to avoid military service.[27][28] Clinton’s 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton’s letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.[29]\n Law school\n After Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973.[2][7] In 1971, he met fellow law student Hillary Rodham in the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him.[2][30] They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California.[31] They married on October 11, 1975, and their only child, Chelsea, was born on February 27, 1980.[30]\n Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading George McGovern’s effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign’s local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk,[32] future governor of Texas Ann Richards,[33] and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) Steven Spielberg.[34]\n Early political career\n Further information: Electoral history of Bill Clinton\n Governor of Arkansas (1979–1981, 1983–1992)\n Further information: Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1978; Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1980; Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1982; Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1986; and Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1990\n After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton’s campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52 percent to 48 percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election,[35] Clinton was elected.[7]\n  \n Newly elected Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton meets with President Jimmy Carter in 1978, fifteen years before assuming the nation’s highest office.\n Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. At age 32, he became the youngest governor in the country. Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the “Boy Governor”.[36][37][38] He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas’s roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens’ anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31 percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose’s unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton’s defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation’s history.[7]\n Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey’s Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.[39] In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas’s economy and improved the state’s educational system.[40] For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.[41] He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan’s landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level.[41][42] Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan’s 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.[7]\n In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton’s wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas’s education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers’ salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history.[40] Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.[7][41] He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).[35]\n  \n Governor and Mrs. Clinton attend the Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors in the White House with President Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan, 1987.\n Also in the 1980s, The Clintons’ personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration.[43] After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.[7][44]\n According to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions.[45][46] During Clinton’s term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973).[47] As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. Later, as president, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.[48]\n 1988 Democratic presidential primaries\n In 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the Presidential race after incumbent New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady).[49] For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice as long as it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long[50] and poorly delivered.[51] Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.[41][52]\n Presidency (1993–2001)\n Main article: Presidency of Bill Clinton\n Countries visited by President Bill Clinton during his terms in office.\n During his presidency, Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs, most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance.[53][54] His policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters.[55][56] Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[57][58][59] The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69 billion in 1998, $126 billion in 1999, and $236 billion in 2000,[60] during the last three years of Clinton’s presidency.[61] Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000.[62][63] Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000.[64] At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to Chappaqua, New York in order to satisy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York.\n 1992 presidential campaign\n Further information: Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1992; United States presidential election, 1992; and Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992\n In the first primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls.[7] Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him “The Comeback Kid” for earning a firm second-place finish.[65]\n Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.[7][52] With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.[52] Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown’s home state of California.[7]\n  \n The Clintons in a White House Christmas portrait, 1993.\n During the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary’s firm pay.[2][66] Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents “for the price of one”.[67]\n Clinton was still the Governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton’s return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a New York Times article as a possible political move to counter “soft on crime” accusations.[45][68]\n Bush’s approval ratings were around 80 percent during the Gulf War, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes, which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.[52] By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40 percent.[52][69] Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention—with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform—many moderates were alienated.[70] Clinton then pointed to his moderate, “New Democrat” record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.[71] Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton.[72] Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a “new beginning”.[72]\n  \n 1992 electoral vote results.\n Clinton won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (0 electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush’s steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton’s success.[72] Clinton’s victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress,[3] the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.[73][74]\n First term (1993–1997)\n First inauguration of Bill Clinton (January 20, 1993)\n File:First Inaugural (January 20, 1993) Bill Clinton.ogvPlay media\n Video of the First inauguration of Bill Clinton\n First inauguration of Bill Clinton (January 20, 1993)\n audio only version\n Problems playing these files?

There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.”\n Inaugural address, January 20, 1993.[75]\n Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,[76] and was popular with the public.[77]\n Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993—the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade—Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.[78] Clinton said that abortion should be kept “safe, legal, and rare”—a slogan that had been suggested by University of California, San Diego political scientist Samuel L. Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.[79] During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent.[80]\n On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit.[81] Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.[82] Clinton’s advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.[83]\n On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office, causing the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.[84] Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.[85]\n  \n Clinton and Vice President Al Gore on the South Lawn, August 10, 1993.\n In August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15 million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90 percent of small businesses,[86] and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years through the implementation of spending restraints.[87]\n On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton’s legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.[44] Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.[41][44]\n In November 1993, David Hale—the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy—alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons’ partner in the Whitewater land deal.[88] A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife’s innocence in the affair.\n On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.[44]\n In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator. In the affair later known as “Troopergate”, the officers alleged that they arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated “bad journalism”, and that “the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives”.[89]\n  \n Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat during the Oslo Accords on September 13, 1993\n Clinton, Jordan’s King Hussein and Yitzhak Rabin sign the Israel–Jordan peace treaty on July 25, 1994.\n Remarks on the Signing of NAFTA (December 8, 1993)\n File:Remarks on the Signing of NAFTA (December 8, 1993) Bill Clinton.ogvPlay media\n Clinton’s December 8, 1993 remarks on the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement\n Remarks on the Signing of NAFTA (December 8, 1993)\n audio only version\n Problems playing these files? See media help.\n That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”, which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual’s sexual orientation.[90] The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton’s proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton’s support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that “the President should lift the ban … even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress”.[91] Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.[92] Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton’s defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.[41] Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not “out of whack”.[93] The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.[94]\n On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law.[95] Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.[95]\n The Omnibus Crime Bill, which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,[96] made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton’s re-election campaign he said, “My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.”[97] It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period.\n The Clinton administration also launched the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov, on October 21, 1994.[98][99] It was followed by three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.[100][101] The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, “Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America’s government to more of America’s citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011 – Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.”[102]\n After two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.[103]\n  \n Clinton’s coat of arms, granted by the Chief Herald of Ireland in 1995\n Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in October 1995\n The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.[104] In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined that there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray’s report further stated, “there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved” in seeking the files.[105]\n On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman, allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states.[106] Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that Clinton’s signing of DOMA “was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election”. In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was an attempt to “head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states”, a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a “very reactionary Congress”.[107] Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, “the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.”[108] Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something “which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it’s obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that”.[109] Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims “historic revisionism”.[108] In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, “The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.”[110] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.[111]\n Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,[112] and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights.[113] During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees[114] and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.[115] Under Clinton’s leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled.[116] Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.[117] Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton’s election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign.[113] Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009[118] and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.[119] He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.[120]\n “When I took office, only high energy physicists had ever heard of what is called the Worldwide Web … Now even my cat has its own page.”\n Bill Clinton’s announcement of Next Generation Internet initiative, October 1996.[121]\n The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself. The Chinese government denied all accusations.[122]\n As part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton,[123] the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.[124][125]\n Ken Gormley, author of The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED).[126] According to officials, the IED was large enough to “blow up the entire presidential motorcade”.[127] Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating that there was a wedding cake under a bridge.[126] This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton’s motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila.[127] Once more, the word “wedding” was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt.[127] Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high.[128] Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag.[129] Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base.[129] The president was scheduled to visit both of these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden.[127] Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.[127]\n 1996 presidential election\n 1996 electoral vote results.\n President Bill Clinton (center), first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton (right) and their daughter Chelsea (left) wave to watchers at a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day, January 20, 1997.\n In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2 percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7 percent of the popular vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4 percent of the popular vote), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once.[130] The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70 percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.\n Second term (1997–2001)\n Al Gore and Newt Gingrich applaud as Clinton waves during the State of the Union address in 1997.\n In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.[131] In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.[132]\n Impeachment and acquittal\n Main article: Impeachment of Bill Clinton\n Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999\n After the 1998 elections, the House impeached Clinton, alleging perjury and obstruction of justice related to the Lewinsky scandal.[44] Clinton was only the second U.S. president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson. Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky.[133] After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed “substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment”,[134] the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998.\n  \n Clinton shaking hands with future president Donald Trump at Trump Tower, June 2000\n While the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton’s testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones’s sexual harassment lawsuit.[135] The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.\n The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges.[136] The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams &amp; Connolly.[137] The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge[136] and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.[138] Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.[136]\n On January 19, 2001, Clinton’s law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case.[139][140]\n Pardons and commutations\n Clinton controversially issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.[44][141] Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton’s brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president’s decision-making regarding the pardons.[142] Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey, who found no wrongdoing on Clinton’s part. Some of Clinton’s pardons remain a point of controversy.[143]\n Military and foreign events\n Further information: Foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration\n Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair in Florence, Italy on November 20, 1999.\n Clinton speaks with Col. Paul Fletcher, USAF, before boarding Air Force One, November 4, 1999.\n Many military events occurred during Clinton’s presidency. The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets—a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft attacked Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.\n  \n General John P. Jumper, U.S. Air Forces in Europe commander, escorts Clinton upon his arrival to Ramstein Air Base, Germany, May 5, 1999. The president visited several European air bases to thank the troops for their support of NATO Operations Allied Force and Shining Hope.\n In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8 million in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser.[144]\n Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until bin Laden’s death in 2011).[145] Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer[146] the 9/11 Commission Report stated that “we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim”.[147]\n In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, both of which were unsuccessful.[148] In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden’s terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.[149]\n  \n Clinton greets Air Force personnel at Spangdahlem Air Base, May 5, 1999.\n To stop the ethnic cleansing and genocide[150][151] of Albanians by anti-guerilla military units in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s province of Kosovo, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region.[152] NATO announced that its forces had suffered zero combat deaths,[153] and two deaths from an Apache helicopter crash.[154] Opinions in the popular press criticized pre-war genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated.[155][156] In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide did not take place, but recognized “a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments”.[157] The term “ethnic cleansing” was used as an alternative to “genocide” to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is no difference.[158] Slobodan Milošević, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges of crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes.[159] Milošević died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.[159][160]\n In Clinton’s 1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:\n Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation’s wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq’s arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, “You cannot defy the will of the world”, and when I say to him, “You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.[161]\n File:Video Recording of Photo Opportunity at Camp David – NARA – 6037428.ogvPlay media\n President Clinton, Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Camp David, July 2000\n Seeking to weaken Hussein’s grip on power, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of “regime change” against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.[162][163] The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that “So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.”[164] American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.[165][166]\n Clinton’s November 2000 visit to Vietnam was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the Vietnam War.[167] On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.–China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People’s Republic of China.[168] The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.[169] Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.[170]\n After initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which also led to the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000, which lasted 14 days.[44] Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton stated Arafat “missed the opportunity” to facilitate a “just and lasting peace”. In his autobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit.[2][171] Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.[44]\n Judicial appointments\n Main articles: Bill Clinton Supreme Court candidates and List of federal judges appointed by Bill Clinton\n Ruth Bader Ginsburg accepting her nomination to the Supreme Court from President Clinton.\n Clinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993[172] and Stephen Breyer in 1994.[173]\n Along with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84 percent of his nominees were confirmed.[174]\n Sonia Sotomayor was one of the judges who Clinton appointed to the Court of Appeals. She was nominated by Clinton in 1997 to the Second Circuit. Sotomayor was confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year that was caused by Republican opposition.[175][176]\n Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.[177] In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton’s court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women.[178] Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams).[178] Clinton also appointed the nation’s first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.[179]\n Public opinion\n  \n Clinton’s approval ratings throughout his presidential career\n Throughout Clinton’s first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[180] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton’s rating reached its highest point.[181] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68 percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[182] Clinton’s average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[183] Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[183]\n As he was leaving office, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll revealed that 45 percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55 percent thought he “would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life”; 68 percent thought he would be remembered more for his “involvement in personal scandal” than for “his accomplishments”; and 58 percent answered “No” to the question “Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?”[183] The same percentage said he would be remembered as either “outstanding” or “above average” as a president, while 22 percent said he would be remembered as “below average” or “poor”.[183] ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, “You can’t trust him, he’s got weak morals and ethics – and he’s done a heck of a good job.”[184]\n In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton’s job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.[185] Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.[186][187]\n In 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.[188] The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.[188]\n A 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.[189]\n Public image\n Main article: Public image of Bill Clinton\n See also: Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations\n Clinton addressing the British parliament on November 29, 1995.\n As the first baby boomer president, Clinton was the first chief executive since Calvin Coolidge who was not alive during World War II.[190] Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward stated that Clinton’s innovative use of sound bite-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings.[191][192] When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show, he was described by some religious conservatives as “the MTV president”.[193] Opponents sometimes referred to him as “Slick Willie”, a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg;[194] Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor.[194] The claim “Slick Willie” would last throughout his presidency.[195] Standing at a height of 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), Clinton is tied with five others as the fourth-tallest president in the nation’s history.[196][197] His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba, especially in the South.[198] Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as “The Big Dog” or “Big Dog”.[199][200] His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname “Explainer-in-Chief”.[201][202]\n Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.[203] In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton “the first Black president”, saying, “Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald’s-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas”.[204] Morrison noted that Clinton’s sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that blacks typically endure.[204] Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging to both Clinton and the African-American community at large.[205] Clinton, a Baptist,[206] has been open about his faith.[207]\n Shortly after Clinton took office, Richard Mellon Scaife, a conservative newspaper owner, organized a fundraising campaign to smear Clinton’s image in the media.[208] Leading the Arkansas Project, Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton’s home state of Arkansas who would be willing to dish out negative allegations against the president.[208]\n  \n Clinton at a Democratic “Get out the vote” rally in Los Angeles, California, on November 2, 2000\n In 1994, Paula Jones initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, claiming that he made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.[209] Jones appealed Webber Wright’s ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton’s admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.[210] In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton’s main lawyer for the case, called the filing “a pack of lies” and “an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States” funded by Clinton’s political enemies.[211] Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000.[212] Bennett said that the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life.[213] During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House,[214] Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky – a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.[215]\n In 1992, Gennifer Flowers stated that she had a relationship with Clinton that began in 1980.[216] Flowers at first denied that she had an affair with Clinton, but later changed her story.[217][218] After Clinton at first denied having a relationship with Flowers on 60 Minutes, he later admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.[219]\n  \n Clinton speaking at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.\n In 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave “false information” to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[220] On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey’s account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office.[221] An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.[222] Linda Tripp’s grand jury testimony also differed from Willey’s claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.[223]\n Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she stated she did not remember the exact date.[224] In another 1998 event, Elizabeth Gracen recanted a six-year-old denial and stated she had a one-night stand with Clinton in 1982.[225] Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton.[226] Throughout the year, however, Gracen eluded a subpoena from Kenneth Starr to testify her claim in court.[227]\n Post-presidency (2001–present)\n Main article: Post-presidency of Bill Clinton\n Clinton greets a Hurricane Katrina evacuee, September 5, 2005. In the background, second from the right, is then-Senator Barack Obama.\n Bill Clinton continues to be active in public life, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations.[228] Clinton has spoken in prime time at every Democratic National Convention since 1988.[229] Robert Reich has suggested that Clinton is in a state of “permanent election”, due to the impeachment proceedings during his presidency and his continuing support in the campaigns of his wife Hillary Clinton.[230]\n Activities until 2008 campaign\n In 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,[231][232] and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this).[233] In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.[234]\n The William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas was dedicated in 2004.[235] Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, My Life in 2004.[236] In 2007, he released Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World, which also became a New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews.[237]\n  \n Former president George H. W. Bush and Clinton in the White House Library, January 2005\n In the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort.[238] After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year.[239] As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show,[240] and traveled to the affected areas.[241] They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.[242]\n  \n The dedication of the Clinton Presidential Center, 2004\n Based on his philanthropic worldview,[243] Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict.[244] In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools.[245] Clinton’s foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.[246] The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East.[247] In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30 percent in developing nations.[248] Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.[249]\n 2008 presidential election\n Clinton speaking at the 2008 Democratic National Convention\n During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary Clinton. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10 million toward her campaign.[250] Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.[251] Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary’s staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.[252] Considering Bill’s remarks, many thought that he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary.[253] Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama’s election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying that all his experience as president assures him that Obama is “ready to lead”.[254] After Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.[255][256]\n After the 2008 election\n Clinton with incumbent President Barack Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett in July 2010\n In 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.[257] Jimmy Carter had made a similar visit in 1994.[257] After Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.[258][259]\n Since then, Clinton has been assigned a number of other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009.[260] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti’s recovery.[261] Clinton continues to visit Haiti to witness the inauguration of refugee villages, and to raise funds for victims of the earthquake.[262] In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland’s first environmental foundation.[263][264] At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.[265]\n 2016 presidential election\n Clinton campaigning at an election rally for his wife who was running to become the President of the United States, 2016\n During the 2016 Presidential Election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary Clinton, including a campaign stop in Wilmington, NC.[266] In a series of tweets, then-President-Elect Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote.[267]\n After the 2016 election\n On September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[268]\n Post-presidential health concerns\n In September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery.[269] In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung.[270] On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart.[269][271] After this procedure, Clinton adopted the plant-based whole foods (vegan) diet, which had been recommended by doctors Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn.[272]\n Wealth\n Bill Clinton speaks at Central High School in Phoenix, Arizona, 2016.\n The Clintons accrued several million dollars in legal fees during his presidency; the bills were paid off four years after he left office.[273] Bill and Hillary Clinton have both received millions of dollars in book authorship fees.[274] In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240 million in the 15 years from January 2001 to December 2015 (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing).[275] Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153 million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015.[276] In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25 million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5 million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period.[277] In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5 million and $25.5 million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17 million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president.[278] Clinton earned more than $104 million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012.[279] In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100 million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, the New York Times reported that the Clintons’ income tax returns[280] show they have made $109 million in the 8 years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92 million from his speaking and book-writing.[274][281][282][283]\n Bill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.[276][284][285][286] Hillary Clinton said that she and Bill came out of the White House financially “broke” and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. “We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea’s education.” She added, “Bill has worked really hard … we had to pay off all our debts … he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members.”[282]\n Honors and recognition\n Main article: List of honors and awards received by Bill Clinton\n Secretary of Defense Cohen presents President Clinton the DoD Medal for Distinguished Public Service.\n Bill Clinton statue in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo\n Various colleges and universities have awarded Clinton honorary degrees, including Doctorate of Law degrees[287][288] and Doctor of Humane Letters degrees.[289] He is an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar, although he did not complete his studies there.[290][291] Schools have been named for Clinton,[292][293][294] and statues have been built to pay him homage.[295][296] U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri,[297] Arkansas,[298] Kentucky,[299] and New York.[300] He was presented with the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2001.[301] The Clinton Presidential Center was opened in Little Rock, Arkansas in his honor on December 5, 2001.[302]\n He has been honored in various other ways, in countries that include the Czech Republic,[303] Papua New Guinea,[304] Germany,[305] and Kosovo.[295] The Republic of Kosovo, in gratitude for his help during the Kosovo War, renamed a major street in the capital city of Pristina as Bill Clinton Boulevard and added a monumental Clinton statue.[306][307][308]\n Clinton was selected as Time’s “Man of the Year” in 1992,[309] and again in 1998, along with Ken Starr.[310] From a poll conducted of the American people in December 1999, Clinton was among eighteen included in Gallup’s List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century.[311] He was honored with a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children, a J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding,[312] a TED Prize (named for the confluence of technology, entertainment and design),[313] and was named as an Honorary GLAAD Media Award recipient for his work as an advocate for the LGBT community.[314]\n In 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Clinton with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Cross “for his various initiatives in Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country after the earthquake of January 12, 2010”. Clinton declared at the ceremony that “in the United States of America, I really don’t believe former American presidents need awards anymore, but I am very honored by this one, I love Haiti, and I believe in its promise”.[315]\n U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Clinton the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013.[316]\n Electoral history\n Year Office District Democratic Republican Other\n 1974 Arkansas 3rd congressional district Arkansas Bill Clinton 48.17% John Paul Hammerschmidt 51.83%\n 1976 Arkansas Attorney General Arkansas Bill Clinton Unopposed\n 1978 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 63% Lynn Lowe 37%\n 1980 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 48% Frank White 52%\n 1982 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 55% Frank White 45%\n 1984 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 63% Woody Freeman 37%\n 1986 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 64% Frank White 36%\n 1990 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 57% Sheffield Nelson 42%\n 1992 President of the United States United States of America Bill Clinton 43% George H.

After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married Bill Clinton in 1975. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Rose Law Firm the following year. As First Lady of Arkansas, she led a task force whose recommendations helped reform Arkansas’s public schools.\n As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an advocate for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led to her issuing a statement reaffirming her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female Senator from New York. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.[2]\n As Secretary of State in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013, Clinton responded to the Arab Spring, during which she advocated the U.S. military intervention in Libya. She helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country’s nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Leaving office after Obama’s first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements.\n Clinton made a second presidential run in 2016. She received the most votes and primary delegates in the 2016 Democratic primaries and formally accepted her party’s nomination for President of the United States on July 28, 2016 with vice presidential running mate Senator Tim Kaine. She became the first female candidate to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party. Despite winning the national popular vote, Clinton lost the electoral vote and the presidency to her Republican opponent Donald Trump.[3] Following her loss, in 2017 she stated that she decided to focus on being a self-described “activist citizen”.[4]\n Contents\n  \n Early life\n Museum display case containing photographs, papers, shoes, doll, and other early childhood artifacts of Hillary Rodham’s early life\n Mementos of Hillary Rodham’s early life are shown at the William J. Clinton Presidential Center\n Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.[5][6] Clinton was raised in a United Methodist family that first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge.[7] Her father, Hugh Rodham (1911–1993), was of English and Welsh descent,[8] and managed a small but successful textile business.[9] Her mother, Dorothy Howell (1919–2011), was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent.[8][10][11] Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[12]\n As a child, Rodham was a favorite student of her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge.[13] She participated in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.[13] She has often told a story[14][15][16] of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[17] She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[5][18] She was elected class vice president for her junior year, but then lost for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that “you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president”.[19] For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted “most likely to succeed”. She graduated in her class’s top five percent in 1965.[20]\n Rodham’s mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career,[11] and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter’s abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[21] Raised in a politically conservative household,[11] Rodham helped canvass Chicago’s South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon.[22] She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[23] Rodham’s early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater’s The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago’s Orchestra Hall.[24]\n Wellesley College years\n In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[25][26] During her freshman year, she served as president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[27][28] As the leader of this “Rockefeller Republican”-oriented group,[29] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to Mayor of New York City and Massachusetts Attorney General Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[30] She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the American Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[27] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as “a mind conservative and a heart liberal”.[31] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[32][33]\n By her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[34] In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969.[32][35] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley’s black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[34] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[32][36] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.[32]\n To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference and she attended the “Wellesley in Washington” summer program.[34] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[34] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon’s campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention’s “veiled” racist messages and left the Republican Party for good.[34] Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[37] (Years later, while she was first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[37])\n In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[38] with departmental honors in political science.[37] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke.[35][39] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[32][40][41] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[42][43] due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[39] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet’s nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[44] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).[45]\n Yale Law School and postgraduate studies\n Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she served on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[46] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[47] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48][49] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital[48] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.[47] In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman’s Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale’s Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers’ issues including education, health and housing.[50] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[51] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[52]\n In the late spring of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, who was also a law student at Yale. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);[53] Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[a] Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California;[57] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[54] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.[58] She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[38] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.[59] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[59]\n Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[60] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, “Children Under the Law”, was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[61] Discussing the new children’s rights movement, the article stated that “child citizens” were “powerless individuals”[62] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis.[63] The article became frequently cited in the field.[64]\n Marriage, family, law career and First Lady of Arkansas\n From the East Coast to Arkansas\n During her postgraduate study, Rodham served as staff attorney for Edelman’s newly founded Children’s Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[65] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[66] In 1974 she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., advising the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[67] Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,[48] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for impeachment.[67] The committee’s work culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[67]\n By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham’s career.[68] Wright thought she had the potential to become a future senator or president.[69] Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him and she continued to demur.[70] After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[71] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, “I chose to follow my heart instead of my head”.[72] She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.[73][74]\n Early Arkansas years\n At the university, Rodham gave classes in criminal law, where she was considered to be a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.[75] She became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.[76] In one of her cases, she was mandated by the court to serve as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. Clinton used an effective defense that led her client to plead guilty to a much lesser charge. Decades later, the victim said that the defense counsel had put her “through hell” during the legal process; Hillary Clinton has called the trial a “terrible case”.[77] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city’s first rape crisis center.[76] Rodham still harbored doubts about marriage, concerned that her separate identity would be lost and her accomplishments viewed in the light of someone else’s.[78]\n Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she finally agreed to marry him.[79] Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.[80] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham.[81][82] The motivation was to keep the couple’s professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because, as she told a friend at the time, “it showed that I was still me.”[83] The decision upset both of their more traditional mothers.[84] Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[85] There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[86] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[46] while also working pro bono in child advocacy;[87] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[88]\n Rodham maintained her interest in children’s law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles “Children’s Policies: Abandonment and Neglect” in 1977[89] and “Children’s Rights: A Legal Perspective” in 1979.[90] The latter continued her argument that children’s legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, “Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.”[63] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as “one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades”,[91] while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[92] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[63] and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.[93]\n A small, one-story brick-faced house with a small yard in front. This house is located in Little Rock, Arkansas. Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton lived in this house when Bill was Arkansas Attorney General from 1977 to 1979.\n Rodham and Clinton lived in this house in Little Rock’s Hillcrest neighborhood while he was Arkansas Attorney General (1977–1979).[94]\n In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children’s Defense Fund.[46][95] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[96] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation,[97] and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981.[98] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[b] she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job.[99] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan’s attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[87]\n Following her husband’s November 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state’s First Lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve years (1979–81, 1983–92). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[100] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas’s poorest areas without affecting doctors’ fees.[101]\n In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm.[102] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[103] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[104] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[105] At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[104] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.\n On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to her only child, daughter Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[106]\n Later Arkansas years\n The Reagans and the Clintons walking a red carpet during the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors\n Governor Bill and First Lady Hillary Clinton attend the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors with President Ronald and First Lady Nancy Reagan.\n Bill Clinton returned to the governor’s office two years later after winning the election of 1982. During her husband’s campaign, Hillary began to use the name “Hillary Clinton”, or sometimes “Mrs. Bill Clinton”, to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.[107] As First Lady of Arkansas again, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[c] She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state’s court-sanctioned public education system.[113][114] In one of the Clinton governorship’s most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[100][113] It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[82][113] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas’s Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[115] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[116][117]\n Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was First Lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours,[118] but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[119] The firm considered her a “rainmaker” because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[119] Bill Clinton’s Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest, because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[120]\n From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[121] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[122] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it.[123] She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 and in 1991.[124] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final time.[125]\n Formal color portrait of Clinton, 1992\n Clinton in 1992\n Clinton served as Chairman of the Board of the Children’s Defense Fund[5][126] and on the board of the Arkansas Children’s Hospital’s Legal Services (1988–92)[127] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–92),[128] Wal-Mart Stores (1986–92)[129] and Lafarge (1990–92).[130] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[119][131] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart’s board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[131] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be added to the company’s management and was silent about the company’s famously anti-labor union practices.[129][131][132]\n Bill Clinton presidential campaign of 1992\n Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[133] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged “causing pain in my marriage”.[134] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[135] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette’s outlook on marriage as described in her classic song “Stand by Your Man”,[d] and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would “get two for the price of one”, referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[141] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg’s August 1992 The American Spectator article “The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock”, Hillary’s own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[92] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[142]\n First Lady of the United States\n When Bill Clinton took office as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press secretary reiterated that she would be using that form of her name.[c] She was the first inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[143] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[60][144] She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[145] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[146][147]\n Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton’s role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband’s presidency.[148] Bill Clinton’s campaign promise of “two for the price of one” led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as “co-presidents” or sometimes use the Arkansas label “Billary”.[100][149][150] The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into “imaginary discussions” with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt.[f] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.[154][155] Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner’s “politics of meaning” to overcome what she saw as America’s “sleeping sickness of the soul”; that would lead to a willingness “to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium.”[156][157]\n Health care and other policy initiatives\n See also: Clinton health care plan of 1993\n Clinton at a presentation on her health care plan in September 1993\n In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[158] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[159][160] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as “Hillarycare” and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress.[161] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[161]\n Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[162] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady’s approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44 percent in April 1994 and 35 percent by September 1994.[163]\n Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections.[164] Republicans saw a net gain of fifty-three seats in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats’ defeat, especially among independent voters.[165] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton’s role in shaping policy.[166] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use “Hillarycare” as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[167]\n Clinton reads a book to an African-American grade-schooler in Maryland during Read Across America Day in 1998\n Clinton reads to a Maryland child during Read Across America Day, 1998\n Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.[168] She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare.[169] She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.[60]\n Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton’s presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming off welfare, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.[170][171] A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again.[170] But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.[170][171] This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called “sad and painful”.[171]\n Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.[60] In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as first lady.[60][172] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care.[172] As first lady, Clinton was the host for various White House conferences, including ones on Child Care (1997),[173] on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997),[174] and on Children and Adolescents (2000).[175] She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000)[176] and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999).[177]\n Clinton traveled to 79 countries during this time,[178] breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon.[179] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[180] A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan.[181] Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps.[182] The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.[183]\n File:First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton’s Remarks to the Fourth Women’s Conference in Beijing, China.webmPlay media\n Clinton delivering her “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights” speech in Beijing in September 1995 (20:19)\n In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued very forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People’s Republic of China itself, declaring that “it is no longer acceptable to discuss women’s rights as separate from human rights”.[184] Delegates from over 180 countries heard her say: “If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights, once and for all.”[185] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[178][185] The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton’s key phrases.[186] She was one of the most prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[187][188] She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.[189] It and Clinton’s own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.[190]\n Whitewater and other investigations\n For more details on these investigations, see Whitewater controversy, Travelgate, Filegate, and Hillary Clinton cattle futures controversy.\n First Lady Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress and the press.\n The Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign[191] and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm[192] and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton’s work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed.[191] She said she had done minimal work for the bank.[193] Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton’s legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.[194][195] The records were found in the First Lady’s White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996.[195] The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been.[195] Clinton’s staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion.[196] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[194] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[197]\n Chelsea, Bill, and Hillary Clinton take an inauguration day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 1997, when Bill started a second term as President.\n The Clintons take an Inauguration Day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to start Bill’s second term as President, January 20, 1997\n Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an affair that became known as “Travelgate”, began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.[198] The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.[199][200] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made “factually false” statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false, or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.[201]\n In March 1994, newspaper reports revealed her spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978–79.[202] Allegations were made in the press of conflict of interest and disguised bribery and several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.[203]\n An outgrowth of the “Travelgate” investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called “Filegate”.[204] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and that she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[205] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[204]\n There was a controversy that arose in early 2001 over gifts made to the White House, rather than to the Clintons personally, that were removed and shipped to the Clintons’ private residence during the last year of Bill Clinton’s time in office.[206][207]\n Response to Lewinsky scandal\n Further information: Lewinsky scandal\n In 1998, the Clintons’ relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had engaged in an extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[208] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the President by the House of Representatives and later acquittal by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a “vast right-wing conspiracy”,[209][210] characterizing the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill’s political enemies[g] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said that she had been misled by her husband’s initial claims that no affair had taken place.[212] After the evidence of President Clinton’s encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage, but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage.[213] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.[214]\n Public reaction varied. Some women admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public, some sympathized with her as a victim of her husband’s insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an enabler to her husband’s indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.[215] Her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around 70 percent, the highest they had ever been.[215] In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to “a love that has persisted for decades” and add: “No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.”[216]\n Issues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills; in 2014, Hillary would state that she and Bill had left the White House “not only dead broke, but in debt.” The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who gave paid speeches after leaving office as well as the couple’s ability to secure loans from banks.[217]\n Traditional duties\n Clinton initiated and was the founding chair of Save America’s Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations in order to preserve and restore historic items and sites,[218] including the flag that inspired “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the First Ladies Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[60] She was head of the White House Millennium Council[219] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[220] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[60] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned from museums.[221]\n In the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the state rooms.[60] She oversaw the restoration of the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe[222] and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II.[223] Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter.[224] These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines.[223] Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.[224] Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year’s Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[60]\n United States Senate\n Main article: United States Senate career of Hillary Clinton\n 2000 U.S. Senate election\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2000\n When New York’s long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan’s open seat in the Senate election of 2000.[225] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.[226] She became the first First Lady of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.[227] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York’s 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state’s politics before the 2000 Senate race.[228]\n Clinton began her campaign, which was managed by Bill de Blasio, by visiting all 62 counties in the State, in a “listening tour” of small-group settings.[229] She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000 jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.[230]\n The contest drew national attention. Lazio blundered during a September debate by seeming to invade Clinton’s personal space trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.[231] The campaigns of Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani’s initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million.[232] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55 percent of the vote to Lazio’s 43 percent.[231] She was sworn in as U.S. Senator on January 3, 2001,[233] making her the first (and so far only) woman to have held an elected office either while,[h] or after, serving as first lady.\n First term\n Clinton being sworn in as U.S. Senator by Vice President Al Gore in 2000.

Working with New York’s senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center site’s redevelopment.[241] She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.[242] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties,[243] before voting in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 in March 2006 that gained large majority support.[244]\n Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[245] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[246]\n After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[247] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain.[248] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush’s pledge to stay “until the job is done” was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis “an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves”.[249] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.[250] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York.[251][252] She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers.[252] (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying that she “got it wrong” and the vote in support had been a “mistake”.[253])\n Clinton voted against President Bush’s two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[254] Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[255][256]\n In 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[257] Along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[254][258]\n Looking to establish a “progressive infrastructure” to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration Chief of Staff John Podesta’s Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons’ former antagonist David Brock’s Media Matters for America, created in 2004.[259] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.[260]\n 2006 re-election campaign\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2006\n In November 2004, Clinton announced that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[261] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance.[262] Clinton’s eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67 percent of the vote to Spencer’s 31 percent,[263] carrying all but four of New York’s sixty-two counties.[264] Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.[265] In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.[266]\n Second term\n Clinton listens as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee.

A man wearing a black suit sits behind Clinton, taking notes.\n Clinton listens as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee\n Clinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging that the surge had been successful).[i] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines[268] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[269] Clinton responded to General David Petraeus’s September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, “I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.”[270]\n In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[271] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[272]\n As the financial crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700 billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying that it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74–25.[273]\n In 2007, Clinton and Virginia Senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[274]\n 2008 presidential campaign\n Main articles: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008 and Hillary Clinton presidential primary campaign, 2008\n Clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. President since at least early 2003.[275] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating “I’m in and I’m in to win.”[276] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency and no First Lady had ever run for President. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed that the couple’s worth was now upwards of $50 million,[277] and that they had earned over $100 million since 2000, with most of it coming from Bill’s books, speaking engagements and other activities.[278]\n  \n Clinton addresses the 2007 CDA National Convention\n Throughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[246] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[246] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[279] At the end of October, Clinton suffered a poor debate performance against Obama, Edwards and her other opponents.[280][281] Obama’s message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton’s message of experience.[282]\n Clinton speaking at a college rally as part of her 2008 Presidential campaign, with a crowd behind her looking on.

Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[288] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[j] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[289] Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[288][290] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[290] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February 5 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former President “needs to stop”.[291] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Hillary Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[292]\n Chart of 50 states, showing state-by-state popular votes in the Democratic primaries and caucuses, shaded by percentage won.

(Popular vote winners and delegate winners differed in New Hampshire, Nevada, Missouri, Texas and Guam.)\n On Super Tuesday, Clinton won the largest states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states;[293] they almost evenly split the total popular vote.[294] But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.[295]\n The Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign.[282][296] There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff and she made several top-level personnel changes.[296][297] Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton.[295][296] On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places,[296] where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband’s presidency, helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular.[298] Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation.[282][295] Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated.[299][300] Behind in delegates, Clinton’s best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.[301]\n Clinton speaking on behalf of Barack Obama before a convention audience during the second night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. Multiple audience members in the foreground wave white flags with the word “Hillary” written in marker.\n Clinton speaks on behalf of her former rival, Barack Obama, during the second night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver\n Following the final primaries on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee.[302] In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[303] By campaign’s end, Clinton had won 1,640 pledged delegates to Obama’s 1,763;[304] at the time of the clinching, Clinton had 286 superdelegates to Obama’s 395,[305] with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner.[304] Clinton and Obama each received over 17 million votes during the nomination process[k] with both breaking the previous record.[306] Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm’s 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman.[286] Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4.[307] Clinton’s campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13 million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.[308]\n U.S. Secretary of State\n Main article: Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State\n See also: Foreign policy of Barack Obama\n Nomination and confirmation\n Hillary Clinton taking oath as Secretary of State on January 21, 2009.

Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.[314]\n The appointment required a Saxbe fix, passed and signed into law in December 2008.[315] Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before the Obama inauguration; two days later, the Committee voted 16–1 to approve Clinton.[316] By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65 percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal.[317] On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94–2.[318] Clinton took the oath of office of Secretary of State, resigning from the Senate later that day.[319] She became the first former first lady to serve in the United States Cabinet.[320]\n First half of tenure\n Obama whispering to Clinton at a summit meeting, with multiple soldiers in uniform standing behind them and heads of state sitting behind and in front of them. They are in the 21st NATO summit, which was held in April 2009.\n Obama and Clinton confer at the 21st NATO summit, April 2009\n Clinton spent her initial days as Secretary of State telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U.S. foreign policy would change direction: “We have a lot of damage to repair.”[321] She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions.[322] Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes specific objectives for the State Department’s diplomatic missions abroad; it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee.[323] The first such review was issued in late 2010 and called for the U.S. leading through “civilian power” as a cost-effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises.[324] It also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world.[185] A cause Clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women.[310]\n Hillary Clinton standing with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Both of them are holding a “reset button”. They are in a room with a window to the left and an American flag behind them\n Clinton with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the “reset button”, March 2009\n In an internal debate regarding the war in Afghanistan during 2009, Clinton sided with the military’s recommendations for a maximal “Afghanistan surge”, recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal; she prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden’s opposition, but eventually supported Obama’s compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.[252][325] In March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a “reset button” symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[326][327] The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev’s time in office, but relations would worsen considerably following Vladimir Putin’s return to the position in 2012.[326] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton’s intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish–Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[328][329] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[183][l] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country’s nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[310][331][332]\n Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president.[333][334] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[335] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[310] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[334] moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon.[336][337] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.[310]\n Clinton greeting U.S. military personnel at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. The personnel are wearing uniforms and standing side-by-side.\n Clinton greets service members at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, October 2010\n In a prepared speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet.[338] Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it and the speech garnered attention as the first time a senior American official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy.[339] In July 2010, she visited Korea, Vietnam, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all the while preparing for the July 31 wedding of daughter Chelsea amid much media attention.[340]\n Second half of tenure\n The 2011 Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis for the administration yet.[341] Clinton’s public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was “stable”, to a stance that there needed to be an “orderly transition [to] a democratic participatory government”, to a condemnation of violence against the protesters.[342][343] Obama came to rely upon Clinton’s advice, organization and personal connections in the behind-the-scenes response to developments.[341] As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region, Clinton was at the forefront of a U.S. response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory, backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others.[344]\n Hillary Clinton speaks at a London meeting to discuss NATO military intervention in Libya on March 29, 2011. She is standing behind a blue podium with a sign that has the words “THE LONDON CONFERENCE ON LIBYA” printed in white-on-blue text in capital letters.\n The London meeting to discuss NATO military intervention in Libya, March 29, 2011\n As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton’s shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[344][345][346] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution and the State Department’s legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution’s 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[347] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called “convening power” to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[345] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state,[348] and the wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[349][350][351]\n During April 2011 internal deliberations of the president’s innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[352][353] Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden’s death, Clinton played a key role in the administration’s decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[354] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).[252][355]\n Clinton standing with Aung San Suu Kyi. The two women are discussing something during Clinton’s 2011 visit to Burma.\n Clinton meeting with Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi as part of her historic December 2011 visit to that country\n In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that “Gay rights are human rights” and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad.[356] The same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary of state since 1955, as she met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms.[357][358] She also said that the 21st century would be “America’s Pacific century”,[359] a declaration that was part of the Obama administration’s “pivot to Asia”.[360]\n During the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama administration initially sought to persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform, then as government violence allegedly rose in August 2011, called for him to resign from the presidency.[361] The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria.[362] During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels, but the proposal was rejected by the White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict and who feared that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.[357][363]\n In December 2012 Clinton was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus.[364] Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe.[364][365] The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.[365][366][m]\n Overall themes\n President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on Operation Neptune’s Spear, a mission against Osama bin Laden, in one of the conference rooms of the Situation Room of the White House, on May 1, 2011.

Several of the attendees are sitting down, while others stand behind them. Everyone in the room is watching a live feed from drones operating over the Osama bin Laden complex.\n Throughout her time in office and in her final speech concluding it, Clinton viewed “smart power” as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values—in a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities—by combining military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy.[345][370] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.[371] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[252][335][355] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[372]\n Clinton greatly expanded the State Department’s use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, both to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-à-vis their governments.[345] And in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[185] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the “Hillary Doctrine”, she viewed women’s rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[333][373] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.[374]\n Clinton visited 112 countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[375][n] (Time magazine wrote that “Clinton’s endurance is legendary”).[345] The first secretary of state to visit countries such as Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[378] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as Secretary of State should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[346] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton’s successor.[365] Her last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013.[379] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton’s tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other Secretaries of State had,[336][337] and highlighted her focus on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.[380]\n Benghazi attack and subsequent hearings\n See also: 2012 Benghazi attack and United States House Select Committee on Benghazi\n Obama and Clinton at a somber occasion, honoring the Benghazi attack victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony, held at Andrews Air Force Base on September 14, 2012. There are soldiers standing behind Obama and Clinton, and everyone is standing on a large wooden floor with their left hands to their side and their right hands on their upper chests.\n Obama and Clinton honor the Benghazi attack victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony, held at Andrews Air Force Base on September 14, 2012\n On September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[381] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[381][382]\n On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[383] It focused its criticism on the department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[384] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[383]\n Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[385] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate “talking points” after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, “With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.”[385][386] In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration’s response to the attack.[387]\n Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015. She is standing behind a podium with a microphone, with many people behind her.\n Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015\n The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack.[388] Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics.[388][389] This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton’s poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans’ previous talking points on the investigation.[388][390] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[391][392] The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves.[391] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[393] The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines,[388] with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.[389]\n Email controversy\n Main article: Hillary Clinton email controversy\n A controversy arose in March 2015, when it was revealed by the State Department’s inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton’s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[394][395]\n In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and “never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.” They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[396] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[397] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called “born classified” category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[398] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton’s server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[399] Additionally, the intelligence community’s inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails “contained classified State Department information when originated.”[400] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[401]\n Clinton maintained that she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, “I never sent or received any classified material – they are retroactively classifying it.” On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: “Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.”[402][403]\n On July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said:\n 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were “up-classified” to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[399][404]\n Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small “c” in parentheses, described as “portion markings” by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not “technically sophisticated” enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.[404] The probe found that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI assessed that it “is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account.” Comey stated that although Clinton or her colleagues were “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information”, the FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that “no charges are appropriate in this case.”[399] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed that the probe into Clinton’s use of private email servers while secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges.[405]\n On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI started looking into newly discovered emails. Law enforcement officials stated while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered e-mails related to Clinton’s private server on a laptop computer belonging to Anthony Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its conclusion reached in July.[406] The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election.[407]\n Clinton Foundation and speeches\n Main article: Clinton Foundation\n Clinton standing behind lectern\n Clinton in September 2014\n When Clinton left the State Department, she became a private citizen for the first time in thirty years.[408] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[409] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[409][410]\n Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[411] its March 2015 report said that while “There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman … this data shows just how far we still have to go.”[412] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary.[o] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[415]\n She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[416] There she received $200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[416][417] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[416] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11 million from her speeches.[418] For the overall period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141 million, paid some $56 million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15 million to charity.[419] As of 2015, she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her own, or $45–53 million with her husband.[420]\n Clinton resigned from the foundation’s board in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign and the foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[o]\n 2016 presidential campaign\n  \n Clinton campaigning for president in Manchester, New Hampshire, in October 2016, with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (seated)\n Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016\n Further information: United States presidential election, 2016; Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016; and Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016\n On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[421] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure.[422] The campaign’s headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[423] Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act.[424][425] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[421] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton’s Wall Street ties.[417][425]\n In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders,[426][427] making her the first woman to win the Iowa caucuses.[426] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[428] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[429] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[430] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[429] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[429]\n On March 1 (“Super Tuesday”), Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[431] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[432][433][434]\n By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[435] On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[436] By campaign’s end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders’ 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders’ 47.[437] She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders’ 13 million.[438]\n  \n Bernie Sanders endorsing Clinton in New Hampshire, July 2016\n Clinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.[439] Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following day.[440] Her opponents in the general election were Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party.\n Clinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton became tied in major polls following the FBI’s conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[441] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her handling of classified government material.[442] In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention, in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it is toward the small side by historical standards.[443][444] Following Clinton’s 7 percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[445][446]\n Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016 presidential election.[447] By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win and media sources proclaimed him the winner.[448] Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave a victory speech.[449] The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying “We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.”[450] Though Clinton lost the election by only capturing 232 electors to Trump’s 306, a month after the election the popular vote count showed her leading by more than 2.7 million votes, with many votes yet to be counted.[451] She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.[452][453]\n On December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes instead being cast for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.[454]\n Clinton speaking behind a podium with a microphone in her hand.

The morning of the inauguration Clinton wrote on her Twitter account, “I’m here today to honor our democracy &amp; its enduring values, I will never stop believing in our country &amp; its future.”[455]\n On March 17, 2017 Clinton delivered a St. Patrick’s Day speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Making reference to reports of her being seen taking walks in woods around Chappaqua following her loss in the presidential election,[456][457] Clinton indicated her readiness to emerge from “the woods” and become politically active again.[456]\n In April 2017, Clinton commented that she will not seek public office again.[458]\n Clinton revealed Onward Together, a new political action committee that she wrote as being “dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election”, in a several tweets and an email in May 2017.[459]\n In a June 5, 2017 appearance at the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel, Clinton condemned the 2017 Portland train attack: “When violence motivated by hatred from, Portland, Oregon, to College Park, ends the lives of young Americans, this program’s mission of spreading tolerance is more urgent than ever.”[460] On June 14, after the Congressional baseball shooting, Clinton tweeted, “2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we’re all ultimately on one team. My thoughts are with the members of Congress, staff &amp; heroic police.”[461]\n Comments on President Trump\n On February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indians by Adam Purinton.[462] On April 6, in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Clinton said the US should take out the air fields of Bashar al-Assad and thereby “prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.”[463] On May 2, Clinton said Trump’s use of Twitter “doesn’t work” when pursuing important negotiations and North Korea should not be consulted with an abandoning “of a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table with some kind of realistic prospect for change.”[464] While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump’s 2018 budget proposal was “a con” for underfunding domestic programs.[465] During an appearance at Recode’s Code Conference on May 31, Clinton suggested Trump’s incomplete tweet from earlier in the day was “a hidden message to the Russians.”[466] The following day, after President Trump announced withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a “historic mistake.”[467]\n On March 24, 2017, after the postponing of a Congressional vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Clinton labeled the day “a victory for the 24,000,000 people at risk of losing their health insurance” and warned of an ongoing battle to maintain coverage.[468] Clinton went on to call the American Health Care Act “a disastrous bill” during a San Francisco speech four days later.[469] May 4, after the House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act, Clinton dubbed it a “shameful failure of policy &amp; morality by GOP”.[470] On June 23, the day after Senate Republicans revealed a draft of their healthcare reform legislation, Clinton tweeted, “This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics. Speak out against this bill.”[471]\n Political positions\n Main article: Political positions of Hillary Clinton\n Secretary of State Clinton meets with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Clinton is in favor of maintaining U.S. influence in the Middle East.\n Several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton’s place on the political spectrum scientifically using her Senate votes. National Journal’s 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[472] National Journal’s subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[473] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her to be likely the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[474] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75 liberal, 23 conservative; Social = 83 liberal, 6 conservative; Foreign = 66 liberal, 30 conservative. Total average = 75 liberal, 20 conservative.[p] According to FiveThirtyEight’s measure of political ideology, “Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.”[475]\n Organizations have also attempted to give newer assessments of Clinton once she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in their “Left Liberal” region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances and an economic score of 10 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[476] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[477] Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90 percent “Liberal Quotient” from Americans for Democratic Action,[478] and a lifetime 8 percent rating from the American Conservative Union.[479]\n In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called “optimistic” and “wide-ranging”. Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a “clawback” that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an “exit tax” on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[480] Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as “the gold standard”[481] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that “any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security”.[482][483] As Senator (2001–2009), her record on trade was mixed, voting in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[482]\n Given the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit “unaccountable money” in politics.[484] In July 2016, she “committed” to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.[485][486] On December 7, 2015, in The New York Times, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities.[487]\n Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign logo, a large blue letter “H” with a red arrow facing right, overlaying the horizontal bar of the “H”. The head of the arrow is also overlaid over the right vertical bar of the “H”, with two small blue triangles poking out where the bar of the “H” is not covered by the arrow.\n Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign logo\n Clinton accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, supports cap-and-trade,[488] and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline.[489]\n She supported “equal pay for equal work,” to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do.[490] Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool.[484] These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a “fair share surcharge”.[491]\n Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act[492] and would have added a “public option” that would have competed against private insurers and enabled people “50 or 55 and up” to buy into Medicare.[493][494]\n On LGBT rights, she supported the right to same-sex marriage.[484] Clinton first expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage in 2013; in 2000, she had been against such unions altogether and in 2006, she said only that she would support a state’s decision to permit same-sex marriages.[495] In 2000, she was the first First Lady to march in an LGBT pride parade.[496] In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).[497]\n Clinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship “[i]s at its heart a family issue”,[498] and expressed support for Obama’s Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States.[499][500] She opposed and criticized Trump’s call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[501]\n Clinton expressed support for Common Core.[502] She said, “The really unfortunate argument that’s been going on around Common Core, it’s very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn’t politicized…. Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven’t had that and so don’t understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.”[503]\n On foreign affairs, Clinton voted in October 2002 in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq,[504] a vote she later “regretted.”[505] She favored arming Syria’s rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[506] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[507][508] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[501] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, “America can’t ever be neutral when it comes to Israel’s security and survival.”[509] Clinton expressed support for Israel’s right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[510][511] In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields.[512]\n In 2000, Clinton advocated for eliminating the electoral college[513] and promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it resulting in the direct election of the president.[514][515]\n Religious views\n Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church:\n First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge, Illinois—in her early life,\n First United Methodist Church of Little Rock, Arkansas—while in Arkansas,\n Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C.—as First Lady of the United States,\n Metropolitan Community United Methodist Church in New York, New York—currently a congregant.\n She discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.[516] However, she has infrequently discussed her faith while campaigning.[517][518] Clinton has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one’s neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and “creating opportunities for others to be lifted up”.[518] Clinton has also expressed disappointment that “Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.”[518]\n Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has suggested that Clinton’s political positions are rooted in her faith. Clinton often expresses a certain maxim which is often attributed to John Wesley: “Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.”[517] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy “made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith.”[519]\n Writings and recordings\n See also: Bibliography of Hillary Clinton\n External video\n Booknotes interview with Clinton about It Takes a Village, March 3, 1996, C-SPAN\n Informal pose of Clinton, in which she is wearing a beige wool jacket and facing toward the right.

The book made the Best Seller list of The New York Times and Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book’s audio recording.[522] She was the first First Lady to win a Grammy Award.[523]\n Other books published by Clinton when she was first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids’ Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children’s book Beatrice’s Goat.[524]\n In 2003, Clinton released a 562-page autobiography, Living History, for which publisher Simon &amp; Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8 million.[525] The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[526] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[527] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[528] Clinton’s audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[529]\n In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as Secretary of State. As of July 2015, the book has sold about 280,000 copies.[530]\n In 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States if they had won the 2016 presidential election.[531]\n Clinton authored her third memoir, What Happened, about the 2016 election, which was released on September 12, 2017, by Simon &amp; Schuster, in print, e-book, and audio read by the author.[532] A book tour and series of interviews and personal appearances were arranged for the launch.[533]\n Cultural and political image\n Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton, from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found “a virtual cottage industry” of “anti-Clinton literature”, put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints, with titles such as Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary’s Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton’s Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless … Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[534] (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[535] Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable “bogeyman” to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[536]\n Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture from a wide spectrum of varying perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[537] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, “Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.”[538] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as first lady and has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers.[539][540] Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her, including but not limited to “The Hillary Shimmy Song”, which went viral.[541][542][543][544]\n A three-story, red brick building in Arkansas. The Rose Law Firm is located inside this building. Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years.\n Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years. Her professional career and political involvement set the stage for public reaction to her as first lady.\n Clinton has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, with some arguing otherwise.[545] James Madison University political science professor Valerie Sulfaro’s 2007 study used the American National Election Studies’ “feeling thermometer” polls, which measure the degree of opinion about a political figure, to find that such polls during Clinton’s first lady years confirm the “conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure”, with the added insight that “affect towards Mrs. Clinton as first lady tended to be very positive or very negative, with a fairly constant one fourth of respondents feeling ambivalent or neutral”.[546] University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson’s 2006 study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state’s senators, Clinton had the fourth-largest partisan difference of any senator, with a 50-percentage-point difference in approval between New York’s Democrats and Republicans.[547]\n Northern Illinois University political science professor Barbara Burrell’s 2000 study found that Clinton’s Gallup poll favorability numbers broke sharply along partisan lines throughout her time as first lady, with 70 to 90 percent of Democrats typically viewing her favorably while only 20 to 40 percent of Republicans did.[548] University of Wisconsin–Madison political science professor Charles Franklin analyzed her record of favorable versus unfavorable ratings in public opinion polls and found that there was more variation in them during her first lady years than her Senate years. The Senate years showed favorable ratings around 50 percent and unfavorable ratings in the mid-40 percent range; Franklin noted that, “This sharp split is, of course, one of the more widely remarked aspects of Sen. Clinton’s public image.”[549] McGill University professor of history Gil Troy titled his 2006 biography of her Hillary Rodham Clinton: Polarizing First Lady and wrote that after the 1992 campaign, Clinton “was a polarizing figure, with 42 percent [of the public] saying she came closer to their values and lifestyle than previous first ladies and 41 percent disagreeing.”[550] Troy further wrote that Clinton “has been uniquely controversial and contradictory since she first appeared on the national radar screen in 1992” and that she “has alternately fascinated, bedeviled, bewitched and appalled Americans.”[551]\n Line chart showing Clinton’s favorability rankings from 1992 to 2016. The ratings show her as a controversial first lady whose ratings hit a low following the Hillarycare failure and a high following the Lewinsky scandal. Opinion about her was closely divided during her 2000 Senate campaign, mildly positive during her time as a senator, and then closely divided again during her 2008 presidential campaign. As secretary of state, she enjoyed widespread approval, before dipping as her tenure ended and then to some of her lowest ratings ever as she became viewed as a presidential candidate again.\n Clinton’s Gallup Poll favorable and unfavorable ratings, 1992–2016.[552]\n The ratings show her as a controversial first lady whose ratings hit a low following the Hillarycare failure and a high following the Lewinsky scandal.

As secretary of state, she enjoyed widespread approval, before dipping as her tenure ended and then to some of her lowest ratings ever as she became viewed as a presidential candidate again.[553]\n Burrell’s study found women consistently rating Clinton more favorably than men by about ten percentage points during her first lady years.[548] Jacobson’s study found a positive correlation across all senators between being women and receiving a partisan-polarized response.[547] Colorado State University communication studies professor Karrin Vasby Anderson describes the first lady position as a “site” for American womanhood, one ready made for the symbolic negotiation of female identity.[554] In particular anderson states there has been a cultural bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against modern first ladies; by the time of Clinton, the first lady position had become a site of heterogeneity and paradox.[554] Burrell, as well as biographers Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., note that Clinton achieved her highest approval ratings as first lady late in 1998, not for professional or political achievements of her own, but for being seen as the victim of her husband’s very public infidelity.[215][548] University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson saw Clinton as an exemplar of the double bind, who though able to live in a “both-and” world of both career and family, nevertheless “became a surrogate on whom we projected our attitudes about attributes once thought incompatible”, leading to her being placed in a variety of no-win situations.[538] Quinnipiac University media studies professor Lisa Burns found press accounts frequently framing Clinton both as an exemplar of the modern professional working mother and as a political interloper interested in usurping power for herself.[555] University of Indianapolis English professor Charlotte Templin found political cartoonists using a variety of stereotypes—such as gender reversal, radical feminist as emasculator and the wife the husband wants to get rid of—to portray Clinton as violating gender norms.[556]\n Side profile of Clinton facing toward her right side. She is speaking into a microphone.\n Clinton in 2009\n Going into the early stages of her presidential campaign for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled “Love Her”, “Hate Her”,[557] while Mother Jones titled its profile of her “Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary”.[558] Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates,[559] while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all.[560][561] An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled “The Waning Power of Hillary Hate”.[562] By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation.[563] She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton’s laugh,[564] that “We know that there’s language to condemn female speech that doesn’t exist for male speech. We call women’s speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton’s laugh was being described as a cackle.”[563] The “bitch” epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics,[565] flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well.[566] Following Clinton’s “choked up moment” and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender’s role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[567][568] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events “brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades … she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics.”[568]\n Hillary Clinton dressed in a black suit and a green shirt, sitting in a café.

It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics.[572] Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, “There’s a certain consistency to who I am and what I do and I think people have finally said, ‘Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'”[333] She continued to do well in Gallup’s most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.[573]\n Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[574] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[575] During 2016 she acknowledged that: “I’m not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed.”[576] In July 2017 Bloomberg showed her approval rating at 39 percent.[577]\n Electoral history\n Main article: Electoral history of Hillary Clinton\n New York United States Senate election, 2000\n Party Candidate Votes % ±\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 3,747,310 55.3\n Republican Rick Lazio 2,915,730 43.0\n New York United States Senate election, 2006\n Party Candidate Votes % ±\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 3,008,428 67.0 +11.7\n Republican John Spencer 1,392,189 31.0 −12.0\n Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008\n Party Candidate Votes %\n Democratic Barack Obama 17,584,692 (popular votes)\n 2,272.5 delegates\n (33 states) 47.3% of popular vote\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 17,857,501 (popular votes)\n 1,978 delegates\n (23 states) 48.0% of popular vote\n Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016\n Party Candidate Votes %\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 16,914,722 (popular votes)\n 2,842 delegates\n (34 states) 55.2% of popular vote\n Democratic Bernie Sanders 13,206,428 (popular votes)\n 1,865 delegates\n (23 states) 43.1% of popular vote\n United States presidential election, 2016\n Party Candidate Votes %\n Republican Donald Trump 62,979,879 (popular votes)\n 304 electors\n (30 states + ME-02) 46.0% (popular vote)\n 56.5% (electoral vote)\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 65,844,954 (popular votes)\n 227 electors\n (20 states + DC) 48.1% (popular vote)\n 42.2% (electoral vote)\n Early life\n Museum display case containing photographs, papers, shoes, doll, and other early childhood artifacts of Hillary Rodham’s early life\n Mementos of Hillary Rodham’s early life are shown at the William J. Clinton Presidential Center\n Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.[5][6] Clinton was raised in a United Methodist family that first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge.[7] Her father, Hugh Rodham (1911–1993), was of English and Welsh descent,[8] and managed a small but successful textile business.[9] Her mother, Dorothy Howell (1919–2011), was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent.[8][10][11] Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[12]\n As a child, Rodham was a favorite student of her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge.[13] She participated in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.[13] She has often told a story[14][15][16] of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[17] She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[5][18] She was elected class vice president for her junior year, but then lost for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that “you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president”.[19] For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted “most likely to succeed”. She graduated in her class’s top five percent in 1965.[20]\n Rodham’s mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career,[11] and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter’s abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[21] Raised in a politically conservative household,[11] Rodham helped canvass Chicago’s South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon.[22] She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[23] Rodham’s early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater’s The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago’s Orchestra Hall.[24]\n Wellesley College years\n In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[25][26] During her freshman year, she served as president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[27][28] As the leader of this “Rockefeller Republican”-oriented group,[29] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to Mayor of New York City and Massachusetts Attorney General Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[30] She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the American Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[27] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as “a mind conservative and a heart liberal”.[31] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[32][33]\n By her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[34] In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969.[32][35] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley’s black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[34] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[32][36] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.[32]\n To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference and she attended the “Wellesley in Washington” summer program.[34] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[34] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon’s campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention’s “veiled” racist messages and left the Republican Party for good.[34] Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[37] (Years later, while she was first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[37])\n In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[38] with departmental honors in political science.[37] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke.[35][39] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[32][40][41] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[42][43] due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[39] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet’s nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[44] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).[45]\n Yale Law School and postgraduate studies\n Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she served on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[46] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[47] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48][49] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital[48] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.[47] In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman’s Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale’s Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers’ issues including education, health and housing.[50] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[51] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[52]\n In the late spring of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, who was also a law student at Yale. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);[53] Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[a] Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California;[57] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[54] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.[58] She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[38] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.[59] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[59]\n Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[60] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, “Children Under the Law”, was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[61] Discussing the new children’s rights movement, the article stated that “child citizens” were “powerless individuals”[62] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis.[63] The article became frequently cited in the field.[64]\n Marriage, family, law career and First Lady of Arkansas\n From the East Coast to Arkansas\n During her postgraduate study, Rodham served as staff attorney for Edelman’s newly founded Children’s Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[65] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[66] In 1974 she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., advising the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[67] Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,[48] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for impeachment.[67] The committee’s work culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[67]\n By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham’s career.[68] Wright thought she had the potential to become a future senator or president.[69] Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him and she continued to demur.[70] After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[71] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, “I chose to follow my heart instead of my head”.[72] She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.[73][74]\n Early Arkansas years\n At the university, Rodham gave classes in criminal law, where she was considered to be a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.[75] She became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.[76] In one of her cases, she was mandated by the court to serve as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. Clinton used an effective defense that led her client to plead guilty to a much lesser charge. Decades later, the victim said that the defense counsel had put her “through hell” during the legal process; Hillary Clinton has called the trial a “terrible case”.[77] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city’s first rape crisis center.[76] Rodham still harbored doubts about marriage, concerned that her separate identity would be lost and her accomplishments viewed in the light of someone else’s.[78]\n Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she finally agreed to marry him.[79] Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.[80] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham.[81][82] The motivation was to keep the couple’s professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because, as she told a friend at the time, “it showed that I was still me.”[83] The decision upset both of their more traditional mothers.[84] Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[85] There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[86] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[46] while also working pro bono in child advocacy;[87] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[88]\n Rodham maintained her interest in children’s law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles “Children’s Policies: Abandonment and Neglect” in 1977[89] and “Children’s Rights: A Legal Perspective” in 1979.[90] The latter continued her argument that children’s legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, “Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.”[63] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as “one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades”,[91] while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[92] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[63] and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.[93]\n A small, one-story brick-faced house with a small yard in front. This house is located in Little Rock, Arkansas. Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton lived in this house when Bill was Arkansas Attorney General from 1977 to 1979.\n Rodham and Clinton lived in this house in Little Rock’s Hillcrest neighborhood while he was Arkansas Attorney General (1977–1979).[94]\n In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children’s Defense Fund.[46][95] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[96] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation,[97] and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981.[98] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[b] she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job.[99] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan’s attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[87]\n Following her husband’s November 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state’s First Lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve years (1979–81, 1983–92). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[100] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas’s poorest areas without affecting doctors’ fees.[101]\n In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm.[102] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[103] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[104] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[105] At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[104] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.\n On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to her only child, daughter Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[106]\n Later Arkansas years\n The Reagans and the Clintons walking a red carpet during the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors\n Governor Bill and First Lady Hillary Clinton attend the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors with President Ronald and First Lady Nancy Reagan.\n Bill Clinton returned to the governor’s office two years later after winning the election of 1982. During her husband’s campaign, Hillary began to use the name “Hillary Clinton”, or sometimes “Mrs. Bill Clinton”, to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.[107] As First Lady of Arkansas again, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[c] She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state’s court-sanctioned public education system.[113][114] In one of the Clinton governorship’s most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[100][113] It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[82][113] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas’s Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[115] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[116][117]\n Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was First Lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours,[118] but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[119] The firm considered her a “rainmaker” because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[119] Bill Clinton’s Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest, because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[120]\n From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[121] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[122] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it.[123] She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 and in 1991.[124] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final time.[125]\n Formal color portrait of Clinton, 1992\n Clinton in 1992\n Clinton served as Chairman of the Board of the Children’s Defense Fund[5][126] and on the board of the Arkansas Children’s Hospital’s Legal Services (1988–92)[127] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–92),[128] Wal-Mart Stores (1986–92)[129] and Lafarge (1990–92).[130] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[119][131] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart’s board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[131] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be added to the company’s management and was silent about the company’s famously anti-labor union practices.[129][131][132]\n Bill Clinton presidential campaign of 1992\n Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[133] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged “causing pain in my marriage”.[134] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[135] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette’s outlook on marriage as described in her classic song “Stand by Your Man”,[d] and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would “get two for the price of one”, referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[141] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg’s August 1992 The American Spectator article “The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock”, Hillary’s own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[92] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[142]\n First Lady of the United States\n When Bill Clinton took office as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press secretary reiterated that she would be using that form of her name.[c] She was the first inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[143] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[60][144] She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[145] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[146][147]\n Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton’s role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband’s presidency.[148] Bill Clinton’s campaign promise of “two for the price of one” led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as “co-presidents” or sometimes use the Arkansas label “Billary”.[100][149][150] The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into “imaginary discussions” with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt.[f] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.[154][155] Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner’s “politics of meaning” to overcome what she saw as America’s “sleeping sickness of the soul”; that would lead to a willingness “to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium.”[156][157]\n Health care and other policy initiatives\n See also: Clinton health care plan of 1993\n Clinton at a presentation on her health care plan in September 1993\n In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[158] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[159][160] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as “Hillarycare” and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress.[161] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[161]\n Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[162] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady’s approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44 percent in April 1994 and 35 percent by September 1994.[163]\n Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections.[164] Republicans saw a net gain of fifty-three seats in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats’ defeat, especially among independent voters.[165] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton’s role in shaping policy.[166] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use “Hillarycare” as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[167]\n Clinton reads a book to an African-American grade-schooler in Maryland during Read Across America Day in 1998\n Clinton reads to a Maryland child during Read Across America Day, 1998\n Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.[168] She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare.[169] She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.[60]\n Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton’s presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming off welfare, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.[170][171] A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again.[170] But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.[170][171] This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called “sad and painful”.[171]\n Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.[60] In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as first lady.[60][172] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care.[172] As first lady, Clinton was the host for various White House conferences, including ones on Child Care (1997),[173] on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997),[174] and on Children and Adolescents (2000).[175] She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000)[176] and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999).[177]\n Clinton traveled to 79 countries during this time,[178] breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon.[179] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[180] A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan.[181] Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps.[182] The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.[183]\n File:First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton’s Remarks to the Fourth Women’s Conference in Beijing, China.webmPlay media\n Clinton delivering her “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights” speech in Beijing in September 1995 (20:19)\n In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued very forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People’s Republic of China itself, declaring that “it is no longer acceptable to discuss women’s rights as separate from human rights”.[184] Delegates from over 180 countries heard her say: “If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights, once and for all.”[185] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[178][185] The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton’s key phrases.[186] She was one of the most prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[187][188] She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.[189] It and Clinton’s own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.[190]\n Whitewater and other investigations\n For more details on these investigations, see Whitewater controversy, Travelgate, Filegate, and Hillary Clinton cattle futures controversy.\n First Lady Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress and the press.\n The Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign[191] and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm[192] and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton’s work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed.[191] She said she had done minimal work for the bank.[193] Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton’s legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.[194][195] The records were found in the First Lady’s White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996.[195] The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been.[195] Clinton’s staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion.[196] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[194] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[197]\n Chelsea, Bill, and Hillary Clinton take an inauguration day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 1997, when Bill started a second term as President.\n The Clintons take an Inauguration Day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to start Bill’s second term as President, January 20, 1997\n Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an affair that became known as “Travelgate”, began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.[198] The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.[199][200] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made “factually false” statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false, or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.[201]\n In March 1994, newspaper reports revealed her spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978–79.[202] Allegations were made in the press of conflict of interest and disguised bribery and several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.[203]\n An outgrowth of the “Travelgate” investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called “Filegate”.[204] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and that she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[205] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[204]\n There was a controversy that arose in early 2001 over gifts made to the White House, rather than to the Clintons personally, that were removed and shipped to the Clintons’ private residence during the last year of Bill Clinton’s time in office.[206][207]\n Response to Lewinsky scandal\n Further information: Lewinsky scandal\n In 1998, the Clintons’ relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had engaged in an extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[208] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the President by the House of Representatives and later acquittal by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a “vast right-wing conspiracy”,[209][210] characterizing the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill’s political enemies[g] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said that she had been misled by her husband’s initial claims that no affair had taken place.[212] After the evidence of President Clinton’s encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage, but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage.[213] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.[214]\n Public reaction varied. Some women admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public, some sympathized with her as a victim of her husband’s insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an enabler to her husband’s indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.[215] Her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around 70 percent, the highest they had ever been.[215] In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to “a love that has persisted for decades” and add: “No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.”[216]\n Issues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills; in 2014, Hillary would state that she and Bill had left the White House “not only dead broke, but in debt.” The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who gave paid speeches after leaving office as well as the couple’s ability to secure loans from banks.[217]\n Traditional duties\n Clinton initiated and was the founding chair of Save America’s Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations in order to preserve and restore historic items and sites,[218] including the flag that inspired “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the First Ladies Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[60] She was head of the White House Millennium Council[219] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[220] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[60] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned from museums.[221]\n In the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the state rooms.[60] She oversaw the restoration of the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe[222] and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II.[223] Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter.[224] These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines.[223] Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.[224] Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year’s Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[60]\n United States Senate\n Main article: United States Senate career of Hillary Clinton\n 2000 U.S. Senate election\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2000\n When New York’s long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan’s open seat in the Senate election of 2000.[225] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.[226] She became the first First Lady of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.[227] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York’s 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state’s politics before the 2000 Senate race.[228]\n Clinton began her campaign, which was managed by Bill de Blasio, by visiting all 62 counties in the State, in a “listening tour” of small-group settings.[229] She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000 jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.[230]\n The contest drew national attention. Lazio blundered during a September debate by seeming to invade Clinton’s personal space trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.[231] The campaigns of Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani’s initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million.[232] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55 percent of the vote to Lazio’s 43 percent.[231] She was sworn in as U.S. Senator on January 3, 2001,[233] making her the first (and so far only) woman to have held an elected office either while,[h] or after, serving as first lady.\n First term\n Clinton being sworn in as U.S. Senator by Vice President Al Gore in 2000.

She is wearing a black suit with a pink shit underneath, and is smiling at the camera while standing behind a chair with yellow upholstery, with her hands folded together upon the chair’s back.\n Clinton’s official photo as U.S. Senator\n Upon entering the Senate, Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties.[234] She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast.[154][235] She served on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001–02),[236] Committee on Armed Services (2003–09),[237] Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001–09), Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001–09)[236] and Special Committee on Aging.[238] She was also a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe[239] (2001–09).[240]\n Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, Clinton sought to obtain funding for the recovery efforts in New York City and security improvements in her state. Working with New York’s senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center site’s redevelopment.[241] She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.[242] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties,[243] before voting in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 in March 2006 that gained large majority support.[244]\n Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[245] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[246]\n After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[247] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain.[248] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush’s pledge to stay “until the job is done” was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis “an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves”.[249] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.[250] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York.[251][252] She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers.[252] (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying that she “got it wrong” and the vote in support had been a “mistake”.[253])\n Clinton voted against President Bush’s two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[254] Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[255][256]\n In 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[257] Along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[254][258]\n Looking to establish a “progressive infrastructure” to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration Chief of Staff John Podesta’s Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons’ former antagonist David Brock’s Media Matters for America, created in 2004.[259] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.[260]\n 2006 re-election campaign\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2006\n In November 2004, Clinton announced that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[261] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance.[262] Clinton’s eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67 percent of the vote to Spencer’s 31 percent,[263] carrying all but four of New York’s sixty-two counties.[264] Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.[265] In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.[266]\n Second term\n Clinton listens as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee.

A man wearing a black suit sits behind Clinton, taking notes.\n Clinton listens as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee\n Clinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging that the surge had been successful).[i] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines[268] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[269] Clinton responded to General David Petraeus’s September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, “I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.”[270]\n In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[271] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[272]\n As the financial crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700 billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying that it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74–25.[273]\n In 2007, Clinton and Virginia Senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[274]\n 2008 presidential campaign\n Main articles: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008 and Hillary Clinton presidential primary campaign, 2008\n Clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. President since at least early 2003.[275] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating “I’m in and I’m in to win.”[276] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency and no First Lady had ever run for President. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed that the couple’s worth was now upwards of $50 million,[277] and that they had earned over $100 million since 2000, with most of it coming from Bill’s books, speaking engagements and other activities.[278]\n  \n Clinton addresses the 2007 CDA National Convention\n Throughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[246] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[246] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[279] At the end of October, Clinton suffered a poor debate performance against Obama, Edwards and her other opponents.[280][281] Obama’s message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton’s message of experience.[282]\n Clinton speaking at a college rally as part of her 2008 Presidential campaign, with a crowd behind her looking on.

Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[288] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[j] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[289] Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[288][290] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[290] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February 5 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former President “needs to stop”.[291] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Hillary Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[292]\n Chart of 50 states, showing state-by-state popular votes in the Democratic primaries and caucuses, shaded by percentage won.

(Popular vote winners and delegate winners differed in New Hampshire, Nevada, Missouri, Texas and Guam.)\n On Super Tuesday, Clinton won the largest states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states;[293] they almost evenly split the total popular vote.[294] But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.[295]\n The Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign.[282][296] There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff and she made several top-level personnel changes.[296][297] Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton.[295][296] On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places,[296] where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband’s presidency, helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular.[298] Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation.[282][295] Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated.[299][300] Behind in delegates, Clinton’s best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.[301]\n Clinton speaking on behalf of Barack Obama before a convention audience during the second night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. Multiple audience members in the foreground wave white flags with the word “Hillary” written in marker.\n Clinton speaks on behalf of her former rival, Barack Obama, during the second night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver\n Following the final primaries on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee.[302] In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[303] By campaign’s end, Clinton had won 1,640 pledged delegates to Obama’s 1,763;[304] at the time of the clinching, Clinton had 286 superdelegates to Obama’s 395,[305] with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner.[304] Clinton and Obama each received over 17 million votes during the nomination process[k] with both breaking the previous record.[306] Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm’s 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman.[286] Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4.[307] Clinton’s campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13 million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.[308]\n U.S. Secretary of State\n Main article: Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State\n See also: Foreign policy of Barack Obama\n Nomination and confirmation\n Hillary Clinton taking oath as Secretary of State on January 21, 2009.

Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.[314]\n The appointment required a Saxbe fix, passed and signed into law in December 2008.[315] Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before the Obama inauguration; two days later, the Committee voted 16–1 to approve Clinton.[316] By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65 percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal.[317] On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94–2.[318] Clinton took the oath of office of Secretary of State, resigning from the Senate later that day.[319] She became the first former first lady to serve in the United States Cabinet.[320]\n First half of tenure\n Obama whispering to Clinton at a summit meeting, with multiple soldiers in uniform standing behind them and heads of state sitting behind and in front of them. They are in the 21st NATO summit, which was held in April 2009.\n Obama and Clinton confer at the 21st NATO summit, April 2009\n Clinton spent her initial days as Secretary of State telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U.S. foreign policy would change direction: “We have a lot of damage to repair.”[321] She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions.[322] Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes specific objectives for the State Department’s diplomatic missions abroad; it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee.[323] The first such review was issued in late 2010 and called for the U.S. leading through “civilian power” as a cost-effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises.[324] It also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world.[185] A cause Clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women.[310]\n Hillary Clinton standing with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Both of them are holding a “reset button”. They are in a room with a window to the left and an American flag behind them\n Clinton with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the “reset button”, March 2009\n In an internal debate regarding the war in Afghanistan during 2009, Clinton sided with the military’s recommendations for a maximal “Afghanistan surge”, recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal; she prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden’s opposition, but eventually supported Obama’s compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.[252][325] In March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a “reset button” symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[326][327] The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev’s time in office, but relations would worsen considerably following Vladimir Putin’s return to the position in 2012.[326] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton’s intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish–Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[328][329] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[183][l] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country’s nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[310][331][332]\n Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president.[333][334] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[335] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[310] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[334] moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon.[336][337] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.[310]\n Clinton greeting U.S. military personnel at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. The personnel are wearing uniforms and standing side-by-side.\n Clinton greets service members at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, October 2010\n In a prepared speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet.[338] Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it and the speech garnered attention as the first time a senior American official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy.[339] In July 2010, she visited Korea, Vietnam, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all the while preparing for the July 31 wedding of daughter Chelsea amid much media attention.[340]\n Second half of tenure\n The 2011 Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis for the administration yet.[341] Clinton’s public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was “stable”, to a stance that there needed to be an “orderly transition [to] a democratic participatory government”, to a condemnation of violence against the protesters.[342][343] Obama came to rely upon Clinton’s advice, organization and personal connections in the behind-the-scenes response to developments.[341] As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region, Clinton was at the forefront of a U.S. response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory, backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others.[344]\n Hillary Clinton speaks at a London meeting to discuss NATO military intervention in Libya on March 29, 2011. She is standing behind a blue podium with a sign that has the words “THE LONDON CONFERENCE ON LIBYA” printed in white-on-blue text in capital letters.\n The London meeting to discuss NATO military intervention in Libya, March 29, 2011\n As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton’s shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[344][345][346] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution and the State Department’s legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution’s 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[347] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called “convening power” to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[345] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state,[348] and the wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[349][350][351]\n During April 2011 internal deliberations of the president’s innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[352][353] Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden’s death, Clinton played a key role in the administration’s decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[354] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).[252][355]\n Clinton standing with Aung San Suu Kyi. The two women are discussing something during Clinton’s 2011 visit to Burma.\n Clinton meeting with Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi as part of her historic December 2011 visit to that country\n In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that “Gay rights are human rights” and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad.[356] The same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary of state since 1955, as she met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms.[357][358] She also said that the 21st century would be “America’s Pacific century”,[359] a declaration that was part of the Obama administration’s “pivot to Asia”.[360]\n During the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama administration initially sought to persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform, then as government violence allegedly rose in August 2011, called for him to resign from the presidency.[361] The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria.[362] During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels, but the proposal was rejected by the White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict and who feared that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.[357][363]\n In December 2012 Clinton was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus.[364] Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe.[364][365] The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.[365][366][m]\n Overall themes\n President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on Operation Neptune’s Spear, a mission against Osama bin Laden, in one of the conference rooms of the Situation Room of the White House, on May 1, 2011.

Several of the attendees are sitting down, while others stand behind them. Everyone in the room is watching a live feed from drones operating over the Osama bin Laden complex.\n Throughout her time in office and in her final speech concluding it, Clinton viewed “smart power” as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values—in a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities—by combining military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy.[345][370] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.[371] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[252][335][355] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[372]\n Clinton greatly expanded the State Department’s use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, both to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-à-vis their governments.[345] And in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[185] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the “Hillary Doctrine”, she viewed women’s rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[333][373] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.[374]\n Clinton visited 112 countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[375][n] (Time magazine wrote that “Clinton’s endurance is legendary”).[345] The first secretary of state to visit countries such as Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[378] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as Secretary of State should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[346] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton’s successor.[365] Her last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013.[379] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton’s tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other Secretaries of State had,[336][337] and highlighted her focus on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.[380]\n Benghazi attack and subsequent hearings\n See also: 2012 Benghazi attack and United States House Select Committee on Benghazi\n Obama and Clinton at a somber occasion, honoring the Benghazi attack victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony, held at Andrews Air Force Base on September 14, 2012.

Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[381] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[381][382]\n On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[383] It focused its criticism on the department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[384] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[383]\n Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[385] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate “talking points” after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, “With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.”[385][386] In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration’s response to the attack.[387]\n Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015. She is standing behind a podium with a microphone, with many people behind her.\n Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015\n The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack.[388] Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics.[388][389] This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton’s poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans’ previous talking points on the investigation.[388][390] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[391][392] The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves.[391] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[393] The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines,[388] with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.[389]\n Email controversy\n Main article: Hillary Clinton email controversy\n A controversy arose in March 2015, when it was revealed by the State Department’s inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton’s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[394][395]\n In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and “never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.” They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[396] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[397] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called “born classified” category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[398] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton’s server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[399] Additionally, the intelligence community’s inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails “contained classified State Department information when originated.”[400] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[401]\n Clinton maintained that she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, “I never sent or received any classified material – they are retroactively classifying it.” On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: “Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.”[402][403]\n On July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said:\n 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were “up-classified” to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[399][404]\n Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small “c” in parentheses, described as “portion markings” by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not “technically sophisticated” enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.[404] The probe found that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI assessed that it “is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account.” Comey stated that although Clinton or her colleagues were “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information”, the FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that “no charges are appropriate in this case.”[399] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed that the probe into Clinton’s use of private email servers while secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges.[405]\n On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI started looking into newly discovered emails. Law enforcement officials stated while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered e-mails related to Clinton’s private server on a laptop computer belonging to Anthony Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its conclusion reached in July.[406] The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election.[407]\n Clinton Foundation and speeches\n Main article: Clinton Foundation\n Clinton standing behind lectern\n Clinton in September 2014\n When Clinton left the State Department, she became a private citizen for the first time in thirty years.[408] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[409] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[409][410]\n Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[411] its March 2015 report said that while “There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman … this data shows just how far we still have to go.”[412] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary.[o] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[415]\n She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[416] There she received $200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[416][417] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[416] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11 million from her speeches.[418] For the overall period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141 million, paid some $56 million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15 million to charity.[419] As of 2015, she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her own, or $45–53 million with her husband.[420]\n Clinton resigned from the foundation’s board in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign and the foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[o]\n 2016 presidential campaign\n  \n Clinton campaigning for president in Manchester, New Hampshire, in October 2016, with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (seated)\n Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016\n Further information: United States presidential election, 2016; Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016; and Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016\n On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[421] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure.[422] The campaign’s headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[423] Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act.[424][425] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[421] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton’s Wall Street ties.[417][425]\n In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders,[426][427] making her the first woman to win the Iowa caucuses.[426] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[428] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[429] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[430] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[429] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[429]\n On March 1 (“Super Tuesday”), Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[431] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[432][433][434]\n By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[435] On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[436] By campaign’s end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders’ 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders’ 47.[437] She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders’ 13 million.[438]\n  \n Bernie Sanders endorsing Clinton in New Hampshire, July 2016\n Clinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.[439] Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following day.[440] Her opponents in the general election were Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party.\n Clinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton became tied in major polls following the FBI’s conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[441] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her handling of classified government material.[442] In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention, in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it is toward the small side by historical standards.[443][444] Following Clinton’s 7 percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[445][446]\n Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016 presidential election.[447] By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win and media sources proclaimed him the winner.[448] Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave a victory speech.[449] The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying “We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.”[450] Though Clinton lost the election by only capturing 232 electors to Trump’s 306, a month after the election the popular vote count showed her leading by more than 2.7 million votes, with many votes yet to be counted.[451] She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.[452][453]\n On December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes instead being cast for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.[454]\n Clinton speaking behind a podium with a microphone in her hand.

The morning of the inauguration Clinton wrote on her Twitter account, “I’m here today to honor our democracy &amp; its enduring values, I will never stop believing in our country &amp; its future.”[455]\n On March 17, 2017 Clinton delivered a St. Patrick’s Day speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Making reference to reports of her being seen taking walks in woods around Chappaqua following her loss in the presidential election,[456][457] Clinton indicated her readiness to emerge from “the woods” and become politically active again.[456]\n In April 2017, Clinton commented that she will not seek public office again.[458]\n Clinton revealed Onward Together, a new political action committee that she wrote as being “dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election”, in a several tweets and an email in May 2017.[459]\n In a June 5, 2017 appearance at the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel, Clinton condemned the 2017 Portland train attack: “When violence motivated by hatred from, Portland, Oregon, to College Park, ends the lives of young Americans, this program’s mission of spreading tolerance is more urgent than ever.”[460] On June 14, after the Congressional baseball shooting, Clinton tweeted, “2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we’re all ultimately on one team. My thoughts are with the members of Congress, staff &amp; heroic police.”[461]\n Comments on President Trump\n On February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indians by Adam Purinton.[462] On April 6, in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Clinton said the US should take out the air fields of Bashar al-Assad and thereby “prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.”[463] On May 2, Clinton said Trump’s use of Twitter “doesn’t work” when pursuing important negotiations and North Korea should not be consulted with an abandoning “of a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table with some kind of realistic prospect for change.”[464] While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump’s 2018 budget proposal was “a con” for underfunding domestic programs.[465] During an appearance at Recode’s Code Conference on May 31, Clinton suggested Trump’s incomplete tweet from earlier in the day was “a hidden message to the Russians.”[466] The following day, after President Trump announced withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a “historic mistake.”[467]\n On March 24, 2017, after the postponing of a Congressional vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Clinton labeled the day “a victory for the 24,000,000 people at risk of losing their health insurance” and warned of an ongoing battle to maintain coverage.[468] Clinton went on to call the American Health Care Act “a disastrous bill” during a San Francisco speech four days later.[469] May 4, after the House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act, Clinton dubbed it a “shameful failure of policy &amp; morality by GOP”.[470] On June 23, the day after Senate Republicans revealed a draft of their healthcare reform legislation, Clinton tweeted, “This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics. Speak out against this bill.”[471]\n Political positions\n Main article: Political positions of Hillary Clinton\n Secretary of State Clinton meets with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Clinton is in favor of maintaining U.S. influence in the Middle East.\n Several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton’s place on the political spectrum scientifically using her Senate votes. National Journal’s 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[472] National Journal’s subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[473] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her to be likely the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[474] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75 liberal, 23 conservative; Social = 83 liberal, 6 conservative; Foreign = 66 liberal, 30 conservative. Total average = 75 liberal, 20 conservative.[p] According to FiveThirtyEight’s measure of political ideology, “Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.”[475]\n Organizations have also attempted to give newer assessments of Clinton once she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in their “Left Liberal” region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances and an economic score of 10 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[476] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[477] Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90 percent “Liberal Quotient” from Americans for Democratic Action,[478] and a lifetime 8 percent rating from the American Conservative Union.[479]\n In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called “optimistic” and “wide-ranging”. Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a “clawback” that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an “exit tax” on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[480] Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as “the gold standard”[481] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that “any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security”.[482][483] As Senator (2001–2009), her record on trade was mixed, voting in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[482]\n Given the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit “unaccountable money” in politics.[484] In July 2016, she “committed” to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.[485][486] On December 7, 2015, in The New York Times, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities.[487]\n Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign logo, a large blue letter “H” with a red arrow facing right, overlaying the horizontal bar of the “H”. The head of the arrow is also overlaid over the right vertical bar of the “H”, with two small blue triangles poking out where the bar of the “H” is not covered by the arrow.\n Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign logo\n Clinton accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, supports cap-and-trade,[488] and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline.[489]\n She supported “equal pay for equal work,” to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do.[490] Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool.[484] These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a “fair share surcharge”.[491]\n Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act[492] and would have added a “public option” that would have competed against private insurers and enabled people “50 or 55 and up” to buy into Medicare.[493][494]\n On LGBT rights, she supported the right to same-sex marriage.[484] Clinton first expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage in 2013; in 2000, she had been against such unions altogether and in 2006, she said only that she would support a state’s decision to permit same-sex marriages.[495] In 2000, she was the first First Lady to march in an LGBT pride parade.[496] In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).[497]\n Clinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship “[i]s at its heart a family issue”,[498] and expressed support for Obama’s Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States.[499][500] She opposed and criticized Trump’s call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[501]\n Clinton expressed support for Common Core.[502] She said, “The really unfortunate argument that’s been going on around Common Core, it’s very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn’t politicized…. Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven’t had that and so don’t understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.”[503]\n On foreign affairs, Clinton voted in October 2002 in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq,[504] a vote she later “regretted.”[505] She favored arming Syria’s rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[506] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[507][508] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[501] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, “America can’t ever be neutral when it comes to Israel’s security and survival.”[509] Clinton expressed support for Israel’s right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[510][511] In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields.[512]\n In 2000, Clinton advocated for eliminating the electoral college[513] and promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it resulting in the direct election of the president.[514][515]\n Religious views\n Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church:\n First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge, Illinois—in her early life,\n First United Methodist Church of Little Rock, Arkansas—while in Arkansas,\n Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C.—as First Lady of the United States,\n Metropolitan Community United Methodist Church in New York, New York—currently a congregant.\n She discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.[516] However, she has infrequently discussed her faith while campaigning.[517][518] Clinton has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one’s neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and “creating opportunities for others to be lifted up”.[518] Clinton has also expressed disappointment that “Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.”[518]\n Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has suggested that Clinton’s political positions are rooted in her faith. Clinton often expresses a certain maxim which is often attributed to John Wesley: “Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.”[517] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy “made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith.”[519]\n Writings and recordings\n See also: Bibliography of Hillary Clinton\n External video\n Booknotes interview with Clinton about It Takes a Village, March 3, 1996, C-SPAN\n Informal pose of Clinton, in which she is wearing a beige wool jacket and facing toward the right. The angle at which Clinton is photographed is from her bottom right side.\n Clinton in February 2011\n As First Lady of the United States, Clinton published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled “Talking It Over” from 1995 to 2000.[520][521] It focused on her experiences and those of women, children and families she met during her travels around the world.[5]\n In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for the children of America in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. The book made the Best Seller list of The New York Times and Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book’s audio recording.[522] She was the first First Lady to win a Grammy Award.[523]\n Other books published by Clinton when she was first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids’ Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children’s book Beatrice’s Goat.[524]\n In 2003, Clinton released a 562-page autobiography, Living History, for which publisher Simon &amp; Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8 million.[525] The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[526] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[527] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[528] Clinton’s audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[529]\n In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as Secretary of State. As of July 2015, the book has sold about 280,000 copies.[530]\n In 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States if they had won the 2016 presidential election.[531]\n Clinton authored her third memoir, What Happened, about the 2016 election, which was released on September 12, 2017, by Simon &amp; Schuster, in print, e-book, and audio read by the author.[532] A book tour and series of interviews and personal appearances were arranged for the launch.[533]\n Cultural and political image\n Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton, from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found “a virtual cottage industry” of “anti-Clinton literature”, put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints, with titles such as Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary’s Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton’s Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless … Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[534] (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[535] Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable “bogeyman” to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[536]\n Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture from a wide spectrum of varying perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[537] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, “Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.”[538] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as first lady and has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers.[539][540] Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her, including but not limited to “The Hillary Shimmy Song”, which went viral.[541][542][543][544]\n A three-story, red brick building in Arkansas. The Rose Law Firm is located inside this building. Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years.\n Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years. Her professional career and political involvement set the stage for public reaction to her as first lady.\n Clinton has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, with some arguing otherwise.[545] James Madison University political science professor Valerie Sulfaro’s 2007 study used the American National Election Studies’ “feeling thermometer” polls, which measure the degree of opinion about a political figure, to find that such polls during Clinton’s first lady years confirm the “conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure”, with the added insight that “affect towards Mrs. Clinton as first lady tended to be very positive or very negative, with a fairly constant one fourth of respondents feeling ambivalent or neutral”.[546] University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson’s 2006 study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state’s senators, Clinton had the fourth-largest partisan difference of any senator, with a 50-percentage-point difference in approval between New York’s Democrats and Republicans.[547]\n Northern Illinois University political science professor Barbara Burrell’s 2000 study found that Clinton’s Gallup poll favorability numbers broke sharply along partisan lines throughout her time as first lady, with 70 to 90 percent of Democrats typically viewing her favorably while only 20 to 40 percent of Republicans did.[548] University of Wisconsin–Madison political science professor Charles Franklin analyzed her record of favorable versus unfavorable ratings in public opinion polls and found that there was more variation in them during her first lady years than her Senate years. The Senate years showed favorable ratings around 50 percent and unfavorable ratings in the mid-40 percent range; Franklin noted that, “This sharp split is, of course, one of the more widely remarked aspects of Sen. Clinton’s public image.”[549] McGill University professor of history Gil Troy titled his 2006 biography of her Hillary Rodham Clinton: Polarizing First Lady and wrote that after the 1992 campaign, Clinton “was a polarizing figure, with 42 percent [of the public] saying she came closer to their values and lifestyle than previous first ladies and 41 percent disagreeing.”[550] Troy further wrote that Clinton “has been uniquely controversial and contradictory since she first appeared on the national radar screen in 1992” and that she “has alternately fascinated, bedeviled, bewitched and appalled Americans.”[551]\n Line chart showing Clinton’s favorability rankings from 1992 to 2016. The ratings show her as a controversial first lady whose ratings hit a low following the Hillarycare failure and a high following the Lewinsky scandal. Opinion about her was closely divided during her 2000 Senate campaign, mildly positive during her time as a senator, and then closely divided again during her 2008 presidential campaign. As secretary of state, she enjoyed widespread approval, before dipping as her tenure ended and then to some of her lowest ratings ever as she became viewed as a presidential candidate again.\n Clinton’s Gallup Poll favorable and unfavorable ratings, 1992–2016.[552]\n The ratings show her as a controversial first lady whose ratings hit a low following the Hillarycare failure and a high following the Lewinsky scandal.

As secretary of state, she enjoyed widespread approval, before dipping as her tenure ended and then to some of her lowest ratings ever as she became viewed as a presidential candidate again.[553]\n Burrell’s study found women consistently rating Clinton more favorably than men by about ten percentage points during her first lady years.[548] Jacobson’s study found a positive correlation across all senators between being women and receiving a partisan-polarized response.[547] Colorado State University communication studies professor Karrin Vasby Anderson describes the first lady position as a “site” for American womanhood, one ready made for the symbolic negotiation of female identity.[554] In particular anderson states there has been a cultural bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against modern first ladies; by the time of Clinton, the first lady position had become a site of heterogeneity and paradox.[554] Burrell, as well as biographers Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., note that Clinton achieved her highest approval ratings as first lady late in 1998, not for professional or political achievements of her own, but for being seen as the victim of her husband’s very public infidelity.[215][548] University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson saw Clinton as an exemplar of the double bind, who though able to live in a “both-and” world of both career and family, nevertheless “became a surrogate on whom we projected our attitudes about attributes once thought incompatible”, leading to her being placed in a variety of no-win situations.[538] Quinnipiac University media studies professor Lisa Burns found press accounts frequently framing Clinton both as an exemplar of the modern professional working mother and as a political interloper interested in usurping power for herself.[555] University of Indianapolis English professor Charlotte Templin found political cartoonists using a variety of stereotypes—such as gender reversal, radical feminist as emasculator and the wife the husband wants to get rid of—to portray Clinton as violating gender norms.[556]\n Side profile of Clinton facing toward her right side. She is speaking into a microphone.\n Clinton in 2009\n Going into the early stages of her presidential campaign for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled “Love Her”, “Hate Her”,[557] while Mother Jones titled its profile of her “Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary”.[558] Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates,[559] while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all.[560][561] An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled “The Waning Power of Hillary Hate”.[562] By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation.[563] She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton’s laugh,[564] that “We know that there’s language to condemn female speech that doesn’t exist for male speech. We call women’s speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton’s laugh was being described as a cackle.”[563] The “bitch” epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics,[565] flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well.[566] Following Clinton’s “choked up moment” and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender’s role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[567][568] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events “brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades … she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics.”[568]\n Hillary Clinton dressed in a black suit and a green shirt, sitting in a café.

The foreground is distorted due to the presence of various small objects.\n Clinton in April 2015\n Once she became Secretary of State, Clinton’s image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.[333][569] She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal),[570] and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure.[569][571] A 2012 Internet meme, “Texts from Hillary”, was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics.[572] Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, “There’s a certain consistency to who I am and what I do and I think people have finally said, ‘Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'”[333] She continued to do well in Gallup’s most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.[573]\n Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[574] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[575] During 2016 she acknowledged that: “I’m not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed.”[576] In July 2017 Bloomberg showed her approval rating at 39 percent.[577]\n Electoral history\n Main article: Electoral history of Hillary Clinton\n New York United States Senate election, 2000\n Party Candidate Votes % ±\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 3,747,310 55.3\n Republican Rick Lazio 2,915,730 43.0\n New York United States Senate election, 2006\n Party Candidate Votes % ±\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 3,008,428 67.0 +11.7\n Republican John Spencer 1,392,189 31.0 −12.0\n Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008\n Party Candidate Votes %\n Democratic Barack Obama 17,584,692 (popular votes)\n 2,272.5 delegates\n (33 states) 47.3% of popular vote\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 17,857,501 (popular votes)\n 1,978 delegates\n (23 states) 48.0% of popular vote\n Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016\n Party Candidate Votes %\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 16,914,722 (popular votes)\n 2,842 delegates\n (34 states) 55.2% of popular vote\n Democratic Bernie Sanders 13,206,428 (popular votes)\n 1,865 delegates\n (23 states) 43.1% of popular vote\n United States presidential election, 2016\n Party Candidate Votes %\n Republican Donald Trump 62,979,879 (popular votes)\n 304 electors\n (30 states + ME-02) 46.0% (popular vote)\n 56.5% (electoral vote)\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 65,844,954 (popular votes)\n 227 electors\n (20 states + DC) 48.1% (popular vote)\n 42.2% (electoral vote)\n Early life\n Museum display case containing photographs, papers, shoes, doll, and other early childhood artifacts of Hillary Rodham’s early life\n Mementos of Hillary Rodham’s early life are shown at the William J. Clinton Presidential Center\n Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.[5][6] Clinton was raised in a United Methodist family that first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge.[7] Her father, Hugh Rodham (1911–1993), was of English and Welsh descent,[8] and managed a small but successful textile business.[9] Her mother, Dorothy Howell (1919–2011), was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent.[8][10][11] Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[12]\n As a child, Rodham was a favorite student of her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge.[13] She participated in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.[13] She has often told a story[14][15][16] of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[17] She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[5][18] She was elected class vice president for her junior year, but then lost for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that “you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president”.[19] For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted “most likely to succeed”. She graduated in her class’s top five percent in 1965.[20]\n Rodham’s mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career,[11] and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter’s abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[21] Raised in a politically conservative household,[11] Rodham helped canvass Chicago’s South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon.[22] She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[23] Rodham’s early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater’s The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago’s Orchestra Hall.[24]\n Wellesley College years\n In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[25][26] During her freshman year, she served as president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[27][28] As the leader of this “Rockefeller Republican”-oriented group,[29] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to Mayor of New York City and Massachusetts Attorney General Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[30] She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the American Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[27] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as “a mind conservative and a heart liberal”.[31] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[32][33]\n By her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[34] In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969.[32][35] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley’s black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[34] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[32][36] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.[32]\n To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference and she attended the “Wellesley in Washington” summer program.[34] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[34] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon’s campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention’s “veiled” racist messages and left the Republican Party for good.[34] Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[37] (Years later, while she was first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[37])\n In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[38] with departmental honors in political science.[37] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke.[35][39] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[32][40][41] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[42][43] due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[39] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet’s nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[44] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).[45]\n Yale Law School and postgraduate studies\n Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she served on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[46] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[47] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48][49] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital[48] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.[47] In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman’s Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale’s Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers’ issues including education, health and housing.[50] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[51] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[52]\n In the late spring of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, who was also a law student at Yale. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);[53] Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[a] Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California;[57] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[54] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.[58] She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[38] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.[59] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[59]\n Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[60] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, “Children Under the Law”, was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[61] Discussing the new children’s rights movement, the article stated that “child citizens” were “powerless individuals”[62] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis.[63] The article became frequently cited in the field.[64]\n Marriage, family, law career and First Lady of Arkansas\n From the East Coast to Arkansas\n During her postgraduate study, Rodham served as staff attorney for Edelman’s newly founded Children’s Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[65] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[66] In 1974 she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., advising the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[67] Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,[48] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for impeachment.[67] The committee’s work culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[67]\n By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham’s career.[68] Wright thought she had the potential to become a future senator or president.[69] Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him and she continued to demur.[70] After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[71] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, “I chose to follow my heart instead of my head”.[72] She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.[73][74]\n Early Arkansas years\n At the university, Rodham gave classes in criminal law, where she was considered to be a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.[75] She became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.[76] In one of her cases, she was mandated by the court to serve as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. Clinton used an effective defense that led her client to plead guilty to a much lesser charge. Decades later, the victim said that the defense counsel had put her “through hell” during the legal process; Hillary Clinton has called the trial a “terrible case”.[77] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city’s first rape crisis center.[76] Rodham still harbored doubts about marriage, concerned that her separate identity would be lost and her accomplishments viewed in the light of someone else’s.[78]\n Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she finally agreed to marry him.[79] Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.[80] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham.[81][82] The motivation was to keep the couple’s professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because, as she told a friend at the time, “it showed that I was still me.”[83] The decision upset both of their more traditional mothers.[84] Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[85] There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[86] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[46] while also working pro bono in child advocacy;[87] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[88]\n Rodham maintained her interest in children’s law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles “Children’s Policies: Abandonment and Neglect” in 1977[89] and “Children’s Rights: A Legal Perspective” in 1979.[90] The latter continued her argument that children’s legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, “Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.”[63] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as “one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades”,[91] while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[92] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[63] and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.[93]\n A small, one-story brick-faced house with a small yard in front. This house is located in Little Rock, Arkansas. Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton lived in this house when Bill was Arkansas Attorney General from 1977 to 1979.\n Rodham and Clinton lived in this house in Little Rock’s Hillcrest neighborhood while he was Arkansas Attorney General (1977–1979).[94]\n In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children’s Defense Fund.[46][95] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[96] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation,[97] and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981.[98] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[b] she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job.[99] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan’s attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[87]\n Following her husband’s November 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state’s First Lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve years (1979–81, 1983–92). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[100] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas’s poorest areas without affecting doctors’ fees.[101]\n In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm.[102] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[103] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[104] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[105] At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[104] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.\n On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to her only child, daughter Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[106]\n Later Arkansas years\n The Reagans and the Clintons walking a red carpet during the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors\n Governor Bill and First Lady Hillary Clinton attend the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors with President Ronald and First Lady Nancy Reagan.\n Bill Clinton returned to the governor’s office two years later after winning the election of 1982. During her husband’s campaign, Hillary began to use the name “Hillary Clinton”, or sometimes “Mrs. Bill Clinton”, to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.[107] As First Lady of Arkansas again, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[c] She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state’s court-sanctioned public education system.[113][114] In one of the Clinton governorship’s most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[100][113] It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[82][113] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas’s Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[115] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[116][117]\n Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was First Lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours,[118] but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[119] The firm considered her a “rainmaker” because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[119] Bill Clinton’s Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest, because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[120]\n From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[121] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[122] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it.[123] She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 and in 1991.[124] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final time.[125]\n Formal color portrait of Clinton, 1992\n Clinton in 1992\n Clinton served as Chairman of the Board of the Children’s Defense Fund[5][126] and on the board of the Arkansas Children’s Hospital’s Legal Services (1988–92)[127] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–92),[128] Wal-Mart Stores (1986–92)[129] and Lafarge (1990–92).[130] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[119][131] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart’s board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[131] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be added to the company’s management and was silent about the company’s famously anti-labor union practices.[129][131][132]\n Bill Clinton presidential campaign of 1992\n Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[133] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged “causing pain in my marriage”.[134] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[135] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette’s outlook on marriage as described in her classic song “Stand by Your Man”,[d] and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would “get two for the price of one”, referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[141] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg’s August 1992 The American Spectator article “The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock”, Hillary’s own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[92] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[142]\n First Lady of the United States\n When Bill Clinton took office as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press secretary reiterated that she would be using that form of her name.[c] She was the first inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[143] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[60][144] She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[145] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[146][147]\n Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton’s role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband’s presidency.[148] Bill Clinton’s campaign promise of “two for the price of one” led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as “co-presidents” or sometimes use the Arkansas label “Billary”.[100][149][150] The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into “imaginary discussions” with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt.[f] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.[154][155] Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner’s “politics of meaning” to overcome what she saw as America’s “sleeping sickness of the soul”; that would lead to a willingness “to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium.”[156][157]\n Health care and other policy initiatives\n See also: Clinton health care plan of 1993\n Clinton at a presentation on her health care plan in September 1993\n In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[158] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[159][160] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as “Hillarycare” and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress.[161] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[161]\n Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[162] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady’s approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44 percent in April 1994 and 35 percent by September 1994.[163]\n Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections.[164] Republicans saw a net gain of fifty-three seats in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats’ defeat, especially among independent voters.[165] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton’s role in shaping policy.[166] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use “Hillarycare” as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[167]\n Clinton reads a book to an African-American grade-schooler in Maryland during Read Across America Day in 1998\n Clinton reads to a Maryland child during Read Across America Day, 1998\n Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.[168] She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare.[169] She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.[60]\n Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton’s presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming off welfare, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.[170][171] A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again.[170] But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.[170][171] This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called “sad and painful”.[171]\n Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.[60] In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as first lady.[60][172] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care.[172] As first lady, Clinton was the host for various White House conferences, including ones on Child Care (1997),[173] on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997),[174] and on Children and Adolescents (2000).[175] She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000)[176] and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999).[177]\n Clinton traveled to 79 countries during this time,[178] breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon.[179] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[180] A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan.[181] Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps.[182] The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.[183]\n File:First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton’s Remarks to the Fourth Women’s Conference in Beijing, China.webmPlay media\n Clinton delivering her “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights” speech in Beijing in September 1995 (20:19)\n In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued very forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People’s Republic of China itself, declaring that “it is no longer acceptable to discuss women’s rights as separate from human rights”.[184] Delegates from over 180 countries heard her say: “If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights, once and for all.”[185] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[178][185] The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton’s key phrases.[186] She was one of the most prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[187][188] She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.[189] It and Clinton’s own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.[190]\n Whitewater and other investigations\n For more details on these investigations, see Whitewater controversy, Travelgate, Filegate, and Hillary Clinton cattle futures controversy.\n First Lady Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress and the press.\n The Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign[191] and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm[192] and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton’s work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed.[191] She said she had done minimal work for the bank.[193] Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton’s legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.[194][195] The records were found in the First Lady’s White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996.[195] The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been.[195] Clinton’s staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion.[196] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[194] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[197]\n Chelsea, Bill, and Hillary Clinton take an inauguration day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 1997, when Bill started a second term as President.\n The Clintons take an Inauguration Day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to start Bill’s second term as President, January 20, 1997\n Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an affair that became known as “Travelgate”, began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.[198] The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.[199][200] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made “factually false” statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false, or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.[201]\n In March 1994, newspaper reports revealed her spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978–79.[202] Allegations were made in the press of conflict of interest and disguised bribery and several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.[203]\n An outgrowth of the “Travelgate” investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called “Filegate”.[204] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and that she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[205] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[204]\n There was a controversy that arose in early 2001 over gifts made to the White House, rather than to the Clintons personally, that were removed and shipped to the Clintons’ private residence during the last year of Bill Clinton’s time in office.[206][207]\n Response to Lewinsky scandal\n Further information: Lewinsky scandal\n In 1998, the Clintons’ relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had engaged in an extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[208] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the President by the House of Representatives and later acquittal by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a “vast right-wing conspiracy”,[209][210] characterizing the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill’s political enemies[g] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said that she had been misled by her husband’s initial claims that no affair had taken place.[212] After the evidence of President Clinton’s encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage, but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage.[213] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.[214]\n Public reaction varied. Some women admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public, some sympathized with her as a victim of her husband’s insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an enabler to her husband’s indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.[215] Her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around 70 percent, the highest they had ever been.[215] In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to “a love that has persisted for decades” and add: “No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.”[216]\n Issues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills; in 2014, Hillary would state that she and Bill had left the White House “not only dead broke, but in debt.” The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who gave paid speeches after leaving office as well as the couple’s ability to secure loans from banks.[217]\n Traditional duties\n Clinton initiated and was the founding chair of Save America’s Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations in order to preserve and restore historic items and sites,[218] including the flag that inspired “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the First Ladies Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[60] She was head of the White House Millennium Council[219] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[220] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[60] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned from museums.[221]\n In the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the state rooms.[60] She oversaw the restoration of the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe[222] and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II.[223] Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter.[224] These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines.[223] Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.[224] Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year’s Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[60]\n United States Senate\n Main article: United States Senate career of Hillary Clinton\n 2000 U.S. Senate election\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2000\n When New York’s long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan’s open seat in the Senate election of 2000.[225] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.[226] She became the first First Lady of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.[227] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York’s 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state’s politics before the 2000 Senate race.[228]\n Clinton began her campaign, which was managed by Bill de Blasio, by visiting all 62 counties in the State, in a “listening tour” of small-group settings.[229] She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000 jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.[230]\n The contest drew national attention. Lazio blundered during a September debate by seeming to invade Clinton’s personal space trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.[231] The campaigns of Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani’s initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million.[232] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55 percent of the vote to Lazio’s 43 percent.[231] She was sworn in as U.S. Senator on January 3, 2001,[233] making her the first (and so far only) woman to have held an elected office either while,[h] or after, serving as first lady.\n First term\n Clinton being sworn in as U.S. Senator by Vice President Al Gore in 2000.

She is wearing a black suit with a pink shit underneath, and is smiling at the camera while standing behind a chair with yellow upholstery, with her hands folded together upon the chair’s back.\n Clinton’s official photo as U.S. Senator\n Upon entering the Senate, Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties.[234] She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast.[154][235] She served on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001–02),[236] Committee on Armed Services (2003–09),[237] Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001–09), Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001–09)[236] and Special Committee on Aging.[238] She was also a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe[239] (2001–09).[240]\n Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, Clinton sought to obtain funding for the recovery efforts in New York City and security improvements in her state. Working with New York’s senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center site’s redevelopment.[241] She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.[242] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties,[243] before voting in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 in March 2006 that gained large majority support.[244]\n Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[245] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[246]\n After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[247] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain.[248] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush’s pledge to stay “until the job is done” was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis “an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves”.[249] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.[250] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York.[251][252] She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers.[252] (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying that she “got it wrong” and the vote in support had been a “mistake”.[253])\n Clinton voted against President Bush’s two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[254] Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[255][256]\n In 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[257] Along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[254][258]\n Looking to establish a “progressive infrastructure” to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration Chief of Staff John Podesta’s Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons’ former antagonist David Brock’s Media Matters for America, created in 2004.[259] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.[260]\n 2006 re-election campaign\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2006\n In November 2004, Clinton announced that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[261] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance.[262] Clinton’s eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67 percent of the vote to Spencer’s 31 percent,[263] carrying all but four of New York’s sixty-two counties.[264] Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.[265] In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.[266]\n Second term\n Clinton listens as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee. She is in the background, sitting behind a desk with a placard bearing the words “MRS CLINTON”, and is wearing a blue suit. A man wearing a black suit sits behind Clinton, taking notes.\n Clinton listens as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee\n Clinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging that the surge had been successful).[i] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines[268] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[269] Clinton responded to General David Petraeus’s September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, “I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.”[270]\n In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[271] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[272]\n As the financial crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700 billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying that it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74–25.[273]\n In 2007, Clinton and Virginia Senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[274]\n 2008 presidential campaign\n Main articles: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008 and Hillary Clinton presidential primary campaign, 2008\n Clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. President since at least early 2003.[275] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating “I’m in and I’m in to win.”[276] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency and no First Lady had ever run for President. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed that the couple’s worth was now upwards of $50 million,[277] and that they had earned over $100 million since 2000, with most of it coming from Bill’s books, speaking engagements and other activities.[278]\n  \n Clinton addresses the 2007 CDA National Convention\n Throughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[246] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[246] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[279] At the end of October, Clinton suffered a poor debate performance against Obama, Edwards and her other opponents.[280][281] Obama’s message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton’s message of experience.[282]\n Clinton speaking at a college rally as part of her 2008 Presidential campaign, with a crowd behind her looking on. She is speaking at Augsburg College in Minneapolis, two days before “Super Tuesday”, the day in 2008 when the largest number of simultaneous state-level elections was held.

There are blue banners with the word “Hillary” on them, hung around the room, as well as a large white-on-burgundy banner with the words “Augsburg College”.\n Clinton campaigning at Augsburg College in Minneapolis, Minnesota, two days before Super Tuesday, 2008\n In the first vote of 2008, she placed third in the January 3 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards.[283] Obama gained ground in national polling in the next few days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary.[284] Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, defeating Obama narrowly.[285] It was the first time a woman had won a major American party’s presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection.[286] Explanations for Clinton’s New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter’s question the day before the election.[287]\n The nature of the contest fractured in the next few days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[288] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[j] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[289] Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[288][290] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[290] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February 5 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former President “needs to stop”.[291] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Hillary Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[292]\n Chart of 50 states, showing state-by-state popular votes in the Democratic primaries and caucuses, shaded by percentage won.

(Popular vote winners and delegate winners differed in New Hampshire, Nevada, Missouri, Texas and Guam.)\n On Super Tuesday, Clinton won the largest states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states;[293] they almost evenly split the total popular vote.[294] But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.[295]\n The Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign.[282][296] There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff and she made several top-level personnel changes.[296][297] Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton.[295][296] On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places,[296] where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband’s presidency, helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular.[298] Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation.[282][295] Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated.[299][300] Behind in delegates, Clinton’s best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.[301]\n Clinton speaking on behalf of Barack Obama before a convention audience during the second night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. Multiple audience members in the foreground wave white flags with the word “Hillary” written in marker.\n Clinton speaks on behalf of her former rival, Barack Obama, during the second night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver\n Following the final primaries on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee.[302] In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[303] By campaign’s end, Clinton had won 1,640 pledged delegates to Obama’s 1,763;[304] at the time of the clinching, Clinton had 286 superdelegates to Obama’s 395,[305] with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner.[304] Clinton and Obama each received over 17 million votes during the nomination process[k] with both breaking the previous record.[306] Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm’s 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman.[286] Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4.[307] Clinton’s campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13 million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.[308]\n U.S. Secretary of State\n Main article: Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State\n See also: Foreign policy of Barack Obama\n Nomination and confirmation\n Hillary Clinton taking oath as Secretary of State on January 21, 2009.

Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.[314]\n The appointment required a Saxbe fix, passed and signed into law in December 2008.[315] Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before the Obama inauguration; two days later, the Committee voted 16–1 to approve Clinton.[316] By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65 percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal.[317] On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94–2.[318] Clinton took the oath of office of Secretary of State, resigning from the Senate later that day.[319] She became the first former first lady to serve in the United States Cabinet.[320]\n First half of tenure\n Obama whispering to Clinton at a summit meeting, with multiple soldiers in uniform standing behind them and heads of state sitting behind and in front of them.

Both of them are holding a “reset button”. They are in a room with a window to the left and an American flag behind them\n Clinton with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the “reset button”, March 2009\n In an internal debate regarding the war in Afghanistan during 2009, Clinton sided with the military’s recommendations for a maximal “Afghanistan surge”, recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal; she prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden’s opposition, but eventually supported Obama’s compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.[252][325] In March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a “reset button” symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[326][327] The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev’s time in office, but relations would worsen considerably following Vladimir Putin’s return to the position in 2012.[326] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton’s intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish–Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[328][329] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[183][l] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country’s nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[310][331][332]\n Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president.[333][334] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[335] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[310] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[334] moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon.[336][337] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.[310]\n Clinton greeting U.S. military personnel at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.

She is standing behind a blue podium with a sign that has the words “THE LONDON CONFERENCE ON LIBYA” printed in white-on-blue text in capital letters.\n The London meeting to discuss NATO military intervention in Libya, March 29, 2011\n As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton’s shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[344][345][346] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution and the State Department’s legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution’s 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[347] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called “convening power” to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[345] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state,[348] and the wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[349][350][351]\n During April 2011 internal deliberations of the president’s innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[352][353] Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden’s death, Clinton played a key role in the administration’s decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[354] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).[252][355]\n Clinton standing with Aung San Suu Kyi.

Everyone in the room is watching a live feed from drones operating over the Osama bin Laden complex.\n Throughout her time in office and in her final speech concluding it, Clinton viewed “smart power” as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values—in a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities—by combining military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy.[345][370] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.[371] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[252][335][355] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[372]\n Clinton greatly expanded the State Department’s use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, both to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-à-vis their governments.[345] And in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[185] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the “Hillary Doctrine”, she viewed women’s rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[333][373] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.[374]\n Clinton visited 112 countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[375][n] (Time magazine wrote that “Clinton’s endurance is legendary”).[345] The first secretary of state to visit countries such as Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[378] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as Secretary of State should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[346] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton’s successor.[365] Her last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013.[379] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton’s tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other Secretaries of State had,[336][337] and highlighted her focus on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.[380]\n Benghazi attack and subsequent hearings\n See also: 2012 Benghazi attack and United States House Select Committee on Benghazi\n Obama and Clinton at a somber occasion, honoring the Benghazi attack victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony, held at Andrews Air Force Base on September 14, 2012. There are soldiers standing behind Obama and Clinton, and everyone is standing on a large wooden floor with their left hands to their side and their right hands on their upper chests.\n Obama and Clinton honor the Benghazi attack victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony, held at Andrews Air Force Base on September 14, 2012\n On September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[381] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[381][382]\n On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[383] It focused its criticism on the department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[384] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[383]\n Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[385] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate “talking points” after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, “With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.”[385][386] In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration’s response to the attack.[387]\n Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015. She is standing behind a podium with a microphone, with many people behind her.\n Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015\n The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack.[388] Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics.[388][389] This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton’s poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans’ previous talking points on the investigation.[388][390] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[391][392] The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves.[391] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[393] The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines,[388] with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.[389]\n Email controversy\n Main article: Hillary Clinton email controversy\n A controversy arose in March 2015, when it was revealed by the State Department’s inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton’s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[394][395]\n In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and “never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.” They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[396] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[397] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called “born classified” category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[398] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton’s server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[399] Additionally, the intelligence community’s inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails “contained classified State Department information when originated.”[400] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[401]\n Clinton maintained that she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, “I never sent or received any classified material – they are retroactively classifying it.” On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: “Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.”[402][403]\n On July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said:\n 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were “up-classified” to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[399][404]\n Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small “c” in parentheses, described as “portion markings” by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not “technically sophisticated” enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.[404] The probe found that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI assessed that it “is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account.” Comey stated that although Clinton or her colleagues were “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information”, the FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that “no charges are appropriate in this case.”[399] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed that the probe into Clinton’s use of private email servers while secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges.[405]\n On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI started looking into newly discovered emails. Law enforcement officials stated while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered e-mails related to Clinton’s private server on a laptop computer belonging to Anthony Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its conclusion reached in July.[406] The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election.[407]\n Clinton Foundation and speeches\n Main article: Clinton Foundation\n Clinton standing behind lectern\n Clinton in September 2014\n When Clinton left the State Department, she became a private citizen for the first time in thirty years.[408] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[409] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[409][410]\n Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[411] its March 2015 report said that while “There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman … this data shows just how far we still have to go.”[412] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary.[o] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[415]\n She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[416] There she received $200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[416][417] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[416] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11 million from her speeches.[418] For the overall period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141 million, paid some $56 million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15 million to charity.[419] As of 2015, she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her own, or $45–53 million with her husband.[420]\n Clinton resigned from the foundation’s board in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign and the foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[o]\n 2016 presidential campaign\n  \n Clinton campaigning for president in Manchester, New Hampshire, in October 2016, with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (seated)\n Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016\n Further information: United States presidential election, 2016; Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016; and Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016\n On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[421] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure.[422] The campaign’s headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[423] Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act.[424][425] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[421] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton’s Wall Street ties.[417][425]\n In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders,[426][427] making her the first woman to win the Iowa caucuses.[426] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[428] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[429] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[430] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[429] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[429]\n On March 1 (“Super Tuesday”), Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[431] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[432][433][434]\n By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[435] On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[436] By campaign’s end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders’ 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders’ 47.[437] She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders’ 13 million.[438]\n  \n Bernie Sanders endorsing Clinton in New Hampshire, July 2016\n Clinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.[439] Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following day.[440] Her opponents in the general election were Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party.\n Clinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton became tied in major polls following the FBI’s conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[441] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her handling of classified government material.[442] In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention, in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it is toward the small side by historical standards.[443][444] Following Clinton’s 7 percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[445][446]\n Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016 presidential election.[447] By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win and media sources proclaimed him the winner.[448] Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave a victory speech.[449] The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying “We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.”[450] Though Clinton lost the election by only capturing 232 electors to Trump’s 306, a month after the election the popular vote count showed her leading by more than 2.7 million votes, with many votes yet to be counted.[451] She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.[452][453]\n On December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes instead being cast for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.[454]\n Clinton speaking behind a podium with a microphone in her hand.

The morning of the inauguration Clinton wrote on her Twitter account, “I’m here today to honor our democracy &amp; its enduring values, I will never stop believing in our country &amp; its future.”[455]\n On March 17, 2017 Clinton delivered a St. Patrick’s Day speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Making reference to reports of her being seen taking walks in woods around Chappaqua following her loss in the presidential election,[456][457] Clinton indicated her readiness to emerge from “the woods” and become politically active again.[456]\n In April 2017, Clinton commented that she will not seek public office again.[458]\n Clinton revealed Onward Together, a new political action committee that she wrote as being “dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election”, in a several tweets and an email in May 2017.[459]\n In a June 5, 2017 appearance at the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel, Clinton condemned the 2017 Portland train attack: “When violence motivated by hatred from, Portland, Oregon, to College Park, ends the lives of young Americans, this program’s mission of spreading tolerance is more urgent than ever.”[460] On June 14, after the Congressional baseball shooting, Clinton tweeted, “2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we’re all ultimately on one team. My thoughts are with the members of Congress, staff &amp; heroic police.”[461]\n Comments on President Trump\n On February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indians by Adam Purinton.[462] On April 6, in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Clinton said the US should take out the air fields of Bashar al-Assad and thereby “prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.”[463] On May 2, Clinton said Trump’s use of Twitter “doesn’t work” when pursuing important negotiations and North Korea should not be consulted with an abandoning “of a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table with some kind of realistic prospect for change.”[464] While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump’s 2018 budget proposal was “a con” for underfunding domestic programs.[465] During an appearance at Recode’s Code Conference on May 31, Clinton suggested Trump’s incomplete tweet from earlier in the day was “a hidden message to the Russians.”[466] The following day, after President Trump announced withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a “historic mistake.”[467]\n On March 24, 2017, after the postponing of a Congressional vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Clinton labeled the day “a victory for the 24,000,000 people at risk of losing their health insurance” and warned of an ongoing battle to maintain coverage.[468] Clinton went on to call the American Health Care Act “a disastrous bill” during a San Francisco speech four days later.[469] May 4, after the House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act, Clinton dubbed it a “shameful failure of policy &amp; morality by GOP”.[470] On June 23, the day after Senate Republicans revealed a draft of their healthcare reform legislation, Clinton tweeted, “This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics. Speak out against this bill.”[471]\n Political positions\n Main article: Political positions of Hillary Clinton\n Secretary of State Clinton meets with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Clinton is in favor of maintaining U.S. influence in the Middle East.\n Several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton’s place on the political spectrum scientifically using her Senate votes. National Journal’s 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[472] National Journal’s subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[473] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her to be likely the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[474] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75 liberal, 23 conservative; Social = 83 liberal, 6 conservative; Foreign = 66 liberal, 30 conservative. Total average = 75 liberal, 20 conservative.[p] According to FiveThirtyEight’s measure of political ideology, “Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.”[475]\n Organizations have also attempted to give newer assessments of Clinton once she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in their “Left Liberal” region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances and an economic score of 10 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[476] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[477] Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90 percent “Liberal Quotient” from Americans for Democratic Action,[478] and a lifetime 8 percent rating from the American Conservative Union.[479]\n In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called “optimistic” and “wide-ranging”. Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a “clawback” that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an “exit tax” on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[480] Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as “the gold standard”[481] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that “any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security”.[482][483] As Senator (2001–2009), her record on trade was mixed, voting in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[482]\n Given the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit “unaccountable money” in politics.[484] In July 2016, she “committed” to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.[485][486] On December 7, 2015, in The New York Times, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities.[487]\n Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign logo, a large blue letter “H” with a red arrow facing right, overlaying the horizontal bar of the “H”. The head of the arrow is also overlaid over the right vertical bar of the “H”, with two small blue triangles poking out where the bar of the “H” is not covered by the arrow.\n Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign logo\n Clinton accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, supports cap-and-trade,[488] and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline.[489]\n She supported “equal pay for equal work,” to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do.[490] Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool.[484] These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a “fair share surcharge”.[491]\n Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act[492] and would have added a “public option” that would have competed against private insurers and enabled people “50 or 55 and up” to buy into Medicare.[493][494]\n On LGBT rights, she supported the right to same-sex marriage.[484] Clinton first expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage in 2013; in 2000, she had been against such unions altogether and in 2006, she said only that she would support a state’s decision to permit same-sex marriages.[495] In 2000, she was the first First Lady to march in an LGBT pride parade.[496] In 2016, she was the first major-party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News).[497]\n Clinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship “[i]s at its heart a family issue”,[498] and expressed support for Obama’s Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States.[499][500] She opposed and criticized Trump’s call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[501]\n Clinton expressed support for Common Core.[502] She said, “The really unfortunate argument that’s been going on around Common Core, it’s very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn’t politicized…. Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven’t had that and so don’t understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.”[503]\n On foreign affairs, Clinton voted in October 2002 in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq,[504] a vote she later “regretted.”[505] She favored arming Syria’s rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[506] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[507][508] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[501] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, “America can’t ever be neutral when it comes to Israel’s security and survival.”[509] Clinton expressed support for Israel’s right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[510][511] In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields.[512]\n In 2000, Clinton advocated for eliminating the electoral college[513] and promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it resulting in the direct election of the president.[514][515]\n Religious views\n Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church:\n First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge, Illinois—in her early life,\n First United Methodist Church of Little Rock, Arkansas—while in Arkansas,\n Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C.—as First Lady of the United States,\n Metropolitan Community United Methodist Church in New York, New York—currently a congregant.\n She discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.[516] However, she has infrequently discussed her faith while campaigning.[517][518] Clinton has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one’s neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and “creating opportunities for others to be lifted up”.[518] Clinton has also expressed disappointment that “Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.”[518]\n Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has suggested that Clinton’s political positions are rooted in her faith. Clinton often expresses a certain maxim which is often attributed to John Wesley: “Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.”[517] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy “made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith.”[519]\n Writings and recordings\n See also: Bibliography of Hillary Clinton\n External video\n Booknotes interview with Clinton about It Takes a Village, March 3, 1996, C-SPAN\n Informal pose of Clinton, in which she is wearing a beige wool jacket and facing toward the right. The angle at which Clinton is photographed is from her bottom right side.\n Clinton in February 2011\n As First Lady of the United States, Clinton published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled “Talking It Over” from 1995 to 2000.[520][521] It focused on her experiences and those of women, children and families she met during her travels around the world.[5]\n In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for the children of America in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. The book made the Best Seller list of The New York Times and Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book’s audio recording.[522] She was the first First Lady to win a Grammy Award.[523]\n Other books published by Clinton when she was first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids’ Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children’s book Beatrice’s Goat.[524]\n In 2003, Clinton released a 562-page autobiography, Living History, for which publisher Simon &amp; Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8 million.[525] The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[526] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[527] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[528] Clinton’s audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[529]\n In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as Secretary of State. As of July 2015, the book has sold about 280,000 copies.[530]\n In 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States if they had won the 2016 presidential election.[531]\n Clinton authored her third memoir, What Happened, about the 2016 election, which was released on September 12, 2017, by Simon &amp; Schuster, in print, e-book, and audio read by the author.[532] A book tour and series of interviews and personal appearances were arranged for the launch.[533]\n Cultural and political image\n Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton, from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found “a virtual cottage industry” of “anti-Clinton literature”, put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints, with titles such as Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary’s Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton’s Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless … Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[534] (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[535] Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable “bogeyman” to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[536]\n Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture from a wide spectrum of varying perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[537] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, “Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.”[538] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as first lady and has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers.[539][540] Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her, including but not limited to “The Hillary Shimmy Song”, which went viral.[541][542][543][544]\n A three-story, red brick building in Arkansas. The Rose Law Firm is located inside this building. Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years.\n Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years. Her professional career and political involvement set the stage for public reaction to her as first lady.\n Clinton has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, with some arguing otherwise.[545] James Madison University political science professor Valerie Sulfaro’s 2007 study used the American National Election Studies’ “feeling thermometer” polls, which measure the degree of opinion about a political figure, to find that such polls during Clinton’s first lady years confirm the “conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure”, with the added insight that “affect towards Mrs. Clinton as first lady tended to be very positive or very negative, with a fairly constant one fourth of respondents feeling ambivalent or neutral”.[546] University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson’s 2006 study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state’s senators, Clinton had the fourth-largest partisan difference of any senator, with a 50-percentage-point difference in approval between New York’s Democrats and Republicans.[547]\n Northern Illinois University political science professor Barbara Burrell’s 2000 study found that Clinton’s Gallup poll favorability numbers broke sharply along partisan lines throughout her time as first lady, with 70 to 90 percent of Democrats typically viewing her favorably while only 20 to 40 percent of Republicans did.[548] University of Wisconsin–Madison political science professor Charles Franklin analyzed her record of favorable versus unfavorable ratings in public opinion polls and found that there was more variation in them during her first lady years than her Senate years. The Senate years showed favorable ratings around 50 percent and unfavorable ratings in the mid-40 percent range; Franklin noted that, “This sharp split is, of course, one of the more widely remarked aspects of Sen. Clinton’s public image.”[549] McGill University professor of history Gil Troy titled his 2006 biography of her Hillary Rodham Clinton: Polarizing First Lady and wrote that after the 1992 campaign, Clinton “was a polarizing figure, with 42 percent [of the public] saying she came closer to their values and lifestyle than previous first ladies and 41 percent disagreeing.”[550] Troy further wrote that Clinton “has been uniquely controversial and contradictory since she first appeared on the national radar screen in 1992” and that she “has alternately fascinated, bedeviled, bewitched and appalled Americans.”[551]\n Line chart showing Clinton’s favorability rankings from 1992 to 2016. The ratings show her as a controversial first lady whose ratings hit a low following the Hillarycare failure and a high following the Lewinsky scandal. Opinion about her was closely divided during her 2000 Senate campaign, mildly positive during her time as a senator, and then closely divided again during her 2008 presidential campaign. As secretary of state, she enjoyed widespread approval, before dipping as her tenure ended and then to some of her lowest ratings ever as she became viewed as a presidential candidate again.\n Clinton’s Gallup Poll favorable and unfavorable ratings, 1992–2016.[552]\n The ratings show her as a controversial first lady whose ratings hit a low following the Hillarycare failure and a high following the Lewinsky scandal.

As secretary of state, she enjoyed widespread approval, before dipping as her tenure ended and then to some of her lowest ratings ever as she became viewed as a presidential candidate again.[553]\n Burrell’s study found women consistently rating Clinton more favorably than men by about ten percentage points during her first lady years.[548] Jacobson’s study found a positive correlation across all senators between being women and receiving a partisan-polarized response.[547] Colorado State University communication studies professor Karrin Vasby Anderson describes the first lady position as a “site” for American womanhood, one ready made for the symbolic negotiation of female identity.[554] In particular anderson states there has been a cultural bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against modern first ladies; by the time of Clinton, the first lady position had become a site of heterogeneity and paradox.[554] Burrell, as well as biographers Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., note that Clinton achieved her highest approval ratings as first lady late in 1998, not for professional or political achievements of her own, but for being seen as the victim of her husband’s very public infidelity.[215][548] University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson saw Clinton as an exemplar of the double bind, who though able to live in a “both-and” world of both career and family, nevertheless “became a surrogate on whom we projected our attitudes about attributes once thought incompatible”, leading to her being placed in a variety of no-win situations.[538] Quinnipiac University media studies professor Lisa Burns found press accounts frequently framing Clinton both as an exemplar of the modern professional working mother and as a political interloper interested in usurping power for herself.[555] University of Indianapolis English professor Charlotte Templin found political cartoonists using a variety of stereotypes—such as gender reversal, radical feminist as emasculator and the wife the husband wants to get rid of—to portray Clinton as violating gender norms.[556]\n Side profile of Clinton facing toward her right side. She is speaking into a microphone.\n Clinton in 2009\n Going into the early stages of her presidential campaign for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled “Love Her”, “Hate Her”,[557] while Mother Jones titled its profile of her “Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary”.[558] Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates,[559] while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all.[560][561] An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled “The Waning Power of Hillary Hate”.[562] By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation.[563] She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton’s laugh,[564] that “We know that there’s language to condemn female speech that doesn’t exist for male speech. We call women’s speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton’s laugh was being described as a cackle.”[563] The “bitch” epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics,[565] flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well.[566] Following Clinton’s “choked up moment” and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender’s role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[567][568] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events “brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades … she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics.”[568]\n Hillary Clinton dressed in a black suit and a green shirt, sitting in a café. She is smiling, and a red teacup is situated in front of her. The foreground is distorted due to the presence of various small objects.\n Clinton in April 2015\n Once she became Secretary of State, Clinton’s image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.[333][569] She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal),[570] and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure.[569][571] A 2012 Internet meme, “Texts from Hillary”, was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics.[572] Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, “There’s a certain consistency to who I am and what I do and I think people have finally said, ‘Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'”[333] She continued to do well in Gallup’s most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.[573]\n Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[574] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[575] During 2016 she acknowledged that: “I’m not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed.”[576] In July 2017 Bloomberg showed her approval rating at 39 percent.[577]\n Electoral history\n Main article: Electoral history of Hillary Clinton\n New York United States Senate election, 2000\n Party Candidate Votes % ±\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 3,747,310 55.3\n Republican Rick Lazio 2,915,730 43.0\n New York United States Senate election, 2006\n Party Candidate Votes % ±\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 3,008,428 67.0 +11.7\n Republican John Spencer 1,392,189 31.0 −12.0\n Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008\n Party Candidate Votes %\n Democratic Barack Obama 17,584,692 (popular votes)\n 2,272.5 delegates\n (33 states) 47.3% of popular vote\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 17,857,501 (popular votes)\n 1,978 delegates\n (23 states) 48.0% of popular vote\n Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016\n Party Candidate Votes %\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 16,914,722 (popular votes)\n 2,842 delegates\n (34 states) 55.2% of popular vote\n Democratic Bernie Sanders 13,206,428 (popular votes)\n 1,865 delegates\n (23 states) 43.1% of popular vote\n United States presidential election, 2016\n Party Candidate Votes %\n Republican Donald Trump 62,979,879 (popular votes)\n 304 electors\n (30 states + ME-02) 46.0% (popular vote)\n 56.5% (electoral vote)\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 65,844,954 (popular votes)\n 227 electors\n (20 states + DC) 48.1% (popular vote)\n 42.2% (electoral vote)\n – Aryan Yadav\n CEO and Founder                          \n \n     Donald Trump  October 27, 2017October 27, 2017 / The Aryan Yadav Foundation (ARYF)  / Leave a comment \n    Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current President of the United States, in office since January 20, 2017.

He earned an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. A third-generation businessman, Trump followed in the footsteps of his grandmother Elizabeth and father Fred in running the family real estate company. He served as chairman and president of The Trump Organization from 1971 until his inauguration as president in January 2017, when he delegated company management to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric. Trump’s business career primarily focused on building or renovating office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses, such as Trump Tower and Trump Taj Mahal.\n Trump also started several side ventures and branded various products with his name. He is credited as having written or co-written several books (including The Art of the Deal), and produced and hosted The Apprentice television series for 12 years. As of 2017, he was the 544th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion.\n Trump had long expressed interest in politics. He entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. His campaign received extensive free media coverage; many of his public statements were controversial or false. Trump won the general election on November 8, 2016, in a surprise victory against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election despite losing the popular vote. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests.\n In domestic policy, Trump has unsuccessfully attempted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He appointed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He ordered a travel ban on citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; the ban was partially implemented after several legal challenges. In foreign policy, he withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Agreement, undid parts of the Cuban Thaw, and ordered missile strikes in Syria in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack. After Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, the Justice Department appointed Comey’s predecessor Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate Russia’s interference in the presidential election, potential links between Russia and Trump campaign associates, and any related matters.\n Contents\n Family and personal life\n Ancestry\n Further information: Trump family\n Trump’s ancestors originated from the German village of Kallstadt, Palatinate, on his father’s side, and from the Outer Hebrides isles of Scotland on his mother’s side. All his grandparents, and his mother, were born in Europe. His mother’s grandfather was also christened “Donald”.[2]\n Trump’s paternal grandfather, Friedrich Trump, first emigrated to the United States in 1885 at the age of 16, and became a citizen in 1892. He amassed a fortune operating boom-town restaurants and boarding houses in the Seattle area and the Klondike region of Canada during the gold rush.[3] On a visit to Kallstadt, he met Elisabeth Christ and married her in 1902. The couple settled in New York permanently in 1905.[4] Frederick died from influenza during the 1918 pandemic.[5]\n Donald’s father, Fred Trump, was born in 1905 in the Bronx. Fred started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15, shortly after his father’s death. Their company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, was primarily active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. Fred eventually built and sold thousands of houses, barracks and apartments.[5][6] The company would later become The Trump Organization after Donald Trump took over in 1971.[7]\n Donald’s mother, Mary Anne, was born in Tong, Lewis, Scotland. At age 18 in 1930, she emigrated to New York, where she worked as a maid.[8] Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens.[8][9]\n Donald’s uncle John Trump was an electrical engineer, physicist, and inventor. He was also a professor at MIT from 1936 to 1973. During World War II, he was involved in radar research for the Allies and helped design X-ray machines that were used to treat cancer.[10]\n Early life and education\n A black-and-white photograph of Donald Trump as a teenager, smiling and wearing a dark pseudo-military uniform with various badges and a light-colored stripe crossing his right shoulder. This image was taken while Trump was in the New York Military Academy in 1964.\n Senior yearbook photo of Trump in 1964 wearing the uniform of his private boarding school, New York Military Academy[11][12]\n Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Queens, New York City. He was the fourth of five children born to Frederick Trump (1905–1999) and Mary Anne Trump (née MacLeod, 1912–2000).[13] His siblings are Maryanne (b. 1937), Fred Jr. (1938–1981), Elizabeth (b. 1942), and Robert (b. 1948).\n Trump grew up in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens. He attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade. At age 13, he enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, after his parents discovered that he had made frequent trips into Manhattan without their permission.[14][15]\n In August 1964, Trump began his higher education at Fordham University.[11][16] After two years, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, because it offered one of the few real-estate studies departments in United States academia at the time.[16][17]\n In addition to his father, Trump was inspired by Manhattan developer William Zeckendorf, vowing to be “even bigger and better”.[18] While at Wharton, he worked at the family business, Elizabeth Trump and Son,[19] graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.[16][20][21]\n Trump was not drafted during the Vietnam War, and he did not enlist either as a volunteer or as a Reserve Officer Training Corps candidate.[22] While Trump was in college from 1964 to 1968, he obtained four student deferments.[23] In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a military medical examination, and in 1968 was briefly classified as fit by a local draft board. In October of that year, he was given a 1-Y medical deferment,[24] which was attributed to heel spurs.[25] In 1969, he received a high number in the draft lottery, which gave him a low probabilty to be called to military service.[24][26][27]\n Family\n Main article: Family of Donald Trump\n Donald Trump is sworn-in as President on January 20, 2017: Trump, wife Melania, son Donald Jr., son Barron, daughter Ivanka, son Eric, and daughter Tiffany\n Trump has five children by three marriages, as well as nine grandchildren.[28][29] His first two marriages ended in widely publicized divorces.[30]\n Trump was 30 years old when he married his first wife, Czech model Ivana Zelníčková, on April 7, 1977, at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan in a ceremony performed by the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale.[31][32] They had three children: son Donald Jr. (b. 1977), daughter Ivanka (b. 1981), and son Eric (b. 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[33] The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump’s affair with actress Marla Maples.[34]\n In October 1993, Maples gave birth to Trump’s daughter, who was named Tiffany after high-end retailer Tiffany &amp; Company.[35] Maples and Trump were married two months later on December 20, 1993.[36] They divorced in 1999,[37] and Tiffany was raised by Marla in California.[38]\n  \n The President and First Lady at the Liberty Ball on Inauguration Day\n On January 22, 2005, Trump married his third wife, Slovenian model Melania Knauss, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida. The ceremony was followed by a reception at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.[39] In 2006, Melania acquired United States citizenship[40] and on March 20 of that year, she gave birth to a son whom they named Barron.[41][42] Melania became First Lady of the United States upon Trump’s inauguration as the nation’s 45th President in January 2017.[43]\n Upon his inauguration as president, Trump delegated the management of his real estate business to his two adult sons, Eric and Don Jr.[44] His daughter Ivanka resigned from The Trump Organization and moved to Washington with her husband Jared Kushner. She serves as an assistant to the president,[45] and he is a Senior Advisor in the White House.[46]\n Trump’s elder sister, Maryanne Barry, is an inactive Federal Appeals Court judge on the Third Circuit.[47]\n Religion\n Trump’s ancestors were Lutheran on his father’s side in Germany[48] and Presbyterian on his mother’s side in Scotland.[49] His parents married in a Manhattan Presbyterian church in 1936.[50] As a child, he attended the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, and had his Confirmation there.[32] In the 1970s, his family joined the Marble Collegiate Church (an affiliate of the Reformed Church in America) in Manhattan.[51] The pastor at that church, Norman Vincent Peale, author of The Power of Positive Thinking and The Art of Living, ministered to Trump’s family and mentored him until Peale’s death in 1993.[52][51] Trump, who is Presbyterian,[53][54] has cited Peale and his works during interviews when asked about the role of religion in his personal life.[51]\n Trump receives Holy Communion, but he has said that he does not ask God for forgiveness. He stated: “I think if I do something wrong, I just try and make it right. I don’t bring God into that picture.”[55] On the campaign trail, Trump has referred to The Art of the Deal as his second favorite book after the Bible, saying, “Nothing beats the Bible.”[56] In a 2016 speech to Liberty University, he referred to “2 Corinthians” (pronounced “Second Corinthians”) as “Two Corinthians”, eliciting chuckles from the audience.[57][58] The New York Times reported that Evangelical Christians nationwide thought “that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure”.[59]\n Trump has had associations with a number of Christian spiritual leaders, including Florida pastor Paula White, who has been called his “closest spiritual confidant.”[60] In 2015, he received a blessing from Greek Orthodox priest Emmanuel Lemelson[61] and in 2016, he released a list of his religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed and others.[62] Referring to his daughter Ivanka’s conversion to Judaism before her marriage to Jared Kushner, Trump said: “I have a Jewish daughter; and I am very honored by that.”[63]\n Health\n Trump’s physician, Harold Bornstein, issued a 2016 medical report that showed Trump’s blood pressure and liver and thyroid function to be in normal ranges.[64][65] He is overweight and takes statins to lower his cholesterol.[65] Trump has said that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed drugs, including marijuana.[66] He also drinks no alcohol; this decision arose in part from watching his older brother Fred Jr. suffer from alcoholism that contributed to his early death in 1981.[67][68]\n Wealth\n Trump said that he began his career with “a small loan of one million dollars” from his father.[69] He appeared on the initial Forbes List of wealthy individuals in 1982 with an estimated $200 million fortune, including an “undefined” share of his parents’ estate.[70] During the 1980s he became a billionaire,[71] but he was absent from the Forbes list following business losses from 1990 to 1995; he reportedly borrowed from his siblings’ trusts in 1993.[70] His father’s estate, valued at more than $20 million, was divided in 1999 among Trump, his three surviving siblings and their children.[72][73]\n A tall rectangular-shaped tower in Las Vegas with exterior windows reflecting a golden hue.

Trump valued his “properties under development” at $293 million; Forbes said they could not evaluate those deals, and booked them for $0.[80][81] Trump’s 2015 FEC disclosure reported $362 million in total income for the year 2014.[77]\n After Trump made controversial remarks about illegal immigrants in 2015, he lost business contracts with several companies; this reduced his Forbes estimate by $125 million.[82] Consumer boycotts and reduced bookings may have further affected his brand value during the presidential campaign.[83][84][85] Trump’s 104-page FEC disclosure in May 2016[86] still claimed a total wealth over $10 billion, unchanged from 2015.[76] The release of the Access Hollywood tapes in October 2016 put further pressure on his brand,[87] but real estate experts predicted a positive rebound after he was elected.[88]\n In its 2017 billionaires’ ranking, Forbes estimated Trump’s net worth at $3.5 billion (544th in the world, 201st in the U.S.)[1] making him one of the richest politicians in American history. These estimates fluctuate from year to year, and among various analysts. In July 2016 Bloomberg News had pegged his wealth at $3 billion, calling it an increase thanks to his presidential nomination,[89] whereas Forbes had ranked him 324th in the world (113th in the U.S.) with $4.5 billion just a few months earlier.[90] The discrepancies among these estimates and with Trump’s own figures stem from the uncertain values of appraised property and of his personal brand.[89][91]\n Business career\n Main article: Business career of Donald Trump\n Real estate\n The distinctive façade of Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan\n Trump started his career at his father’s real estate development company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, which focused on middle-class rental housing in New York City’s outer boroughs, but also had business elsewhere.[92] For example, during his undergraduate study, Trump joined his father Fred in successfully revitalizing the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, thereby boosting the occupancy rate from 66% to 100%.[93][94]\n When his father became chairman of the board in 1971, Trump was promoted to president of the company and renamed it The Trump Organization.[7][95] In 1973, he and his father drew wider attention when the Justice Department contended that the organization systematically discriminated against African Americans wishing to rent apartments rather than merely screening out people based on low income as the Trumps stated. Under an agreement reached in 1975, the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing, and made the Urban League an intermediary for qualified minority applicants.[96][97] His adviser and attorney during (and after) that period was Roy Cohn, who responded to attacks by counterattacking with maximum force, and who valued both positive and negative publicity, which were attitudes that Trump appreciated.[98]\n Manhattan developments\n In 1978, Trump consummated his first major real estate deal in Manhattan when he purchased a half-share in the decrepit Commodore Hotel. The purchase was largely funded by a $70 million construction loan that was jointly guaranteed by Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain. Designed by architect Der Scutt, the project was able to proceed by leveraging competing interests and by taking advantage of tax breaks.[99] After remodeling, the hotel reopened as the Grand Hyatt Hotel, located next to Grand Central Terminal.[100][101]\n Also in 1978, Trump finished negotiations to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 202-meter (663-foot) skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, which The New York Times attributed to his “persistence” and “skills as a negotiator”.[102] To make way for the new building, a crew of undocumented Polish workers demolished an old Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features that had initially been marked for preservation.[103] The building was completed in 1983 and houses both the primary penthouse condominium residence of Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization.[104][105] Architectural critic Paul Goldberger said in 1983 that he was surprised to find the tower’s atrium was “the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years”.[106][107] Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television show The Apprentice and includes a fully functional television studio set.[108]\n  \n Central Park’s Wollman Rink after the Trump renovation\n Repairs on Central Park’s Wollman Rink were started in 1980 by a general contractor who was unconnected to Trump. Despite an expected two and one-half year construction schedule, the repairs were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $1.95 million, $775,000 less than the initial budget, and operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity in exchange for the rink’s concession rights.[109]\n In 1988 Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for a record-setting $407 million and asked his wife Ivana to manage its operation.[110] Trump invested $50 million to restore the building, which he called “the Mona Lisa”.[111] According to hotel expert Thomas McConnell, the Trumps boosted it from a three-star to a four-star ranking and sold it in 1995, by which time Ivana was no longer involved.[112]\n In 1994, Trump became involved with a building on Columbus Circle that was swaying in the wind. He began a reconstruction project that stopped the swaying and gave the building a full makeover.[113][114] Trump thereafter owned commercial space in that 44-story mixed-use tower (hotel and condominium), which he named Trump International Hotel and Tower.[115]\n In 1996, Trump acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street that had briefly been the tallest building in the world when it was completed in 1930. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street.[116]\n In 1997, he began construction on Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. The project encountered delays the following year because a subcontracter had to replace defective concrete.[117][118] He and the other investors in the project ultimately sold their interest for $1.8 billion in 2005 in what was then the biggest residential sale in the history of New York City.[119]\n From 1994 to 2002, Trump owned a 50% share of the Empire State Building. He would have renamed it “Trump Empire State Building Tower Apartments” if he had been able to boost his share.[120][121]\n In 2001, Trump completed Trump World Tower, which was across from the headquarters of the United Nations. For a while, the structure was the tallest all-residential tower in the world.[122] In 2002, Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue; the building consisted of 35 stories of luxury condominiums.[123] Meanwhile, he continued to own millions of square feet of other prime Manhattan real estate.[124]\n Palm Beach estate\n Main article: Mar-a-Lago\n Mar-a-Lago in 2009\n The Trumps with Chinese President Xi Jinping and wife at Mar-a-Lago in 2017\n In 1985, Trump acquired the historic Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida for $5 million plus $3 million for the home’s furnishings. The home was built in the 1920s by heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post, who envisioned the house as a future winter retreat for American presidents.\n Trump’s initial offer of $28 million had been rejected, and he was able to get the property at the much lower price by purchasing separate beachfront property and threatening to build a house on it that would block Mar-a-Lago’s ocean view. In addition to using the estate as a home, Trump also turned it into a private club open to everyone who could afford the initiation fee of $100,000 plus annual dues.[125]\n In 1986, Trump acquired a foreclosed 33-story, twin-tower condominium complex in nearby West Palm Beach for $40 million. Auto CEO Lee Iacocca invested in three of the condos.[126] Trump spruced up the complex’s public areas and heavily promoted the property for years, but selling the units proved difficult, and the deal turned out to be unprofitable.[127]\n Atlantic City casinos\n New Jersey legalized casino gambling in 1977, and the following year Trump was in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to explore how he might get involved in a new business venture. Seven years later, Harrah’s at Trump Plaza hotel and casino opened there; the multi-use unit was built by Trump with financing from Holiday Corporation, which also was managing that business.[128] Renamed “Trump Plaza” soon after opening, it was at that time the tallest building in Atlantic City.[129] The casino’s poor financial results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp., which led to Trump’s paying $70 million in May 1986 to buy out their interest in the property.[130][131] Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320 million; when completed in 1985, that hotel and casino became Trump Castle, and Trump’s wife, Ivana, managed that property until Trump transferred her in 1988 to run the Trump Plaza Hotel in New York.[132][133]\n The entrance of the Trump Taj Mahal, a casino in Atlantic City. It has motifs evocative of the Taj Mahal in India.\n Entrance of the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City\n Also in 1988, Trump acquired his third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal (then halfway through construction), by making a complex transaction with the television host and entertainer Merv Griffin as well as the resort and casino company Resorts International.[134] In October 1989, three of his top Atlantic City executives were killed in a helicopter accident, which both stymied and delayed the planned opening of the Taj Mahal.[135] The Taj finally opened in April 1990 and was built at a total cost of $1.1 billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever.[136][137] The project was financed with $675 million in junk bonds[138] and was a major gamble by Trump.[139] The project underwent debt restructuring the following year,[140] leaving Trump with 50% ownership.[141] He also sold his 282-foot (86 m) megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers.[142][143]\n In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana.[144] THCR purchased Taj Mahal in 1996 and underwent bankruptcy restructuring in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[145] From mid 1995 until early 2009, he served as chairman of the publicly-traded THCR organization—which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts—and served as CEO from mid 2000 to mid 2005.[146]\n During the 1990s, Trump’s casino ventures faced competition from Native American gaming at the Foxwoods casino located on an Indian reservation in Connecticut, where it was exempt from the state’s anti-gambling laws. Trump stated in 1993 that the casino owners did not look like real Indians to him or to other Indians.[147] Subsequent to that well-publicized remark about the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, Trump became a key investor backing the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots, who were also seeking state recognition.[148]\n Golf courses\n A golf course. In the background is the Turnberry Hotel, a two-story hotel with white façade and a red roof. This picture was taken in Ayrshire, Scotland.\n Turnberry Hotel and golf course, Ayrshire, Scotland\n The Trump Organization operates many golf courses and resorts in the United States and around the world. According to Golfweek, Trump owns or manages about 18 golf courses.[149] His personal financial disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission stated that his golf and resort revenue for the year 2015 was roughly $382 million,[76][86] while his three European golf courses did not show a profit.[89]\n In 2006, Trump bought 1,400 acres (570 ha), including the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and created a golf resort there.[150] Scottish supporters emphasized potential economic benefits, and opponents emphasized potential environmental harm to a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).[151][152][153] A spokesperson for the golf course has said 95% of the SSSI is untouched.[154] A 2011 independent documentary, You’ve Been Trumped, chronicled the golf resort’s construction and struggles.[155] In 2015, an offshore windfarm being built within sight of the golf course prompted a legal challenge by Trump, which was dismissed by the U.K. Supreme Court.[156] In the wake of the 2008 recession, Trump greatly scaled back development of this property, and as of December 2016 Scottish officials were pushing for completion of the far larger development as originally approved.[157]\n In April 2014, Trump purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland, which hosted the Open Championship four times between 1977 and 2009.[158][159] After extensive renovations and a remodeling of the course by golf architect Martin Ebert, Turnberry was re-opened in June 2016.[160]\n Hotels outside New York\n Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago\n Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver\n In the late 2000s and early 2010s, The Trump Organization expanded its footprint in the United States beyond New York and into a few other countries with the co-development and management of hotel towers in Chicago, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., Panama City, Toronto, and Vancouver. There are also Trump-branded buildings in Dubai, Honolulu, Istanbul, Manila, Mumbai and in Indonesia.[161]\n Branding and licensing\n Main article: List of things named after Donald Trump\n Trump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies. He has also licensed his name for various commercial products and services. In doing so, he achieved mixed success for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects.[162] In 2011, Forbes’ financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3 billion.[163]\n Legal affairs and bankruptcies\n Main article: Legal affairs of Donald Trump\n As of 2016, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 3,500 state and federal legal actions. He or one of his companies was the plaintiff in 1,900 cases and the defendant in 1,450. With Trump or his company as plaintiff, more than half the cases have been against gamblers at his casinos who had failed to pay off their debts. With Trump or his company as a defendant, the most common type of case involved personal injury cases at his hotels. In cases where there was a clear resolution, Trump’s side won 451 times and lost 38.[164][165]\n Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, but his hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[166][167] Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, “I do play with the bankruptcy laws – they’re very good for me” as a tool for trimming debt.[168][169]\n The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[170][171] Trump said, “I’ve used the laws of this country to pare debt … We’ll have the company. We’ll throw it into a chapter. We’ll negotiate with the banks. We’ll make a fantastic deal. You know, it’s like on The Apprentice. It’s not personal. It’s just business.”[140]\n A 2016 analysis of Trump’s business career by The Economist concluded that his “… performance [from 1985 to 2016] has been mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York”, noting both his successes and bankruptcies.[172] A subsequent analysis by The Washington Post concluded that “Trump is a mix of braggadocio, business failures, and real success”, calling his casino bankruptcies the “most infamous flop” of his business career.[173]\n Side ventures\n After Trump took charge of the family real estate firm in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization, he not only greatly expanded its real estate operations, but also ventured into numerous other business activities. The company eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.[174]\n Sports events\n In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals—an American football team that played in the United States Football League (USFL)—from oil magnate J. Walter Duncan. The USFL played three seasons during the spring and summer. After the 1985 season, the organization folded due to continuous financial difficulties, despite winning an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL.[175]\n Trump remained involved with other sports after the Generals folded; he operated golf courses in several countries.[175] At the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, he hosted several boxing matches, which included Mike Tyson’s 1988 heavyweight championship fight against Michael Spinks.[176] He also acted as a financial advisor to Mike Tyson.[177] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d’Italia.[178]\n Miss Universe\n Main articles: Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA\n From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe pageants.[179][180] The Miss Universe Pageants include Miss USA and Miss Teen USA, and his management of this business involved his family members; for example, daughter Ivanka once hosted Miss Teen USA. Trump hired the first female president of the Miss Universe business in 1997.[181] He became dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled the pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002.[182][183]\n In his 2015 U.S. presidential campaign kickoff speech, Trump made statements about illegal immigrants who crossed the border from Mexico. NBC then decided to end its business relationship with him and stated that it would no longer air the Miss Universe or Miss USA pageants on its networks.[184] In September 2015, Trump bought NBC’s share of the Miss Universe Organization and became its sole owner for three days. He then sold the entire company to the WME/IMG talent agency.[185]\n Trump University\n Main article: Trump University\n Trump University was a for-profit education company that was founded by Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny. The company ran a real estate training program and charged between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[186][187][188] In 2005, the operation was notified by New York State authorities that its use of the word “university” was misleading and violated state law. After a second such notification in 2010, the name of the company was changed to the “Trump Entrepreneurial Institute”.[189] Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[190]\n In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit alleging that Trump University made false statements and defrauded consumers.[189][191] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court relating to Trump University; they named Trump personally as well as his companies.[192] During the presidential campaign, Trump criticized Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel who oversaw those two cases, alleging bias in his rulings because of his Mexican heritage.[193][194] Shortly after Trump won the presidency, the parties agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases, whereby Trump paid a total of $25 million and denied any wrongdoing.[195][196]\n Foundation\n Main article: Donald J. Trump Foundation\n The Donald J. Trump Foundation is a U.S.-based private foundation[197] established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal by Trump and Tony Schwartz.[198][199] The foundation’s funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump,[200] who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.[200]\n The foundation’s tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[201] In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York–Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000).[202][203] From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5 million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007.[200] Linda McMahon later became Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[204]\n In 2016, investigations by The Washington Post uncovered several potential legal and ethical violations conducted by the charity, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[205] After beginning an investigation into the foundation, the New York State Attorney General’s office notified the Trump Foundation that it was allegedly in violation of New York laws regarding charities, and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[206][207][208] A Trump spokesman called the investigation a “partisan hit job”.[206] In response to mounting complaints, Trump’s team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove “even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President.”[209]\n Resignation\n When Trump was elected president of the United States in November 2016, questions arose over how he would avoid conflicts of interest between his work in the White House and his business activities. At a press conference on January 10, 2017, Trump said that he and his daughter Ivanka would resign all roles with The Trump Organization, while his two adult sons Don Jr. and Eric would run the business, together with Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg.[210]\n Trump retained his financial stake in the business.[211] His attorney Sherri Dillon said that before the January 20 inauguration, Trump would put those business assets into a trust, which would hire an ethics advisor and a compliance counsel. She added that The Trump Organization would not enter any new foreign business deals, while continuing to pursue domestic opportunities.[212] As of April 2017, Trump companies owned more than 400 condo units and home lots in the United States, valued at over $250 million in total ($200,000 to $35 million each).[213]\n Media career\n The Apprentice\n Main articles: The Apprentice (U.S. TV series) and The Apprentice (TV series)\n Donald Trump posing with former basketball player Dennis Rodman in a room with paintings adorning the walls. Trump is wearing a suit with a light-colored tie and dress shirt, while Rodman is wearing a brown T-shirt with a design on it, blue jeans, and a baseball cap that also has a design on it.\n Trump posing with former NBA basketball player Dennis Rodman during Rodman’s 2009 participation on Celebrity Apprentice\n In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show The Apprentice, in which a group of competitors battled for a high-level management job in one of Trump’s commercial enterprises. Contestants were successively “fired” and eliminated from the game. For the first year of the show, Trump earned $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show’s initial success, he was paid $1 million per episode.[214] In a July 2015 press release, Trump’s campaign manager said that NBCUniversal had paid him $213,606,575 for his 14 seasons hosting the show,[77] although the network did not verify the statement.[215] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to television on The Apprentice.[162][216]\n Along with British TV producer Mark Burnett, Trump was hired as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities compete to win money for their charities. While Trump and Burnett co-produced the show, Trump stayed in the forefront, deciding winners and “firing” losers. International versions of The Apprentice franchise were co-produced by Burnett and Trump.\n On February 16, 2015, NBC announced that they would be renewing The Apprentice for a 15th season.[217] On February 27, Trump stated that he was “not ready” to sign on for another season because of the possibility of a presidential run.[218] Despite this, on March 18, NBC announced they were going ahead with production.[219] On June 29, after widespread negative reaction stemming from Trump’s campaign announcement speech, NBC released a statement saying, “Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump.”[220]\n After Trump’s election campaign and presidential win led to his departure from the program, actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced Trump as host for the fifteenth season.[221] Trump is still credited as an executive producer for the show.[222]\n Professional wrestling\n Trump is a World Wrestling Entertainment fan and a friend of WWE chairman Vince McMahon. In 1988–89 Trump hosted WrestleMania IV and V at Boardwalk Hall (dubbed “Trump Plaza” for storyline purposes) and has been an active participant in several of the shows.[223] He also appeared in WrestleMania VII, and was interviewed ringside at WrestleMania XX.[224]\n Trump appeared at WrestleMania 23 in a match called “The Battle of the Billionaires”.[223] He was in Bobby Lashley’s corner, while Vince McMahon was in the corner of Lashley’s opponent Umaga, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest referee.[223] The terms of the match were that either Trump or McMahon would have their head shaved if their competitor lost.[223] Lashley won the match, and so McMahon was shaved bald.[223]\n On June 15, 2009, McMahon announced as part of a storyline on Monday Night Raw that he had “sold” the show to Trump.[223] Appearing on screen, Trump declared that he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person and would give a full refund to the people who purchased tickets to the arena for that night’s show.[223] McMahon “bought back” Raw the following week for twice the price.[223]\n In 2013, Trump was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame at Madison Square Garden for his contributions to the promotion. He made his sixth WrestleMania appearance the following night at WrestleMania 29.[225]\n As president, Trump appointed WWE CEO Linda McMahon to his Cabinet as Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[226]\n Acting and public image\n Main articles: Filmography of Donald Trump, Donald Trump in popular culture, and Donald Trump in music\n Trump has made cameo appearances in 12 films and 14 television series.[227] He played an oil tycoon in The Little Rascals,[228] and had a singing role at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2006.[229] Trump is a member of the Screen Actors Guild and receives an annual pension of more than $110,000.[230][231] His television reality show The Apprentice was twice (2004 and 2005) nominated for an Emmy Award.[232]\n Trump has been the subject of comedians, flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond and Alec Baldwin, and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode “Bart to the Future”, written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform party, anticipated a future Trump presidency. A dedicated parody series called The President Show debuted in April 2017.[233]\n Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show on talk radio.[234] Trump also had his own daily talk radio program called Trumped!, from 2004 to 2008.[235][236][237] Since the 1980s, Trump’s wealth and lifestyle have been a fixture of hip hop lyrics,[238] his name being quoted by more than 50 artists.[239]\n Political career up to 2015\n Early involvement in politics\n a full-page newspaper advertisement in which Trump placed full-page advertisements critiquing U.S. defense policy\n Trump’s September 1987 advertisement in The Boston Globe, criticizing U.S. defense policy\n Trump first vaguely expressed interest in running for office in 1987, when he spent almost $100,000 to place full-page advertisements in several newspapers. In his view at that time, “America should stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves”,[240] and “should present Western Europe and Japan with a bill for America’s efforts to safeguard the passage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.”[241] According to a Gallup poll in December 1988, Trump was the tenth most admired person in America.[242][243]\n Trump considered running for president in 1988, 2000, 2004, and 2012, and for Governor of New York in 2006 and 2014, but aside from 2000 did not enter any of those races.[244][245] In February 2009, Trump appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and spoke about the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10. He said that “instead of asking for money”, General Motors “should go into bankruptcy and work that stuff out in a deal.”[246]\n Trump publicly speculated about seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, and a Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll released in March 2011 found Trump leading among potential contenders; he was one point ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.[247] A Newsweek poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of incumbent president Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for president of the United States.[248] A poll released in April 2011 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for president while he was still actively considering a run.[249][250] His moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[251][252][253]\n Trump played a leading role in “birther” conspiracy theories that had been circulating since President Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.[254][255] Beginning in March 2011, Trump publicly questioned Obama’s citizenship and eligibility to serve as President.[256][257][258] Although the Obama campaign had released a copy of the short-form birth certificate in 2008,[259] Trump demanded to see the original “long-form” certificate.[256] He mentioned having sent investigators to Hawaii to research the question, but he did not follow up with any findings.[256] He also repeated a debunked allegation that Obama’s grandmother said she had witnessed his birth in Kenya.[260][261] When the White House later released Obama’s long-form birth certificate,[262] Trump took credit for obtaining the document, saying “I hope it checks out.”[263] His official biography mentions his purported role in forcing Obama’s hand,[264] and he has defended his pursuit of the issue when prompted, later saying that his promotion of the conspiracy made him “very popular”.[265] In 2011, Trump had called for Obama to release his student records, questioning whether his grades warranted entry into an Ivy League school.[266] When asked in 2015 whether he believed Obama was born in the United States, Trump said he did not want to discuss the matter further.[267][268] In September 2016, Trump publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S., and said that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign.[257][269][270]\n Donald Trump, dressed in a black suit with white shirt, and blue tie. He is facing toward the viewer and speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2011.\n Trump speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011\n Trump made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011. His appearance at CPAC was organized by GOProud, an LGBT conservative organization, in conjunction with GOProud supporter Roger Stone, who was close with Trump. GOProud pushed for a write-in campaign for Trump at CPAC’s presidential straw poll. The 2011 CPAC speech Trump gave is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[271][272]\n In the 2012 Republican primaries, Trump generally had polled at or below 17 percent among the crowded field of possible candidates.[273] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election, while also saying he would have become the President of the United States, had he run.[251]\n In 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).[274] During the lightly attended early-morning speech, Trump spoke out against illegal immigration, then-President Obama’s “unprecedented media protection”, and advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.[275][276]\n Additionally, Trump spent over $1 million in 2013 to research a possible run for president of the United States.[277] In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. In response to the memo, Trump said that while New York had problems and that its taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him.[278] In January 2014, Trump made statements denying climate change that were discordant with the opinion of the scientific community.[279] A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election.[280] In February 2015, Trump told NBC that he was not prepared to sign on for another season of The Apprentice, as he mulled his political future.[281]\n Political affiliations\n Trump shaking hands with President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Both are standing and facing each other.\n Trump meets with President Ronald Reagan at a 1987 White House reception.\n Trump’s political party affiliation has changed numerous times over the years. Trump was a Democrat prior to 1987.[282] In 1987, Trump registered as a Republican in Manhattan.[283]\n In 1999, Trump switched to the Reform Party and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001 due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.[284]\n From 2001 to 2008, Trump identified himself as a Democrat, but in 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for President. In 2009, he officially changed his party registration to Republican.[285] In December 2011, Trump became an independent for five months before returning to the Republican Party, where he later pledged to stay.[286][287]\n Trump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top ten recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans.[288] After 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats.[289] In February 2012, Trump openly endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for President.[290] When asked in 2015 which of the last four presidents he prefers, Trump picked Democrat Bill Clinton over the Republican Bushes.[291][292]\n According to a New York state report, Trump circumvented corporate and personal campaign donation limits in the 1980s—although no laws were broken—by donating money to candidates from 18 different business subsidiaries, rather than donating primarily in his own name.[293][294] Trump told investigators he did so on the advice of his lawyers. He also said the contributions were not to gain favor with business-friendly candidates, but simply to satisfy requests from friends.[293][295]\n 2000 presidential campaign\n Main article: Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000\n In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in 2000.[284][296] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[297] Trump eventually dropped out of the race due to party infighting, but still went on to win the party’s California and Michigan primaries.[298][299][300]\n 2016 presidential campaign\n Main article: Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016\n Trump speaking behind a brown wooden podium, wearing a dark blue suit and a red tie. The podium sports a blue “TRUMP” sign.\n Trump campaigning in Laconia, New Hampshire, on July 16, 2015\n On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in Manhattan. In the speech, Trump drew attention to domestic issues such as illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large priorities during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again”.[301]\n In his campaign, Trump said that he disdained political correctness; he also stated that the media had intentionally misinterpreted his words, and he made other claims of adverse media bias.[302][303][304] In part due to his fame, Trump received an unprecedented amount of free media coverage during his run for the presidency, which elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.[305]\n Republican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan were hesitant to support him during his early quest for the presidency. They doubted his chances of winning the general election and feared that he could harm the image of the Republican Party.[306][307]\n The alt-right movement coalesced around Trump’s candidacy,[308] due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[309][310] The connection of this group to the Trump campaign is controversial; writers such as Jon Ronson have suggested that the link between Trump and right-wing figures such as Alex Jones and Roger Stone is a marriage of convenience.[311] Trump personally condemned the alt-right in an interview after the election.[312]\n During the campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white nationalists,[313] especially in his initial refusal to condemn the support of David Duke—a former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan—in a CNN interview with Jake Tapper. He had previously criticized Duke in 1991, disavowed the 2000 Reform Party due to the support of Duke and others, and disavowed Duke on the campaign trail both before and after the interview.[314] In August, he appointed Steve Bannon—the executive chairman of Breitbart News—as his campaign CEO; the website was described by Bannon as “the platform for the alt-right.”[315] However, Bannon later told the Wall Street Journal that he was an “economic nationalist” but not “a supporter of ethno-nationalism.”[316] According to Michael Barkun, the Trump campaign was remarkable for bringing fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[317]\n Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on Trump supporters and vice-versa both inside and outside the venues.[318][319][320]\n Campaign rhetoric\n Fact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates.[321][322][323] At least four major publications – Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times – have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements.[324] NPR said that Trump’s campaign statements were often opaque or suggestive.[325] Lucas Graves, an assistant professor of journalism and mass communication at the University of Wisconsin–Madison,[326] opined that Trump “often speaks in a suggestive way that makes it unclear what exactly he meant, so that fact-checkers “have to be really careful” when picking claims to check, “to pick things that reflect what the speaker was clearly trying to communicate.”[327]\n Trump’s penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth and where puffery abounds.[328] Trump has called his public speaking style “truthful hyperbole”, an effective political tactic that may, however, backfire for overpromising.[328] Martin Medhurst, a Baylor University professor of communication and political science, analyzed Trump’s frequently used rhetorical devices, such as catchy slogans, hyperbole, insinuations and preterition.[329]\n Financial disclosures\n Further information: Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016 § Refusal to release tax returns\n In compliance with FEC regulations of all presidential candidates, Trump published a 92-page financial disclosure form in 2015; the form listed all of his assets, liabilities, income sources and hundreds of business positions.[76] His decision not to release his tax returns[330] was contrary to usual practice by every presidential candidate since Gerald Ford in 1976.[331] Although there is no law that requires presidential candidates to release their returns,[332] Trump’s refusal led to speculation that he was hiding something.[333] Trump explained that his tax returns were being audited and his lawyers had advised him against releasing the returns.[334][335] However, no law prohibits release of tax returns during an audit.[336] Tax attorneys differ about whether such a release is wise legal strategy.[337] Trump has told the news media that his tax rate was “none of your business”, but added, “I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.”[338][339][340]\n On October 1, 2016, three pages of Trump’s 1995 tax return were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times, who said she received the documents in her Times mailbox. Each of the three pages is one page from Trump’s state filings in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. They show that using allowed deductions for losses, Trump claimed a loss of $916 million that year. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.[341] When asked if he used the tax code to avoid paying taxes, he said, “Of course I did. Of course I did.” He then went on to say he paid “hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes”, calling it a “simple” thing. “I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too”, he said.[342][343][344]\n On March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump’s 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, who unveiled them on her show. The two pages showed that Trump paid $38 million in federal taxes and had a gross adjusted income of $150 million.[345][346] The White House confirmed the authenticity of the 2005 documents and stated: “Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.”[345][346]\n Republican primaries\n Main article: Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016\n Trump rally in the U.S. Bank Arena, Cincinnati, Ohio, on October 13, 2016\n Trump entered a field of 17 major candidates who were vying for the 2016 Republican nomination; this was the largest presidential field in American history.[347] Trump participated in eleven of the twelve Republican debates, skipping only the January 28th seventh debate, which was the last debate before primary voting began on the first of February. The debates received historically high television ratings, which increased the visibility of Trump’s campaign.[348]\n By early 2016, the race had mostly centered on Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.[349] On Super Tuesday, Trump won the plurality of the vote, and he remained the front-runner throughout the remainder of the primaries. By March 2016, Trump became poised to win the Republican nomination.[350] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016—which prompted the remaining candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns—RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[351] With nearly 14 million votes, Trump broke the all-time record in the history of the Republican Party for winning the most primary votes. He also set the record for the largest number of votes cast against the front runner.[352]\n General election campaign\n Further information: United States presidential election, 2016\n Trump–Pence 2016 campaign logo\n After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump shifted his focus to the general election. He urged remaining primary voters to “save [their] vote for the general election.”[353] Trump began campaigning against Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016, and continued to campaign across the country.\n Clinton had established a significant lead over Trump in national polls throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton’s lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI’s re-opening of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy.[354][355][356]\n Donald Trump and his running mate for vice president, Mike Pence, at the Republican National Convention in July 2016. They appear to be standing in front of a huge screen with the colors of the American flag displayed on it. Trump is at left, facing toward the viewer and making “thumbs-up” gestures with both hands. Pence is at right, facing toward Trump and clapping.\n Trump gives the thumbs up as his running mate Mike Pence approves at the Republican National Convention, July 20, 2016\n On July 15, 2016, Trump announced his selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate.[357] Four days later on July 19, Trump and Pence were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the Republican National Convention.[358] The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole, but the other prior nominees did not attend.[359][360]\n Two days later, Trump officially accepted the nomination in a 76-minute speech that was inspired by Richard Nixon’s 1968 acceptance speech.[361] The historically long speech was watched by nearly 35 million people and received mixed reviews, with net negative viewer reactions according to CNN and Gallup polls.[362][363][364]\n On September 26, 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced off in their first presidential debate, which was held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. NBC News anchor Lester Holt was the moderator.[365] The TV broadcast was the most watched presidential debate in United States history.[366] The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning narrative of that debate was dominated by a leaked tape of Trump making lewd comments, and counter-accusations by Trump of sexual misconduct done by Bill Clinton. Trump had invited four women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to a press conference prior to the debate. The final presidential debate was held on October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Trump’s refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular press attention.[367][368]\n Political positions\n Main article: Political positions of Donald Trump\n Trump’s campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.–Mexico border. His other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. During the campaign, he also advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS or IS).\n Media have described Trump’s political positions as “populist”,[369][370] and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation,[371] consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment,[372] usually considered a liberal (Democratic Party) policy.[373][374] According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a “fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views”, but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[375][376]\n Trump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time.[377][378][379] Politico has described his positions as “eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory”,[379] while NBC News counted “141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues” during his campaign.[380]\n Russian interference in election\n Main article: Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections\n In January 2017, American intelligence agencies – the CIA, FBI and NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence – jointly stated with “high confidence” that the Russian government attempted to intervene in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[381][382] In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, former FBI Director James Comey affirmed he has “no doubt” that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, adding “they did it with purpose and sophistication”.[383][384]\n Trump claims that the investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election is the pursuit of a false narrative, calling it “the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!”[385] Russian president Vladimir Putin echoed Trump’s opinion, saying that Democrats cling to this fictitious explanation to avoid confronting their election loss.[386]\n Interactions with Russia\n Main article: Links between Trump associates and Russian officials\n Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump at the 2017 G-20 Hamburg Summit\n There has been intensive media scrutiny of Trump’s relationship to Russia.[387][388] During the campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a strong leader.[389][390] One of his campaign managers, Paul Manafort, had worked for several years to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovich win the Ukrainian presidency.[391] Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, have been connected to Russian officials.[392][393] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[394]\n Members of Trump’s campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[395] In a December 29, 2016 conversation, Flynn and Kislyak discussed the recently imposed sanctions against Russia; Trump later fired Flynn for falsely claiming he had not discussed the sanctions.[396]\n In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that “the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.”[397]\n In 2017, Trump and other senior White House officials asked the Director of National Intelligence, the NSA director, the FBI director, and two chairs of congressional committees to publicly dispute the news reports about contacts between Trump associates and Russia.[398]\n Sexual misconduct allegations\n Main articles: Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording and Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations\n Two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women.[399][400][401] The hot mic recording was captured on a studio bus in which Trump and Billy Bush were preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. “I just start kissing them,” Trump said, “I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything … grab them by the pussy.”[402] During the recording, Trump also spoke of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he “moved on her very heavily.”[402] These statements were recorded several months after Trump married his third and current wife, Melania, who was pregnant at the time.[402][403]\n Trump’s language on the tape was described by the media as “vulgar”, “sexist”, and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident prompted him to make his first public apology during the campaign,[404][405] and caused outrage across the political spectrum,[406][407] with many Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of his candidacy and some urging him to quit the race.[408] Subsequently, at least 15 women[409] came forward with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping, resulting in widespread media coverage.[410][411]\n Trump and his campaign have denied all of the sexual misconduct accusations, which Trump has called “false smears”, and alleged a conspiracy against him.[412][413][414] In his two public statements in response to the controversy, Trump responded by alleging that Bill Clinton, former President of the United States and husband of Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, had “abused women” and that Hillary had bullied her husband’s victims.[415]\n Election to the presidency\n Main article: United States presidential election, 2016\n 2016 electoral vote results\n On Election Day, November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 electoral votes to Clinton’s 232 votes. The counts were later adjusted to 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides, formalizing Trump’s election to the presidency.[416] In the early hours of November 9, Clinton called Trump to concede the election. Trump then delivered his victory speech before hundreds of supporters in the New York Hilton hotel. The speech was in contrast with some of his previous rhetoric, with Trump promising to heal the division caused by the election, thanking Clinton for her service to the country, and promising to be a president to all Americans.[417][418]\n Trump received a smaller share of the popular vote than Clinton, making him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[419][nb 1] Clinton finished ahead by 2.86 million votes or 2.1 percentage points, 48.04% to 46.09%, with neither candidate reaching a majority nationwide.[422][423]\n Trump’s victory was considered a stunning political upset, as polls consistently showed Hillary Clinton leading nationwide (which were consistent with her win in the popular vote) and in most battleground states, while Trump’s support had been underestimated throughout his campaign.[424] The errors in some state polls were later partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton’s support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump’s support among white working-class voters.[425] Trump won the perennial swing states of Florida, Iowa and Ohio, and flipped Clinton’s “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which had been Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Trump’s victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control of both chambers of Congress, as was the case during parts of George W. Bush’s presidency from 2003 to 2007.\n Trump is the wealthiest president in U.S. history.[426] He is also the first president without prior governmental or military experience.[427][428][429] Of the 43[nb 2] previous presidents, 38 had held prior elective office; two had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet; and three had never held public office but had been commanding generals.[429]\n Protests\n Main article: Protests against Donald Trump\n Trump’s election victory sparked protests across the United States. His opponents took to the streets to amplify their opposition to Trump’s views and denounce his inflammatory statements. Trump initially said on Twitter that the protests consisted of “professional protesters, incited by the media”, and were “unfair”, but he later stated that he loves their passion for the country.[431][432] After Obama’s re-election in 2012, Trump had tweeted “We can’t let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!”[433]\n On the Saturday following Trump’s inauguration, massive demonstrations took place in the United States and worldwide in protest of Trump; approximately 2,600,000 people took part in Women’s Marches worldwide.[434] One of these marches was the Women’s March on Washington (in Washington, D.C.), where over 500,000 people marched in opposition to Trump.[435]\n Electoral history\n Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016\n Party Candidate Votes %\n Republican Donald Trump 14,015,993 votes\n 1,441 delegates\n (41 contests) Votes: 44.9%\n Delegates: 58.3%\n Republican Ted Cruz 7,822,100 votes\n 551 delegates\n (11 contests) Votes: 25.1%\n Delegates: 22.3%\n Republican Marco Rubio 3,515,576 votes\n 173 delegates\n (3 contests) Votes: 11.3%\n Delegates: 7%\n Republican John Kasich 4,290,448 votes\n 161 delegates\n (1 contest) Votes: 13.8%\n Delegates: 6.5%\n United States presidential election, 2016\n Party Candidate Votes %\n Republican Donald Trump 62,979,879 votes\n 304 electors\n (30 states + ME-02) Votes: 46.0%\n Electors: 56.5%\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 65,844,954 votes\n 227 electors\n (20 states + DC) Votes: 48.1%\n Electors: 42.2%\n Presidency\n Main article: Presidency of Donald Trump\n For a chronological guide to this subject, see Timeline of the presidency of Donald Trump.\n Transition\n Main article: Presidential transition of Donald Trump\n President Obama and President-elect Trump meet in the Oval Office on November 10, 2016, two days after the election.\n On November 10, Trump had his first ever meeting with outgoing President Barack Obama to discuss plans for an orderly transition of power. The New York Times said, “It was an extraordinary show of cordiality and respect between two men who have been political enemies and are stylistic opposites.”[436] The BBC stated that “their antipathy was barely concealed” in “awkward photos” of the meeting.[437]\n White House appointments\n For a more comprehensive list, see Political appointments of Donald Trump.\n New Jersey Governor Chris Christie led Trump’s transition team until November 11, 2016, when Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over.[438] Since then, Trump has chosen RNC chairman Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff[439] and businessman and media executive Steve Bannon as White House Chief Strategist.[440]\n Cabinet-level nominations\n Main articles: Cabinet of Donald Trump and Formation of Donald Trump’s Cabinet\n Trump’s cabinet nominations included Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General,[441] financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury,[442] retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense,[443] and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.[444] Trump also brought on board politicians who had opposed him during the presidential campaign, notably neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[445] and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations.[446]\n While most of Trump’s nominees were approved by the GOP majority in the Senate, the confirmation of education reform activist Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education[447] required Vice President Pence to cast a rare tie-breaking vote.[448]\n Most cabinet members were unable to take office on Inauguration Day because of delays in the formal confirmation process. Part of the lateness was ascribed to delays in submitting background-check paperwork, and part to obstructionism by Senate Democrats.[449] The last Cabinet member, Robert Lighthizer, took office as U.S. Trade Representative on May 11, 2017, more than four months after his nomination.[450]\n Pre-inauguration events\n On November 22, Trump outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office in a video posted on YouTube. The plan included the United States’ withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and asking the U.S. Department of Defense to develop a plan to protect the U.S. from cyber-attack.[451][452]\n On December 7, Time named Trump as its “Person of the Year”.[453] In an interview on The Today Show, he said he was honored by the award, but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the “President of the Divided States of America.”[454][455] He also opposed Time’s decision to change its “Man of the Year” title to “Person of the Year” in 1999, describing the action as too “politically correct”.[456] On December 13 he was named Financial Times Person of the Year.[457] In December 2016, Forbes ranked Trump the second most powerful person in the world, after Vladimir Putin and before Angela Merkel.[458]\n Based on intelligence reports issued from October 2016 to January 2017, the Obama administration accused the Russian government of trying to influence the U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump, by supplying the DNC emails to WikiLeaks for publication.[459] Trump,[460] WikiLeaks[461] and Russian officials[462] have denied the allegations.\n Early actions\n Main article: First 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency\n Chief Justice John Roberts administers the oath of office to Donald Trump as his family looks on.\n Trump’s inauguration as the 45th President was held on Friday, January 20, 2017. In his first week as president, Trump signed six executive orders. His first order as president set out interim procedures in anticipation of repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). That same week, Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, re-instated the Mexico City Policy, reopened the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects and signed an executive order to begin planning, designing and constructing a new Mexico border wall and reinforce border security.[463]\n On January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[464] The Senate confirmed the nomination on April 7 with a 54–45 vote.[465]\n Travel ban\n Main articles: Executive Order 13769, Executive Order 13780, and Legal challenges to Executive Orders 13769 and 13780\n Trump signing Executive Order 13769 at the Pentagon as the Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Defense James Mattis look on, January 27, 2017\n On January 27, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns about terrorism. The order was imposed without warning and took effect immediately.[466] Confusion and protests caused chaos at many airports,[467] as travelers were detained on arriving in the United States or barred from boarding U.S.-bound planes.[468] The administration then clarified that visitors with a green card were exempt from the ban.[469][470]\n On January 30, Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General, directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the executive order and was promptly dismissed.[471] She was replaced as acting Attorney General by Dana Boente, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who agreed to enforce the order.[472] Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and on February 5 a federal judge in Seattle blocked its implementation.[473][474] On October 24, 2017, the Supreme Court dismissed the only remaining travel ban appeal as being moot because the revised order had expired. It expressed “no views on the merits” of the case.[475]\n On March 6, Trump issued a revised order, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, removed priorities for religious minorities (e.g. Christian refugees), and allowed for a week to implement legislation.[476][466] Again federal judges in Hawaii, Maryland and Virginia blocked its implementation.[477] On June 26, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the lower courts and allowed most provisions of the revised executive order to take effect. The Supreme Court ruled that Trump’s ban can be enforced on visitors from targeted countries who lack a “credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.”[478] The court scheduled full hearings in October.[478]\n On September 24, 2017 the temporary executive order, which was close to expiry, was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea, Chad, and Venezuela (only on certain government officials and their families).[479] These provisions were slated to take effect on October 18,[479] and the Supreme Court cancelled the hearing that was planned for October 10.[480] On October 17, a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the portions of these provisions applying to the six Muslim-majority countries, leaving only the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela to take effect.[481]\n Dismissal of James Comey\n Main article: Dismissal of James Comey\n On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey. He attributed the action to recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein,[482] which criticized Comey’s conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton’s emails.[483] On May 11, Trump stated that he was concerned with the ongoing “Russia thing”[484] and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[485]\n According to a Comey memo of a private conversation on February 14, 2017, Trump said he “hoped” Comey would drop the investigation into Michael Flynn,[486] who had been forced to resign as National Security Advisor after it was discovered that he had misled the Vice President about communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\n In March and April, Trump had told Comey that the ongoing suspicions formed a “cloud” impairing his presidency,[487] and asked him to publicly state that he was not personally under investigation.[488] He also asked DNI Dan Coats and NSA Director Michael Rogers to issue statements saying there was no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.[489] Both refused, considering this an inappropriate request, although not illegal.[490] Comey eventually testified on June 8 that while he was director, the FBI investigations did not target Trump himself.[487][491] The Washington Post later reported that within days of Comey’s dismissal, the FBI started investigating whether Trump had obstructed justice.[492] Trump’s lawyer Jay Sekulow stated that he had not been notified of any such investigation.[493] ABC News later reported that the special counsel is gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice but has not launched a full-scale investigation.[494]\n Trump attracted attention for implying that he had “tapes” of conversations with Comey, before later stating that he did not in fact have such tapes.[495]\n False and misleading statements\n As president, Trump has frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks.[496][497][498] Trump uttered “at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days” in office[496] and 492 total in his first 100 days in office.[497] “Fact Checker”, a political analysis column in The Washington Post, wrote: “President Trump is the most fact-challenged politician that The Fact Checker has ever encountered… the pace and volume of the president’s misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up.”[497]\n Domestic policy\n Energy\n Trump’s energy policy advocates domestic industrial support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter.[499] His appointed advisers favor a less regulated energy market and, because they do not consider climate change a threat, see no need for immediate action.[500]\n Climate change\n Main article: Environmental policy under the Trump administration\n Trump does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.[501][502] In 2012, he said that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese, but later said that he was joking.[503][504] He has called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a “disgrace” and has threatened to cut its budget.[505] Trump pledged to eliminate the Clean Power Plan[506] and withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which calls for reductions in carbon emissions in more than 170 countries.[507] After winning the presidency, Trump said he had an “open mind” towards the Paris agreement,[508] but on June 1, 2017, he announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, making the United States one of only three nations at the time, besides Syria and Nicaragua, not to be members.[509]\n Immigration\n Main article: Immigration policy of Donald Trump\n Trump conferring with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly, January 25, 2017\n Trump’s immigration policies were intensely discussed during the campaign. Trump vowed to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico–United States border to keep out illegal immigrants, a wall that Trump promised Mexico would pay for.[510][511][512] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[513] and criticized birthright citizenship as it creates “anchor babies”.[514] He said the focus of deportation would be criminals, those who have overstayed their visas, and other “security threats”.[515]\n Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to completely ban Muslim non-citizens from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[516][517][518] Later in 2016 he stated that the ban would apply only to people originating from countries with a “proven history of terrorism against the United States or its allies”, or countries “compromised by terrorism”.[519][520][521]\n Shortly after coming into office, Trump issued a limited travel ban, which was suspended by federal courts and eventually came into effect following a June 2017 Supreme Court decision.[478]\n Social issues\n Main article: Social policy of Donald Trump\n Trump is conservative, describes himself as pro-life, and generally opposes abortion; exceptions are made in cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[522] He has said that he is committed to appointing justices who would try to overturn the ruling in Roe v. Wade.[523] He personally supports “traditional marriage”[503] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a “settled” issue.[523]\n Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[524][525] although his views have shifted over time.[526] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[527] He favors capital punishment,[528][529] as well as the use of waterboarding.[530][531]\n Health care\n In 1999, Trump told Larry King Live that “I believe in universal healthcare.”[532] Trump’s 2000 book, The America We Deserve, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model,[533] and has voiced admiration for the Scottish National Health Service.[532][534][535]\n As a candidate Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare.[536][537] Starting early in his presidency he urged Congress to repeal and replace it. In May the United States House of Representatives voted to repeal the ACA.[538] However, the Senate tried for several months but was unable to pass any of several versions of a repeal bill.[539] Trump has expressed a desire to “let Obamacare fail”, and the Trump administration has cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[540][541][542]\n Trump aims to streamline the Department of Veterans Affairs, getting rid of backlogs and waitlists, and upgrading relevant facilities.[543] On his first Monday in office, Trump issued a federal hiring freeze on the VA.[544]\n Education\n Trump has stated his support for school choice and local control for primary and secondary schools.[545] He opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative for primary and secondary schools,[546] and has called it “a disaster” that must be ended.[547] He has stated he would abolish all or part of the Department of Education.[548]\n Economy and trade\n Main article: Economic policy of Donald Trump\n Trump speaking to auto workers in Michigan in March 2017\n Trump’s campaign tax plan called for levelling the corporate tax rate to 15%, eliminating various business loopholes and deductions,[371] and reducing the number of brackets for personal income tax: the top rate would be reduced from 39.6% to 25%, a large “zero bracket” would be created, and the alternative minimum tax and estate tax (which currently applies to individual estates over $5.45 million or $10.9 million per married couple) would both be eliminated.[549] His comments about the minimum wage have been inconsistent.[550][551][552]\n Trump identifies as a “free trader”, but says that trade must be “reasonably fair”.[553] He has often been called a “protectionist”,[554][555][556] because of his criticism of NAFTA,[557][558] the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),[559] and his proposal to significantly raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States.[560][561] He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted.[562][563] However, Trump has been very keen to support a “fair” post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom,[564] which Trump says would be “good for both sides”.[565]\n Government size and deregulation\n Trump’s early policies have favored deregulation and a smaller federal government. He became the first president in sixteen years to sign a Congressional Review Act disapproval resolution; the law had been used only once before.[566] During his first six weeks in office, he abolished ninety federal regulations.[567][568]\n On January 23, 2017, Trump ordered a temporary government-wide hiring freeze, which allows for exceptions, primarily for jobs deemed vital for national security or public safety reasons.[569][570] The Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office told a House committee that hiring freezes have not proven to be effective in reducing costs.[571] Unlike some past freezes, the current freeze bars agencies from adding contractors to make up for employees leaving.[571]\n A week later Trump signed Executive Order 13771, directing administrative agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation they issue.[572][573] Harvard Law professor Jody Freeman said that the order would do no more than slow the regulatory process, because it did not block rules required by statute.[574]\n On February 24, 2017, Trump ordered the agencies to create task forces to determine which regulations are deemed burdensome to the U.S. economy.[575] Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump’s criticisms, saying that the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups.[576]\n Foreign policy\n Main articles: Foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration and Foreign policy of Donald Trump\n President Trump together with other leaders at the 43rd G7 summit in Italy, May 2017\n Trump has been described as non-interventionist[577][578] and nationalist.[579] He repeatedly stated that he supports “America First” foreign policy.[580] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[579] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[581] He says America should look inward, stop “nation building”, and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[578] As a candidate he questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[582] and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[583] But as president he has reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to NATO.[584]\n In order to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Trump in 2015 called for seizing the oil in ISIS-occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops.[585] In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region,[586][587] a position he later retracted.[588] Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is “a big fan of Israel”.[589] During the campaign he said he would relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from its current location, Tel Aviv, although he has not pursued that proposal as president.[590] On May 22, 2017, Trump was the first U.S. president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem, during his first foreign trip, visiting Israel, Italy, the Vatican, and Belgium.[591]\n Both as a candidate and as president, Trump repeatedly said he wants a good relationship with Russia.[592][593] Trump has pledged to hold a summit meeting with Vladimir Putin.[594] He added that Russia could help the U.S. in fighting ISIS militants.[595] On April 7, 2017, Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian airfield in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[596]\n North Korea became a major issue in mid-2017. During the campaign and the early months of his presidency, Trump had hoped that China would help to rein in North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and missile tests.[597] However, North Korea accelerated its missile testing, leading to an increase in tensions in April 2017.[597] In July, the country tested two long-range missiles identified by Western observers as intercontinental ballistic missiles, potentially capable of reaching Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland.[598][599] In August, Trump dramatically escalated his rhetoric against North Korea, warning that further provocation against the U.S. will be met with “fire and fury like the world has never seen.”[600] North Korean leader Kim Jong-un then threatened to direct the country’s next missile test toward Guam. Trump responded that if North Korea took steps to attack Guam, “[t]hings [would] happen to them like they never thought possible.”[601]\n Impeachment efforts\n Main article: Efforts to impeach Donald Trump\n On July 12, 2017, California Representative Brad Sherman formally introduced an article of impeachment, H. Res. 438,[602] accusing the president of obstructing justice regarding the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.[603]\n 2020 presidential campaign\n Main article: Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2020\n Trump signaled his intention to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within hours of assuming the presidency.[604][605] This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one.[606] Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office.[607] By February 1, 2017, the campaign had already raised over $7 million.[608]\n Awards, honors, and distinctions\n Honorary degrees\n Honorary Doctor of Laws from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (1988)[609][610]\n Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Wagner College in Staten Island, New York (2004)[611][612]\n Honorary Doctor of Business Administration from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland (2010)[613][614] (revoked in 2015)[615]\n Honorary Doctor of Business Administration from Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia (2012)[616][617]\n Honorary Doctor of Laws from Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia (2017)[618][619]\n Organizational recognitions\n A ceremony in which Trump receiving the 2015 Marine Corps–Law Enforcement Foundation’s annual Commandant’s Leadership Award.

Despite their similarities, some of these five elections had peculiar results; e.g. John Quincy Adams trailed in both the national popular vote and the electoral college in 1824 (since no-one had a majority in the electoral college, Adams was chosen by the House of Representatives), and Samuel Tilden in 1876 remains the only losing candidate to win an actual majority of the popular vote (rather than just a plurality).[420][421]\n ^ Grover Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th president.p\n – Aryan Yadav \n CEO and Founder The Aryan Yadav Foundation \n Special thanks to Diva Gandhi.

Raised largely in Hawaii, Obama also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\n During his first two years in office, Obama signed many landmark bills. Main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as “Obamacare”, shortened as the “Affordable Care Act”, or abbreviated as the ACA), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession, but the GOP regained control of the House of Representatives in 2011. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.\n After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating. He currently resides in Washington, D.C. His presidential library will be built in Chicago.\n Contents\n Early life and career\n Main article: Early life and career of Barack Obama\n Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[3] at Kapiʻolani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii.[4][5][6] He is the first President to have been born in Hawaii,[7] making him the first President born outside of the contiguous 48 states.[8] He was born to a white mother and a black father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, of mostly English descent,[9] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.[10] His father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982), was a married Luo Kenyan man from Nyang’oma Kogelo. Obama’s parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on scholarship.[11][12] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[13][14]\n In late August 1961, Obama’s mother moved with him to the University of Washington in Seattle for a year. During that time, Obama Sr. completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii in June 1962, then left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama’s parents divorced in March 1964.[15] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time. He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas time in 1971,[16] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[17] Of his early childhood, Obama recalled, “That my father looked nothing like the people around me – that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk – barely registered in my mind.”[12] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[18]\n In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography at the University of Hawaii, and the couple were married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[19] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966, followed sixteen months later by his wife and stepson in 1967, with the family initially living in a Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet subdistrict of south Jakarta, then from 1970 in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng subdistrict of central Jakarta.[20]\n Education\n From age six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (Besuki Public School) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[21][22] During his time in Indonesia, Obama’s step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him “a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works”.[23]\n Obama returned to Honolulu in 1971 to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School— a private college preparatory school— with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until his graduation from high school in 1979.[24] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname “Barry”.[25] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[26] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[27] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian cancer and uterine cancer.[28]\n Reflecting later on his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: “The opportunity that Hawaii offered – to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect – became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.”[29] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to “push questions of who I was out of my mind”.[30] Obama was also a member of the “choom gang”, a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.[31][32]\n After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation’s policy of apartheid.[33] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks.[33] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[34] and in English literature[35] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[36] He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,[37][38] then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.[39][40][41]\n Family and personal life\n Main article: Family of Barack Obama\n Obama posing in the Green Room of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia in 2009\n In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: “It’s like a little mini-United Nations”, he said. “I’ve got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I’ve got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.”[42] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng, the daughter of his mother and her Indonesian second husband) and seven half-siblings from his Kenyan father’s family—six of them living.[43] Obama’s mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,[44] until her death on November 2, 2008,[45] two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[46] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother’s family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.[47]\n  \n Obama with Jonathan Toews and the Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks in 2010\n Besides his native English, Obama speaks some basic Indonesian, having learned the language during his four childhood years in Jakarta.[48][49] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school’s varsity team;[50] he is left-handed.[51]\n Obama about to take a shot while three other players look at him. One of those players attempts to block Obama.\n Obama taking a left-handed jump shot during a pick-up game on the White House basketball court, 2009\n Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.[52] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.[53] He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as President.[54] In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[55]\n Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.[56] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.[56][57] The relationship was only made public in May 2017, several months after Obama’s two-term presidency had ended.[57]\n  \n Obama and his wife Michelle at the Civil Rights Summit at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2014\n In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin.[58] Assigned for three months as Obama’s adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at several group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date.[59] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[60] The couple’s first daughter, Malia Ann, was born on July 4, 1998,[61] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (“Sasha”), on June 10, 2001.[62] The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School.[63] The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[64] In August 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[65]\n Applying the proceeds of a book deal, the family moved in 2005 from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago.[66] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko’s subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[67]\n In December 2007, Money estimated the Obama family’s net worth at $1.3 million.[68] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.[69][70] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans’ families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[71][72] As per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.[73]\n In reference to Obama’s smoking habit, Michelle said in early 2010 that he had quit smoking.[74][75]\n On his 55th birthday, August 4, 2016, Obama penned an essay in Glamour describing how his daughters and being president have made him a feminist.[76][77][78]\n Religious views\n The Obamas worship at African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., January 2013\n Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[79] He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he “was not raised in a religious household”. He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet “in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known.” He described his father as a “confirmed atheist” by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as “a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.” Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand “the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.”[80]\n In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: “I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.”[81] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying “I’m a Christian by choice. My family didn’t – frankly, they weren’t folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn’t raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – being my brothers’ and sisters’ keeper, treating others as they would treat me.”[82][83]\n Obama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright in October 1987, and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[84] He resigned from Trinity in May 2008 during his first presidential campaign after some of Wright’s statements were criticized.[85] The Obama family has attended several Protestant churches since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John’s Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but are not habitual church-goers.[86][87][88]\n Law career\n Community organizer and Harvard Law School\n Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama was hired in Chicago as director of the Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago’s South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[40][89] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants’ rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.[90] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.[91] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.[92][93]\n External video\n Derrick Bell threatens to leave Harvard, April 24, 1990, 11:34, Boston TV Digital Archive[94] Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25\n Obama entered Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts.[95] He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,[96] president of the journal in his second year,[90][97] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.[98] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as an associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins &amp; Sutter in 1990.[99] After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude[100] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.[96] Obama’s election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention[90][97] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[101] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[101]\n Chicago Law School and civil rights attorney\n In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.[101][102] He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[103]\n From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois’s Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain’s Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of “40 under Forty” powers to be.[104]\n He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.).[105] This class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.[106] The case was settled out of court.[107] Final Judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.[108] His law license became inactive in 2007.[109][110]\n From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago, which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project, and of the Joyce Foundation.[40] He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[40]\n Legislative career\n Illinois State Senator (1997–2004)\n Main article: Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama\n State Senator Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after ShoreBank co-founder Milton Davis in 1998\n Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois’s 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park–Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn.[111] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.[112] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.[113] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan’s payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.[114]\n He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.[115] In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois’s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.[116]\n In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate’s Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[117] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.[113][118] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.[119] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.[120]\n 2004 U.S. Senate campaign\n Main article: United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004\n County results of the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois.

He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.[121]\n Obama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration’s 2003 invasion of Iraq.[122] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War,[123] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally,[124] and spoke out against the war.[125] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd that “it’s not too late” to stop the war.[126]\n Decisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates.[127] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.[128] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention,[129] seen by 9.1 million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.[130]\n Obama’s expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.[131] Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.[132] In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70% of the vote.[133]\n U.S. Senator from Illinois (2005–08)\n Main article: United States Senate career of Barack Obama\n The official portrait of Obama as a member of the United States Senate\n Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,[134] becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus.[135] CQ Weekly characterized him as a “loyal Democrat” based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007. Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.[136]\n Legislation\n See also: List of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate\n Obama cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.[137] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;[138] and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.[139] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators Tom Carper, Tom Coburn, and John McCain—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.[140]\n Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee.[141] Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.[142]\n Gray-haired man and Obama stand, wearing casual polo shirts.

The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.[161] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[162]\n Photograph\n President George W. Bush meets with President-elect Obama in the Oval Office on November 10, 2008\n On August 23, Obama announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.[163] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine.[164] At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.[165] Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide.[166][167][168]\n During both the primary process and the general election, Obama’s campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.[169] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.[170]\n  \n 2008 electoral vote results\n John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected Sarah Palin as his running mate.

Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice.[186][187] President Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago’s McCormick Place after his reelection and said: “Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.”[188][189]\n Presidency (2009–2017)\n Main article: Presidency of Barack Obama\n See also: Confirmations of Barack Obama’s Cabinet and List of international presidential trips made by Barack Obama\n First 100 days\n Main article: First 100 days of Barack Obama’s presidency\n Photograph\n Barack Obama takes the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John G.

He promised that the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and would be 80% reliant on “clean” electricity.[207][208]\n LGBT rights\n On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim’s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[209]\n On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV, which was celebrated by Immigration Equality.[210]\n On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign[211][212] to end the Don’t ask, don’t tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces.[213] In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that also barred transgender people from serving openly in the military.[214]\n As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said that he favored legalizing same-sex marriage.[215] By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said that he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners, but he opposed same-sex marriages for strategic reasons.[216] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[217][218]\n During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013,[189] Obama became the first president to call for full equality for gay Americans: “Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law – for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.” This was the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word “gay” in an inaugural address.[219][220]\n  \n The White House was illuminated in rainbow colors on the evening of the Supreme Court same-sex marriage ruling, June 26, 2015.\n In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage)[221] and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).[222] Then, following the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (ruling same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right), Obama asserted that, “This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free.”[223]\n On July 30, 2015 the White House Office of National AIDS Policy revised its strategy for addressing the ailment, which included widespread testing and linkage to healthcare, which was celebrated by the Human Rights Campaign.[224]\n White House advisory and oversight groups\n On March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which forms part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.[225] The Council is currently chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett.[226] Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through an official United States government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.[226][227][228] The current co-chairs of the Task Force are Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett.[227] The Task Force has been a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that, the 1994 Violence Against Women Act that was first drafted by Biden.[229]\n Economic policy\n Main article: Economic policy of the Barack Obama administration\n File:20090124 WeeklyAddress.ogvPlay media\n Obama presents his first weekly address as President of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\n On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.[230] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.[231]\n In March, Obama’s Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.[232] Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry[233] in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms’ bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat[234] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.[235] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[236] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as “Cash for Clunkers”, that temporarily boosted the economy.[237][238][239]\n  \n Deficit and debt increases, 2001–16\n Spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department authorized by the Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion was spent by the end of November 2009.[240] Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5 trillion or 10.6% of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion or 9.9% of GDP.[241][242] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will shrink to $1.34 trillion, and the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53 trillion or 90% of GDP.[243] The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2 trillion took effect in February 2014.[244] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation’s debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.[245] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[246]\n  \n US employment statistics (unemployment rate and monthly changes in net employment) during Obama’s tenure as U.S. President[247][248]\n As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[249] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[250] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,[251] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.[252] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.[253] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.[254] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[254] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was “unusually uncertain”.[255] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.[256]\n The Congressional Budget Office and a broad range of economists credit Obama’s stimulus plan for economic growth.[257][258] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million,[258][259][260][261] while conceding that “It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.”[257] Although an April 2010 survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[262] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II.[263] The OECD credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus in the United States and the austerity measures in the European Union.[264]\n Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes.[265] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[266]\n In December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a “defining challenge of our time” and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis’ criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics.[267]\n Obama has urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[268]\n Environmental policy\n See also: Climate change policy of the United States\n Obama at a 2010 briefing on the BP oil spill at the Coast Guard Station Venice in Venice, Louisiana\n On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb global warming.[269][270]\n On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[271] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[272]\n In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and stated he “would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution” or “greenhouse emissions”.[273][274] Obama’s advisers called for a halt to petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.[275] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would authorize the pipeline.[276] It was the third veto of Obama’s presidency and his first major veto.[277]\n Obama has emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.[278]\n Health care reform\n Main article: Health care reform in the United States\n Photograph\n Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010\n Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[279] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.[280][281]\n  \n Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and federal poverty level, under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 (Source: CRS)[282]\n On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[279] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[283] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[284]\n On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[285][286] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.[287] On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.[288] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.[289]\n The ACA includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,[290] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400% of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum “out-of-pocket” payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,[291][292] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and Congressional Budget Office figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.[291][293]\n  \n Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (Source: JAMA)[294]\n The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[295] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[296] In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.[297]\n The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress’s taxing authority.[298] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that “closely-held” for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans “established by the State”, as the statute reads.[299]\n Energy policy\n Main article: Energy policy of the Obama administration\n Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based “All of the above” approach to domestic energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.[300] Obama’s approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation’s available energy resources.[301][302]\n Gun control\n Main article: Social policy of the Barack Obama administration § Gun policy\n Obama visiting 2012 Aurora shooting victims at University of Colorado Hospital\n On January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control.[303] He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.[304] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.[305] In a 2016 editorial in the New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed “common-sense gun reform” to women’s suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history.[306]\n 2010 midterm elections\n Main articles: United States House of Representatives elections, 2010 and United States Senate elections, 2010\n Obama called the November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,[307] “humbling” and a “shellacking”.[308] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.[309]\n Cybersecurity and Internet policy\n On November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the Federal Communications Commission reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[310][311] On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed Executive Order 13636, “Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity”.[312]\n Foreign policy\n Main article: Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration\n President Obama stands at a podium delivering a speech on “A New Beginning” at Cairo University on June 4, 2009\n Obama speaking on “A New Beginning” at Cairo University on June 4, 2009\n International trips made by President Barack Obama during his terms in office\n Obama visiting the Rijksmuseum with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, 2014\n In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a “new era” in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms “break” and “reset” to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[313] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab cable TV network, Al Arabiya.[314]\n On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year’s video message to the people and government of Iran.[315][316] In April, Obama gave a speech in Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.[317] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for “A New Beginning” in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[318]\n On June 26, 2009, Obama responded to the Iranian government’s actions towards protesters following Iran’s 2009 presidential election by saying: “The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.”[319] While in Moscow on July 7, he responded Vice President Biden’s comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: “We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.”[320]\n On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. President to preside over a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.[321]\n In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.[322][323] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about one-third.[324] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[325]\n In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[326] He criticized Russia’s law discriminating against gays in August 2013,[327] stopping short of advocating a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, Russia.[328]\n  \n Obama meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi at the White House, October 2016\n In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to normalize relationships between Cuba and the United States.[329] The countries’ respective “interests sections” in one another’s capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015.\n In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a “Joint Planning Cell” with Saudi Arabia.[330]\n Before leaving office, Obama said German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been his “closest international partner” throughout his tenure as President.[331]\n War in Iraq\n Main articles: Iraq War and American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)\n On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, “Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.”[332] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop’s levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.[333][334] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.[335] On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be “home for the holidays”.[336]\n US President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron trade bottles of beer to settle a bet they made on the U.S. vs. England World Cup Soccer game (which ended in a tie), during a bilateral meeting at the G20 Summit in Toronto, Canada, Saturday, June 26, 2010\n Meeting with UK Prime Minister David Cameron during the 2010 G20 Toronto summit\n In June 2014, following the capture of Mosul by ISIS, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.[337][338]\n In August 2014, during the Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS.[339]\n By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict[340] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.[341]\n In the spring of 2015, with the addition of the “Panther Brigade” of the 82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq surged to 4,400,[342] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.[343]\n War in Afghanistan\n Main article: War in Afghanistan (2001–14)\n Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.[344] He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to “stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan”, an area he said had not received the “strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires”.[345] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal’s Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.[346] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;[347] this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal’s staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.[348] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.[349]\n In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.[350]\n Israel\n President Barack Obama, at left, shakes hands with Israeli President Shimon Peres, at right, in the Oval Office on Tuesday, May 5, 2009. Standing at right looking on is U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.\n Obama meeting with Israeli President Shimon Peres in the Oval Office, May 2009\n In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.[351] Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.[352]\n In June 2011, Obama said that the bond between the United States and Israel is “unbreakable”.[353] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.[354] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.[355]\n In 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama’s view, “with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.”[356]\n In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said that both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, “To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I’ve been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.”[357] Obama expressed support for Israel’s right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[358]\n On December 23, 2016 under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, effectively allowing it to pass.[359] Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticized the Administration’s actions,[360][361] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million in United States dollars, on January 6, 2017.[362] On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.[363][364]\n Libya\n Main article: 2011 military intervention in Libya\n President Obama meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss Syria and ISIS, September 29, 2015\n In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution[365] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[366] In response to the unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to “show no mercy” to the rebels of Benghazi[367]—announced an immediate cessation of military activities,[368] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling Misrata. The next day, on Obama’s orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government’s air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[369] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[370][371][372] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all of its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[373] Some Representatives[374] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[375][376]\n Syrian Civil War\n See also: Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War § United States\n On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: “The time has come for President Assad to step aside.”[377][378] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.[379] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.[380] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.[381][382]\n In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the “red line” he had pledged[383] and, rather than authorise the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued.[384][385] In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL, but repeatedly promised that the U.S. would not deploy ground troops in Syria.[386][387]\n Death of Osama bin Laden\n Main article: Death of Osama bin Laden\n File:President Obama on Death of Osama bin Laden.ogvPlay media\n President Obama’s address (9:28)\n Also available: Audio only; Full text Wikisource has information on “Remarks by the President on Osama bin Laden”\n President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on Operation Neptune’s Spear, a mission against Osama bin Laden, in one of the conference rooms of the Situation Room of the White House, on May 1, 2011.

See also: Situation Room\n Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad.[388] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[388] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a “surgical raid” to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[388] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[389][390] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden’s corpse,[391] which was buried at sea several hours later.[392] Within minutes of the President’s announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City’s Ground Zero and Times Square.[389][393] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush,[394] and from many countries around the world.[395]\n Iran nuclear talks\n Obama talks with Benjamin Netanyahu, March 2013\n Main article: Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\n In November 2013, Obama’s administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action”, saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[396][397][398]\n Relations with Cuba\n Main article: United States–Cuban Thaw\n President Obama meeting with Cuban President Raúl Castro in Panama, April 2015\n Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City.[399] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.[400] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.[401]\n In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente.[402] Popularly dubbed the Cuban Thaw, The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be “Obama’s finest foreign policy achievement.”[403] On July 1, 2015, President Barack Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and Havana.[404] The countries’ respective “interests sections” in one another’s capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.[405]\n Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to arrive since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.[406]\n Africa\n Obama spoke in front of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progresses made in education, infrastructure, and economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans.[407][408] During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.[409]\n Hiroshima speech\n On May 27, 2016, 21⁄2 months before the 71st anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima that ended World War II, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit Hiroshima, Japan. Accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Obama paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.[410]\n Russia\n Obama meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in September 2015.\n See also: Russia–United States relations § Obama’s tenure (2009–2017)\n After Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 presidential election[411] in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Obama’s Russia policy was widely seen as a failure.[412] George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said that Obama had “allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West”, adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.[413]\n Cultural and political image\n Main article: Public image of Barack Obama\n See also: International reaction to the United States presidential election, 2008 and International reactions to the United States presidential election, 2012\n First official presidential portrait of Barack Obama, wearing a black suit with a blue tie and American flag lapel pin, indoors with the American flag and the flag of the President draped in the background\n Obama’s first term presidential portrait (2009)\n Obama’s family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement.[414] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is “black enough”, Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that “we’re still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.”[415] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: “I wouldn’t be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.”[416]\n Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.[417] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.[418] Former presidential campaign surrogate and Georgetown professor, Michael Eric Dyson, is both critical and sympathetic of President Obama’s leadership in race relations, indicating that Obama’s speeches and action on racial disparity and justice have been somewhat reactive and reluctant when, especially in the later part of his second term, racial violence demanded immediate presidential action and conversation.[419]\n  \n Presidential Approval Ratings\n According to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating[420] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010,[421] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan’s and Bill Clinton’s first years in office.[422] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.[423][424] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration.[425] Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.[426]\n Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.[427][428] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.[429] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.[430][431]\n Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom, President Barack Obama, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, President François Hollande of France and others react emotionally while watching the overtime shootout of the Chelsea vs. Bayern Munich Champions League final, in the Laurel Cabin conference room during the G8 Summit at Camp David, Maryland, May 19, 2012.

Bush started during his presidency in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen. Obama also ordered drone strikes in Libya in 2011, the Philippines in 2012, and Syria in 2014.[481] Obama left about 9,800 US troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 US troops in Iraq, 503 US troops in Syria, 133 US troops in Pakistan, 106 US troops in Somalia, 7 US troops in Yemen, and 2 US troops in Libya at the end of his presidency.[482][483]\n According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2015, that inmates sentenced in US federal custody declined by 5% under US President Obama.

The film also featured Bill Nye, Alex Trebek, Michael Richards, and Jamie Lee Curtis. The show revolved around DeGeneres’ falling asleep and finding herself in an energy-themed version of Jeopardy!, playing against an old rival, portrayed by Curtis, and Albert Einstein. The next film had DeGeneres co-hosting an educational look at energy with Nye.

Rosenthal.\n At the Governor’s Ball after the 46th Annual Emmy Awards telecast, September 1994\n DeGeneres’s comedy career became the basis of the successful sitcom Ellen, named These Friends of Mine during its first season. The ABC show was popular in its first few seasons due in part to DeGeneres’s style of observational humor; it was often referred to as a “female Seinfeld.”[13]\n Ellen reached its height of popularity in April 1997, when DeGeneres came out as a lesbian on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Her character on the sitcom also came out of the closet to her therapist, played by Oprah Winfrey.[14] The coming-out episode, titled “The Puppy Episode”, was one of the highest-rated episodes of the show. The series returned for a fifth season but experienced falling ratings due to ABC’s cutting back on promoting the show.[citation needed] It was believed that The Walt Disney Company, ABC’s parent owner, had become uncomfortable with the subject matter depicted on the show now that DeGeneres’ character was openly gay.[citation needed] In May 1998, Ellen was canceled.

Following George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton to the podium, she came out in a bathrobe and furry slippers. “They told me everyone would be wearing robes,” she said. Ellen then went on to make another commencement speech at Tulane in 2009.[15]\n The show broadcast for a week from Universal Studios Orlando in March 2007. Skits included DeGeneres going on the Hulk Roller Coaster Ride and the Jaws Boat Ride. In May 2007, DeGeneres was placed on bed rest due to a torn ligament in her back. She continued hosting her show from a hospital bed, tended to by a nurse, explaining “the show must go on, as they say.” Guests sat in hospital beds as well. On May 1, 2009, DeGeneres celebrated her 1000th episode, featuring celebrity guests such as Oprah Winfrey, Justin Timberlake, and Paris Hilton, among others.[citation needed]\n DeGeneres attending Oprah Winfrey’s 50th birthday party in Los Angeles, California, in January 2004\n On September 9, 2009, it was confirmed that DeGeneres would replace Paula Abdul as a judge of the ninth season of American Idol. Her role started after the contestant auditions, at the beginning of “Hollywood Week”.[16][17] It is reported that DeGeneres also signed a contract to be a judge on the show for at least five seasons.[18] She made her American Idol debut on February 9, 2010. However, on July 29, 2010, DeGeneres and Fox executives announced that the comedian would be leaving American Idol after one season. In a statement, DeGeneres said that the series “didn’t feel like the right fit for me”.[19]\n Award shows\n DeGeneres received wide exposure on November 4, 2001, when she hosted the televised broadcast of the Emmy Awards. Presented after two cancellations due to network concerns that a lavish ceremony following the September 11 attacks would appear insensitive, the show required a more somber tone that would also allow viewers to temporarily forget the tragedy. DeGeneres received several standing ovations for her performance that evening, which included the line: “What would bug the Taliban more than seeing a gay woman in a suit surrounded by Jews?”\n In August 2005, DeGeneres hosted the 2005 Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony held on September 18, 2005. This was three weeks after Hurricane Katrina, making it the second time she hosted the Emmys following a national tragedy. She also hosted the Grammy Awards in 1996 and in 1997.\n On September 7, 2006, DeGeneres was selected to host the 79th Academy Awards ceremony, which took place on February 25, 2007.[20] This makes her the first openly gay or lesbian person to have hosted the event. During the Awards show, DeGeneres said, “What a wonderful night, such diversity in the room, in a year when there’s been so many negative things said about people’s race, religion, and sexual orientation. And I want to put this out there: If there weren’t blacks, Jews and gays, there would be no Oscars, or anyone named Oscar, when you think about that.”[21] Reviews of her hosting gig were positive, with one saying, “DeGeneres rocked, as she never forgot that she wasn’t just there to entertain the Oscar nominees but also to tickle the audience at home.”[22] Regis Philbin said in an interview that “the only complaint was there’s not enough Ellen.”\n DeGeneres was nominated for an Emmy Award as host of the Academy Awards broadcast.[23] On August 2, 2013, it was announced that DeGeneres would host the Academy Awards on March 2, 2014, for the second time.[24]\n A selfie orchestrated by 86th Academy Awards host Ellen DeGeneres during the broadcast is the second-most retweeted tweet ever.[25][26] DeGeneres said she wanted to homage Meryl Streep’s record 17 Oscar nominations by setting a new record with her, and invited other Oscar celebrities to join them. The resulting photo of twelve celebrities broke the previous retweet record within forty minutes and was retweeted over 1.8 million times in the first hour.[27][28][29] By the end of the ceremony it had been retweeted over 2 million times, less than 24 hours later, it had been retweeted over 2.8 million times.[26][27] As of May 2017, it has been retweeted over 3.4 million times.[26] The group selfie effort was parodied by Lego and Matt Groening with The Simpsons.[30][31] It beat the previous record, which was held by Barack Obama, following his victory in the 2012 presidential election.[29][32][33]\n Other ventures\n At Tulane University in 2009\n Voice acting\n DeGeneres lent her voice to the role of Dory, a friendly fish with short-term memory loss, in the 2003 animated Disney/Pixar film Finding Nemo.[34] The film’s director, Andrew Stanton, said that he chose Ellen because she changed the subject five times before one sentence had finished on her show.[35] For her performance as Dory, DeGeneres won the Saturn Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films for Best Supporting Actress; Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie from the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards; and the Annie Award from the International Animated Film Association, for Outstanding Voice Acting. She was also nominated for a Chicago Film Critics Association Award in the Best Supporting Actress category. She also provided the voice of the dog in the prologue of the Eddie Murphy feature film Dr. Dolittle. Her win of the Saturn Award marked the first and only time the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films has given the acting award for a voice performance.\n She reprised the role of Dory from Finding Nemo in the 2016 sequel, Finding Dory.\n Commercial spokesperson\n In November 2004, DeGeneres appeared, dancing, in an ad campaign for American Express. Her most recent American Express commercial, a two-minute black-and-white spot in which she works with animals, debuted in November 2006 and was created by Ogilvy &amp; Mather. In 2007, the commercial won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial.\n DeGeneres began working with CoverGirl Cosmetics in September 2008, for which she has been criticized, as her animal-friendly values clash with Procter and Gamble’s (the maker of CoverGirl Cosmetics) animal testing.[36] Her face became the focus of CoverGirl advertisements starting in January 2009. The beauty campaign was DeGeneres’s first.[37]\n On December 3, 2011, DeGeneres headlined the third annual “Change Begins Within” gala for the David Lynch Foundation held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.[38][39]\n In spring 2012, DeGeneres became the spokesperson for J. C. Penney in a tour and advertising campaign.[10]\n DeGeneres represents a line of products on QVC, a home shopping network. Her line of home products, initialized as E.D., for Ellen DeGeneres, began being offered on QVC on October 24, 2014, under the name E.D. on Air.[40]\n Eleveneleven\n Main article: eleveneleven\n On May 26, 2010, DeGeneres announced on her show that she was starting her own record label entitled “eleveneleven”. She explained her choice of name, claiming that she often sees the number 11:11 when looking at her clocks, that she found Greyson on the 11th, and that the singer’s soccer jersey has the number 11.[41] She mentioned that she had been looking for videos of performances on YouTube to start her label. The first act she signed to the label is Greyson Chance.[42]\n Ed by Ellen\n Ellen launched her lifestyle brand Ed by Ellen in the summer of 2015.[43] It includes clothes, shoes, accessories, baby and home items. The PetSmart dog line was launched in February 2017[44] and a cat line was introduced later that year.[45]\n Personal life\n Forbes estimated DeGeneres’ 2017 earnings at US$77 million.[46] In 2015, she was named the 50th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes[47] and number two on the World Pride Power list.[48] By July 30, DeGeneres has more than 71 million followers on Twitter and 47 million on Instagram, making her the sixth most followed user on Twitter and the 28th most followed user on Instagram.\n She is a fan of the National Football League and has shown particular support for the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers.[49] In 2011, she attended a Saints practice dressed as Packers Hall of Famer Don Hutson.[50]\n Sexual orientation and relationships\n In 1997, DeGeneres came out as lesbian. The disclosure of her sexual orientation sparked intense interest by American tabloids.[51] The contentiousness of the media coverage stunted DeGeneres’ professional career and left her “mired in depression”.[51] In her book Love, Ellen, DeGeneres’ mother, Betty DeGeneres describes being initially shocked when her daughter came out, but she has since become one of her strongest supporters; she is also an active member of Parents &amp; Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) and spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign’s Coming Out Project.\n The same year she came out, DeGeneres started a romantic relationship with actress Anne Heche that lasted until August 2000.[52] From 2000 to 2004, DeGeneres maintained a close affair with actress/director/photographer Alexandra Hedison.[53] The couple appeared on the cover of The Advocate after their separation had already been announced to the media.[54]\n Portia de Rossi and DeGeneres in September 2012\n Since 2004, DeGeneres has had a relationship with Portia de Rossi.[55] After the overturn of the same-sex marriage ban in California, DeGeneres and de Rossi were engaged, and married in August 2008, at their home in Beverly Hills, California, where they live with their four dogs and three cats.[56][57] The passage of Proposition 8 cast doubt on the legal status of their marriage, but a subsequent California Supreme Court judgment validated it because it occurred before November 4, 2008.[58][59][60] On August 6, 2010, de Rossi filed a petition to legally change her name to Portia Lee James DeGeneres.[61] The petition was granted on September 23, 2010.[62]\n Animal rights and being a vegan\n DeGeneres is a vegan. She previously described herself as a vegan and “big animal lover”.[63][64] De Rossi, too, is a vegan.[64]Ellen co-ordinates a vegan outreach website titled ‘Going Vegan with Ellen’.[65] She intended to open a vegan tapas bar, Bokado, in Los Angeles, but plans fell through.[66]\n The site for The Ellen DeGeneres Show contains a section called “Going Vegan With Ellen”, in which she promotes “Meatless Mondays” and features vegan recipes.[67] She has several times invited Humane Society of the United States CEO Wayne Pacelle to speak on her show about the organization’s efforts in animal protection legislation. In 2009, PETA named her their “Woman of the Year.”[68] In April 2013, she donated $25,000 to stop Ag-Gag anti-whistleblower legislation in Tennessee, which would prohibit undercover investigators from recording footage of animal abuse on farms.[69]\n DeGeneres served as campaign ambassador to Farm Sanctuary’s Adopt-A-Turkey Project in 2010, asking people to start “a new tradition by adopting a turkey instead of eating one” at Thanksgiving.[70]\n Humanitarianism\n In November 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton named her a Special envoy for Global AIDS Awareness.[71] On December 3, 2011, DeGeneres opened the show at the David Lynch Foundation’s 3rd annual “Change Begins Within” gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to raise funds to bring Transcendental Meditation to at-risk populations suffering from epidemic levels of chronic stress and stress-related disorders. She says: “TM is the only time I have that stillness... it gives me this peaceful feeling, and I love it so much. I can’t say enough good things about it. All the benefits that you can achieve from sitting still and going within—it really is a beautiful experience. David Lynch is such a wonderful man to start this foundation to help people.”[72][73]\n Filmography\n Film\n Year Title Role Notes\n 1990 Arduous Moon[74] Herself Short film\n 1991 Wisecracks[75] Herself Documentary\n 1993 Coneheads Coach\n 1994 Trevor Herself Short film\n 1996 Mr. Wrong Martha Alston\n 1998 Goodbye Lover Sgt.

Jobs was the chairman, and the chief executive officer (CEO), and a co-founder of Apple Inc.; CEO and majority shareholder of Pixar;[2] a member of The Walt Disney Company’s board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak are widely recognized as pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.\n Steve Jobs\n Steve Jobs Headshot 2010-CROP.jpg\n Jobs showing off the iPhone 4 at the 2010 Worldwide Developers Conference\n Born Steven Paul Jobs\n February 24, 1955\n San Francisco, California, U.S.\n Died October 5, 2011 (aged 56)\n Palo Alto, California, U.S.\n Cause of death Pancreatic cancer\n Resting place Alta Mesa Memorial Park\n Education Homestead High School\n Occupation\n Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc.\n Primary investor and CEO of Pixar\n Founder and CEO of NeXT\n Known for Pioneer of the personal computer revolution with Steve Wozniak\n Board member of\n The Walt Disney Company[1]\n Apple Inc.\n Spouse(s) Laurene Powell\n (m. 1991)\n Partner(s) Chrisann Brennan\n Children 4, including Lisa\n Relatives Mona Simpson (sister)\n He was born in San Francisco to parents who had to put him up for adoption at birth; he was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1960s. [3] Jobs then attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out [4], and decided to travel through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism.[5] Jobs’s declassified FBI report stated that an acquaintance knew that Jobs had used marijuana (the formerly illegalized drug in California), and LSD while he was in college.[6] Jobs once told a reporter that taking LSD was “one of the two or three most important things” he did in his life.[7]\n Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak’s Apple I personal computer. The visionaries gained fame and wealth a year later for the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. In 1979, after a tour of PARC, Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984. In addition to being the first mass-produced computer with a GUI, the Macintosh introduced the sudden rise of the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Following a long power struggle, Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985.[8]\n After leaving Apple, Jobs took a few of its members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in state-of-the-art computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, Jobs helped to initiate the development of the visual effects industry when he funded the spinout of the computer graphics division of George Lucas’s Lucasfilm in 1986.[9] The new company, Pixar, would eventually produce the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story—an event made possible in part because of Jobs’s financial support.\n In 1997, Apple merged with NeXT. Within a few months of the merger, Jobs became CEO of his former company; he revived Apple at the verge of bankruptcy. Beginning in 1997 with the “Think different” advertising campaign, Jobs worked closely with designer Jonathan Ive to develop a line of products that would have larger cultural ramifications: the iMac, iTunes and iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new Mac OS X, based on NeXT’s NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time.\n Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003 and died on October 5, 2011, of respiratory arrest related to the pancreatic tumor.\n Contents\n Background\n Parents\n Steve Jobs’s biological parents were Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble. His adoptive parents were Paul Jobs and Clara Hagopian.\n His biological father, Abdulfattah “John” Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي) (b. March 15, 1931), grew up in Homs, Syria and was born into an Arab Muslim household.[10] Jandali is the son of a self-made millionaire who did not go to college and a mother who was a traditional housewife.[10] While an undergraduate at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, he was a student activist and spent time in jail for his political activities.[10] Although Jandali initially wanted to study law, he eventually decided to study economics and political science.[10] He pursued a PhD in the latter subject at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Carole Schieble (b. August 1, 1932), a Catholic of Swiss and German descent, who grew up on a farm in Wisconsin.[11][10][12] As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a teaching assistant for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age.[13] Jobs’s full biological sister (Mona Simpson), notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating Jandali: “it wasn’t that he was Middle-Eastern so much as that he was a Muslim. But there are a lot of Arabs in Michigan and Wisconsin. So it’s not that unusual.”[13] Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs’s official biographer, additionally states that Schieble’s father “threatened to cut Joanne off completely” if she continued the relationship.[11]\n Jobs’s adoptive father, Paul Reinhold Jobs (1922–1993), grew up in a Calvinist household,[14] the son of an “alcoholic and sometimes abusive” father.[11] The family lived on a farm in Germantown, Wisconsin.[11][14] Paul bore an ostensible resemblance to James Dean; he had tattoos, dropped out of high school, and traveled around the Midwest for several years during the 1930s looking for work.[11][14] He eventually joined the United States Coast Guard as an engine-room machinist.[14] After World War II, Paul Jobs decided to leave the Coast Guard when his ship docked in San Francisco.[14] He made a bet that he would find his wife in San Francisco and promptly went on a blind date with Clara Hagopian (1924–1986). They were engaged ten days later and married in 1946.[11] Clara, the daughter of Armenian immigrants, grew up in San Francisco and had been married before, but her husband had been killed in the war. After a series of moves, Paul and Clara settled in San Francisco’s Sunset District in 1952.[11] As a hobby, Paul Jobs rebuilt cars, but his career was as a “repo man”, which suited his “aggressive, tough personality.”[14] Meanwhile, their attempts to start a family were halted after Clara had an ectopic pregnancy, leading them to consider adoption in 1955.[11]\n Birth\n “Of all the inventions of humans, the computer is going to rank near or at the top as history unfolds and we look back. It is the most awesome tool that we have ever invented. I feel incredibly lucky to be at exactly the right place in Silicon Valley, at exactly the right time, historically, where this invention has taken form.”\n —Steve Jobs, 1995. From the documentary, Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview.[15]\n Job’s biological mother Schieble became pregnant with him in 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer with his family in Homs, Syria. Jandali has stated that he “was very much in love with Joanne … but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria. And so she told me she wanted to give the baby up for adoption.”[16] Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble’s father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry.[11] In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954.[14] According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: “without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me … she did not want to bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone.”[16] Schieble put herself in the care of a “doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions.”[11]\n Schieble gave birth to Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco and chose an adoptive couple for him that was “Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy.”[17] The couple changed their mind, however, and decided to adopt a girl instead.[17] The baby boy was then placed with the Bay Area blue collar couple Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and Schieble refused to sign the adoption papers.[11] She then took the matter to court in an attempt to have her baby placed with a different family[17] and only consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after they promised that he would attend college.[11] When Steve Jobs was in high school, his mother Clara admitted to his girlfriend, 17-year-old Chrisann Brennan, that she “was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first six months of his life … I was scared they were going to take him away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I wanted to return him.”[17] When Chrisann shared his mother’s comment with Steve, he stated that he was already aware of that[17] and would later say he was deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara.[18] Many years later, Steve Jobs’s wife Laurene also noted that “he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents.”[18] Jobs would become upset when Paul and Clara were referred to as “adoptive parents” as they “were my parents 1,000%.”[11] With regard to his biological parents, Jobs referred to them as “my sperm and egg bank. That’s not harsh, it’s just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more.”[11] Jandali has also stated that “I really am not his dad. Mr. and Mrs. Jobs are, as they raised him. And I don’t want to take their place.”[16]\n Childhood\n “I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics ... then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that’s what I wanted to do.”\n —Steve Jobs[11]\n Paul and Clara adopted Jobs’s sister Patricia in 1957[11] and the family moved to Mountain View, California in 1961.[14] It was during this time that Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to “pass along his love of mechanics.”[11] Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father’s craftsmanship “because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him … I wasn’t that into fixing cars … but I was eager to hang out with my dad.”[11] By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood.[14] He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a “loner.”[14]\n Home of Paul and Clara Jobs, on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.\n Childhood home of Steve Jobs in Los Altos, California that served as the original site of Apple Computer. The home was added to a list of historic Los Altos sites in 2013.[19]\n Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved and was suspended a few times.[14] Clara had taught him to read as a toddler, and Jobs stated that he was “pretty bored in school and [had] turned into a little terror… you should have seen us in the third grade, we basically destroyed the teacher.”[14] He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary school in Mountain View.[11] His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not placing enough challenge on his brilliant son.[11]\n Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene ‘Teddy’ Hill, with turning him around: “She taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation. She bribed me into learning. She would say, ‘I really want you to finish this workbook. I’ll give you five bucks if you finish it.’ That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn’t let it happen.”[14] Jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View[14] where he became a “socially awkward loner.”[11] Jobs “was often bullied” and gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.\n Though the Jobs family was not well off, they used all their savings in 1967 to buy a new home, which would allow Jobs to change schools.[14] The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California) was in the better Cupertino School District, Cupertino, California, [11] and was embedded in an environment that was even more heavily populated with engineering families than the Mountain View home.[14] The house was declared a historic site in 2013 as it was the first site for Apple Computer[19] and is now owned by Patty and occupied by Jobs’s step-mother Marilyn.[20]\n When he was 13 in 1968, Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project: “He didn’t know me at all, but he ended up giving me some parts and he got me a job that summer working at Hewlett-Packard on the line, assembling frequency counters…well, assembling may be too strong. I was putting in screws. It didn’t matter; I was in heaven.”[14]\n Bill Fernandez, a fellow electronics hobbyist who was in Jobs’s grade at Cupertino Junior High, was his first friend after the 1967 move. Fernandez later commented that “for some reason the kids in the eighth grade didn’t like [Jobs] because they thought he was odd. I was one of his few friends.” Fernandez eventually introduced Jobs to 18-year-old electronics whiz and Homestead High alumn Steve Wozniak, who lived across the street from Fernandez.\n Homestead High\n The location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to attend Homestead High School in (and with strong ties to) Silicon Valley.[11] He began his first year there in late 1968 along with Fernandez.[14] Neither Jobs nor Fernandez (whose father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in John McCollum’s “Electronics 1.”[14] McCollum and the rebellious Jobs (who had grown his hair long and become involved in the growing counterculture) would eventually clash and Jobs began to lose interest in the class. He also had no interest in sports and would later say that he didn’t have what it took to “be a jock. I was always a loner.”[14]\n He underwent a change during mid-1970: “I got stoned for the first time; I discovered Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas, and all that classic stuff. I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative writing classes.”[14] Jobs also later noted to his official biographer that “I started to listen to music a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology—Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear … when I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP English class. The teacher was this guy who looked like Ernest Hemingway. He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite.” From that point, Jobs developed two different circles of friends: those who were involved in electronics and engineering and those who were interested in art and literature.[11] These dual interests were particularly reflected during Jobs’s senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan.[17]\n In 1971 after Wozniak began attending University of California, Berkeley, Jobs would visit him there a few times a week. This experience led him to study in nearby Stanford University’s student union. Jobs also decided that rather than join the electronics club, he would put on light shows with a friend for Homestead’s avant-garde Jazz program. He was described by a Homestead classmate as “kind of a brain and kind of a hippie … but he never fit into either group. He was smart enough to be a nerd, but wasn’t nerdy. And he was too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. He was kind of an outsider. In high school everything revolved around what group you were in. and if you weren’t in a carefully defined group, you weren’t anybody. He was an individual, in a world where individuality was suspect.” By his senior year in late 1971, he was taking freshman English class at Stanford and working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann.[14] In mid-1972, after graduation and before leaving for Reed College, Jobs and Brennan rented a house from their other roommate, Al.[17][21] During the summer, Brennan, Jobs, and Steve Wozniak found an advertisement posted on the De Anza College bulletin board for a job that required people to dress up as characters from Alice in Wonderland. Brennan portrayed Alice while Wozniak, Jobs, and Al portrayed the White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter.[17]\n Reed College\n “I was interested in Eastern mysticism which hit the shores about then. At Reed there was a constant flow of people stopping by – from Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, to Gary Snyder. There was a constant flow of intellectual questioning about the truth of life. That was the time when every college student in the country read Be Here Now and Diet for a Small Planet.”\n —Steve Jobs[14]\n Later in the year, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Reed was an expensive college which Paul and Clara could ill afford. They were spending much of their life savings on their son’s higher education.[11] Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he was at Reed College. She also met his Reed friend Daniel Kottke for the first time.[17] Jobs also became friends with Reed’s student body president Robert Friedland.[14]\n Brennan (who was now a senior at Homestead) did not have plans to attend college, and was supportive of Jobs when he told her he planned to drop out of Reed because he did not want to spend his parents’ money on it (neither her father nor Jobs’s adoptive parents had gone to college). He continued to attend by auditing classes, including a course on calligraphy taught by Robert Palladino, but since he was no longer an official student, Brennan stopped visiting him. Jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she refused. He had started seeing other women, and she was interested in someone she met in her art class. Brennan speculates that the house was Jobs’s attempt to make their relationship monogamous again.[17] In a 2005 commencement speech for Stanford University, Jobs states that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends’ dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In that same speech, Jobs said: “If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.”[22]\n 1972–1985\n I was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and idealistic industry. There weren’t many degrees offered in computer science, so people in computers were brilliant people from mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever. They loved it, and no one was really in it for the money […] There are people around here who start companies just to make money, but the great companies, well, that’s not what they’re about.”\n —Steve Jobs[23]\n Pre-Apple\n In mid-1972, Jobs moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area and was renting his own apartment. Brennan states by this point that their “relationship was complicated. I couldn’t break the connection and I couldn’t commit. Steve couldn’t either.” Jobs hitchhiked and worked around the West Coast and Brennan would occasionally join him. At the same time, Brennan notes, “little by little, Steve and I separated. But we were never able to fully let go. We never talked about breaking up or going our separate ways and we didn’t have that conversation where one person says it’s over.” They continued to grow apart, but Jobs would still seek her out, and visit her while she was working in a health food store or as a live-in babysitter. They remained involved with each other while continuing to see other people.[17]\n In 1973, Steve Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game Pong. After finishing it, Wozniak gave the board to Jobs, who then took the game down to Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California. Atari thought that Jobs had built it and gave him a job as a technician.[24][25] Atari’s cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described him as “difficult but valuable”, pointing out that “he was very often the smartest guy in the room, and he would let people know that.”[26]\n By early 1973, Jobs was living what Brennan describes as a “simple life” in a Los Gatos cabin, working at Atari, and saving money for his impending trip to India. Brennan visited him twice at the cabin. She states in her memoir that her memories of this cabin consist of Jobs reading Be Here Now (and giving her a copy), listening to South Indian music, and using a Japanese meditation pillow. Brennan felt that he was more distant and negative toward her. Brennan states in her memoir that she met with Jobs right before he left for India and that he tried to give her a $100 bill that he had earned at Atari. She initially refused to accept it but eventually accepted the money.[27]\n Jobs traveled to India in mid-1974[28] to visit Neem Karoli Baba[29] at his Kainchi ashram with his Reed friend (and eventual Apple employee) Daniel Kottke, in search of spiritual enlightenment. When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram, it was almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973.[25] Then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Haidakhan Babaji. In India, they spent a lot of time on bus rides from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.[25]\n After staying for seven months, Jobs left India[30] and returned to the US ahead of Daniel Kottke.[25] Jobs had changed his appearance; his head was shaved and he wore traditional Indian clothing.[31][32] During this time, Jobs experimented with psychedelics, later calling his LSD experiences “one of the two or three most important things [he had] done in [his] life.”[33][34] He spent a period at the All One Farm, a commune in Oregon and Brennan joined him there for a period.[17]\n During this time period, Jobs and Brennan both became practitioners of Zen Buddhism through the Zen master Kōbun Chino Otogawa. Jobs was living with his parents again, in their backyard toolshed which he had converted into a bedroom with a sleeping bag, mat, books, a candle, and a meditation pillow.[17] Jobs engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the oldest Sōtō Zen monastery in the US.[35] He considered taking up monastic residence at Eihei-ji in Japan, and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen.[36] Jobs would later say that people around him who did not share his countercultural roots could not fully relate to his thinking.[33]\n Jobs then returned to Atari and was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout. According to Bushnell, Atari offered US$100 for each TTL chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little specialized knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Much to the amazement of Atari engineers, Wozniak reduced the TTL count to 46, a design so tight that it was impossible to reproduce on an assembly line.[37] According to Wozniak, Jobs told him that Atari gave them only $700 (instead of the $5,000 paid out), and that Wozniak’s share was thus $350.[38] Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later, but said that if Jobs had told him about it and explained that he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.[39]\n Wozniak had designed a low-cost digital “blue box” to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls. Jobs decided that they could make money selling it. The clandestine sales of the illegal “blue boxes” went well and perhaps planted the seed in Jobs’s mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable.[40] Jobs, in a 1994 interview, recalled that it took six months for him and Wozniak to figure out how to build the blue boxes.[41] Jobs said that if not for the blue boxes, there would have been no Apple. He states it showed them that they could take on large companies and beat them.[42][43]\n Apple (1976–1985)\n See also: History of Apple\n “Basically Steve Wozniak and I invented the Apple because we wanted a personal computer. Not only couldn’t we afford the computers that were on the market, those computers were impractical for us to use. We needed a Volkswagen. The Volkswagen isn’t as fast or comfortable as other ways of traveling, but the VW owners can go where they want, when they want and with whom they want. The VW owners have personal control of their car.”\n —Steve Jobs.[14]\n Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975.[44] In 1976, Wozniak invented the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it. Jobs, Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne formed Apple Computer in the garage of Jobs’s Los Altos home on Crist Drive.[45] Wayne stayed only a short time, leaving Jobs and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company.[46] A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Jobs as an odd individual who would greet his clients “with his underwear hanging out, barefoot and hippie-like.”[20] Another neighbor, Larry Waterland, who had just earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford, recalled dismissing Jobs’s budding business: ” ‘You punched cards, put them in a big deck,’ he said about the mainframe machines of that time. ‘Steve took me over to the garage. He had a circuit board with a chip on it, a DuMont TV set, a Panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard. He said, ‘This is an Apple computer.’ I said, ‘You’ve got to be joking.’ I dismissed the whole idea.’ “[20] Jobs’s friend from Reed College and India, Daniel Kottke, recalled that he “was the only person who worked in the garage … Woz would show up once a week with his latest code. Steve Jobs didn’t get his hands dirty in that sense.” Kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in Jobs’s kitchen, where he spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the company.[20]\n They received funding from a then-semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer Mike Markkula.[47] Scott McNealy, one of the cofounders of Sun Microsystems, said that Jobs broke a “glass age ceiling” in Silicon Valley because he’d created a very successful company at a young age.[43]\n “For what characterizes Apple is that its scientific staff always acted and performed like artists – in a field filled with dry personalities limited by the rational and binary worlds they inhabit, Apple’s engineering teams had passion. They always believed that what they were doing was important and, most of all, fun. Working at Apple was never just a job; it was also a crusade, a mission, to bring better computer power to people. At its roots that attitude came from Steve Jobs. It was “Power to the People”, the slogan of the sixties, rewritten in technology for the eighties and called Macintosh.”\n —Jeffrey S. Young, Steve Jobs: The Journey is the Reward (1987).[14]\n After she returned from her own journey to India, Brennan visited Jobs at his parents’ home, where he was still living. It was during this period that Jobs and Brennan fell in love again, as Brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to Kobun (whom she was also still following). It was also at this time that Jobs displayed a prototype Apple computer for Brennan and his parents in their living room. Brennan notes a shift in this time period, where the two main influences on Jobs were Apple and Kobun. By the early 1977, she and Jobs would spend time together at her home at Duveneck Ranch in Los Altos, which served as a hostel and environmental education center. Brennan also worked there as a teacher for inner city children who came to learn about the farm.[17]\n In 1977, Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire. It was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer and was one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products,[48] It was designed primarily by Steve Wozniak. Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II’s unusual case[11] and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply.[49]\n Jobs usually went to work wearing a black long-sleeved mock turtleneck made by Issey Miyake (it was sometimes reported as St. Croix brand), Levi’s 501 blue jeans, and New Balance 991 sneakers.[50][51] He said his choice was inspired by that of Stuart Geman, a noted applied mathematics professor at Brown University. Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson “…he came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself, both because of its daily convenience (the rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature style.”[50]\n Jobs and Apple became more successful, and his relationship with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now a part of their relationship, and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino.[17] Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple .[17][52] Brennan’s relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take “a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples.”[17] Both Holt and Jobs felt that it would be a good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan’s decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan “turned ugly” at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: “I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn’t want to do that.”[17] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her.[11] Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could “be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don’t get what the problem is.”[17] Brennan however notes that she “felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous. I could not have endured it.”[17]\n Brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple. She stated that Jobs told her “If you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry” and “I am never going to help you.”[17] Now alone, Brennan was on welfare and cleaning houses to earn money. She would sometimes ask Jobs for money but he always refused. Brennan hid her pregnancy for as long as she could, living in a variety of homes and continuing her work with Zen meditation. At the same time, according to Brennan, Jobs “started to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child.” A few weeks before she was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm in Oregon and she accepted the offer.[17] When Jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him)[11] Brennan gave birth to her baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978.[17][53]\n “Dear Mike, This morning’s papers carried suggestions that Apple is considering removing me as chairman. I don’t know the source of these reports, but they are both misleading to the public and unfair to me. You will recall that at last Thursday’s Board meeting I stated I had decided to start a new venture, and I tendered my resignation as chairman. The Board declined to accept my resignation and asked me to defer it for a week. I agreed to do so in light of the encouragement the Board offered with regard to the proposed new venture and the indications that Apple would invest in it. On Friday, after I told John Sculley who would be joining me, he confirmed Apple’s willingness to discuss areas of possible collaboration between Apple and my new venture. Subsequently the Company appears to be adopting a hostile posture toward me and the new venture. Accordingly, I must insist upon the immediate acceptance of my resignation. I would hope that in any statement it feels it must issue, the Company will make it clear that the decision to resign as chairman was mine. I find myself both saddened and perplexed by the management’s conduct in this matter which seems to me contrary to Apple’s best interests. Those interests remain a matter of deep concern to me, both because of my past association with Apple and the substantial investment I retain in it. I continue to hope that calmer voices within the Company may yet be heard. Some Company representatives have said they fear I will use proprietary Apple technology in my new venture. There is no basis for any such concern. If that concern is the real source of Apple’s hostility to the venture, I can allay it. As you know, the company’s recent re-organization left me with no work to do and no access even to regular management reports. I am but 30 and want still to contribute and achieve. After what we have accomplished together, I would wish our parting to be both amicable and dignified. Yours sincerely, Steven P. Jobs.”\n —Steve Jobs, letter of resignation from Apple Computer, September 17th, 1985.[14]\n Jobs went there for the birth after he was contacted by Robert Friedland, their mutual friend and owner of the All One Farm. While distant, Jobs worked with her on a name for the baby, which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket. Brennan suggested the name “Lisa” which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name “Lisa” while he “was also publicly denying paternity.” She would discover later that during this time, Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name (his first choice was “Claire” after St. Clare). She also stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby’s name for a computer and he hid the plans from her. Jobs also worked with his team to come up with the phrase, “Local Integrated Software Architecture” as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa[54] (decades later, however, Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that “obviously, it was named for my daughter”[55]). Brennan would come under intense criticism from Jobs, who claimed that “she doesn’t want money, she just wants me.” According to Brennan, Apple’s Mike Scott wanted Jobs to give her money, while other Apple executives “advised him to ignore me or fight if I tried to go after a paternity settlement.”[17]\n When Jobs denied paternity, a DNA test established him as Lisa’s father. It required him to give Brennan $385 a month in addition to returning the welfare money she had received. Jobs gave her $500 a month at the time when Apple went public, and Jobs became a millionaire. Brennan worked as a waitress in Palo Alto. Later, Brennan agreed to give an interview with Michael Moritz for Time magazine for its Time Person of the Year special, released on January 3, 1983, in which she discussed her relationship with Jobs. Rather than name Jobs the Person of the Year, the magazine named the computer the “Machine of the Year”.[56] In the issue, Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test (which stated that the “probability of paternity for Jobs, Steven… is 94.1%”).[57] Jobs responded by arguing that “28% of the male population of the United States could be the father.”[17][57] Time also noted that “the baby girl and the machine on which Apple has placed so much hope for the future share the same name: Lisa.”[57]\n Jobs was worth a million dollars when he was 23 in 1978, 10 million when he was 24, and over 100 million when he was 25. He was also one of the youngest “people ever to make the Forbes list of the nation’s richest people – and one of only a handful to have done it themselves, without inherited wealth.”[14]\n In 1978, Apple recruited Mike Scott from National Semiconductor to serve as CEO for what turned out to be several turbulent years. In 1983, Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as Apple’s CEO, asking, “Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?”[58]\n In 1982, Jobs bought an apartment in the two top floors of The San Remo, a Manhattan building with a politically progressive reputation. Although he never lived there,[59] he spent years renovating it with the help of I. M. Pei. In 2003, he sold it to U2 singer Bono.\n In 1984, Jobs bought the Jackling House and estate, and resided there for a decade. After that, he leased it out for several years until 2000 when he stopped maintaining the house, allowing exposure to the weather to degrade it. In 2004, Jobs received permission from the town of Woodside to demolish the house in order to build a smaller contemporary styled one. After a few years in court, the house was finally demolished in 2011, a few months before he died.[60]\n In early 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh, which was based on The Lisa (and Xerox PARC’s mouse-driven graphical user interface).[61][62] The following year, Apple aired a Super Bowl television commercial titled “1984.” At Apple’s annual shareholders meeting on January 24, 1984, an emotional Jobs introduced the Macintosh to a wildly enthusiastic audience; Andy Hertzfeld described the scene as “pandemonium.”[63]\n Despite the fanfare, the expensive Macintosh was a hard sell.[64] Shortly after its release in 1985, Bill Gates’s then-developing company, Microsoft, threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless it was granted “a license for the Mac operating system software. Microsoft was developing its graphical user interface … for DOS, which it was calling Windows and didn’t want Apple to sue over the similarities between the Windows GUI and the Mac interface.”[65] Sculley granted Microsoft the license which later led to problems for Apple.[65] In addition, cheap IBM PC clones that ran on Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear. Although the Macintosh preceded the clones, it was far more expensive, so “through the late ’80s, the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple.”[66] Windows based IBM-PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM’s TopView or Digital Research’s GEM,[66] and thus “the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac…it seemed clear as the ’80s wound down that Apple couldn’t go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market.”[66]\n External video\n Machine That Changed The World, The; Paperback Computer, The; Interview with Steve Jobs, 1990, 50:08, 05/14/1990, WGBH Media Library &amp; Archives[67]\n Sculley’s and Jobs’s respective visions for the company greatly differed. The former favored open architecture computers like the Apple II, sold to education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company to focus on the closed architecture Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the board Jobs’s Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services.[68] Although its products provided 85% of Apple’s sales in early 1985, the company’s January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees. Many left including Wozniak, who stated that the company had “been going in the wrong direction for the last five years” and sold most of his stock.[69] The Macintosh’s failure to defeat the PC strengthened Sculley’s position in the company.\n In May 1985, Sculley—encouraged by Arthur Rock—decided to reorganize Apple, and proposed a plan to the board that would remove Jobs from the Macintosh group and put him in charge of “New Product Development.” This move would effectively render Jobs powerless within Apple.[14] In response, Jobs then developed a plan to get rid of Sculley and take over Apple. However, Jobs was confronted after the plan was leaked, and he said that he would leave Apple. The Board declined his resignation and asked him to reconsider. Sculley also told Jobs that he had all of the votes needed to go ahead with the reorganization. A few months later, on September 17, 1985, Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to the Apple Board. Five additional senior Apple employees also resigned and joined Jobs in his new venture, NeXT.[14]\n 1985–1997\n NeXT computer\n See also: NeXT\n Following his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT Inc.[70] with $7 million. A year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon. Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in the company.[71] The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs’s comeback event,[72] a lavish invitation only gala launch event[73] that was described as a multimedia extravaganza.[74] The celebration was held at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, California on Wednesday October 12, 1988.\n NeXT workstations were first released in 1990 and priced at US$9,999. Like the Apple Lisa, the NeXT workstation was technologically advanced and designed for the education sector, but was largely dismissed as cost-prohibitive for educational institutions.[75] The NeXT workstation was known for its technical strengths, chief among them its object-oriented software development system. Jobs marketed NeXT products to the financial, scientific, and academic community, highlighting its innovative, experimental new technologies, such as the Mach kernel, the digital signal processor chip, and the built-in Ethernet port. Making use of a NeXT computer, English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN in Switzerland.[76]\n The revised, second generation NeXTcube was released in 1990. Jobs touted it as the first “interpersonal” computer that would replace the personal computer. With its innovative NeXTMail multimedia email system, NeXTcube could share voice, image, graphics, and video in email for the first time. “Interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and groupwork”, Jobs told reporters.[77] Jobs ran NeXT with an obsession for aesthetic perfection, as evidenced by the development of and attention to NeXTcube’s magnesium case.[78] This put considerable strain on NeXT’s hardware division, and in 1993, after having sold only 50,000 machines, NeXT transitioned fully to software development with the release of NeXTSTEP/Intel.[79] The company reported its first profit of $1.03 million in 1994.[71] In 1996, NeXT Software, Inc. released WebObjects, a framework for Web application development. After NeXT was acquired by Apple Inc. in 1997, WebObjects was used to build and run the Apple Store,[79] MobileMe services, and the iTunes Store.\n Pixar and Disney\n In 1986, Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm’s computer graphics division for the price of $10 million, $5 million of which was given to the company as capital and $5 million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights.[9]\n The first film produced by Pixar with its Disney partnership, Toy Story (1995), with Jobs credited as executive producer,[80] brought fame and critical acclaim to the studio when it was released. Over the next 15 years, under Pixar’s creative chief John Lasseter, the company produced box-office hits A Bug’s Life (1998); Toy Story 2 (1999); Monsters, Inc. (2001); Finding Nemo (2003); The Incredibles (2004); Cars (2006); Ratatouille (2007); WALL-E (2008); Up (2009); and Toy Story 3 (2010). Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up and Toy Story 3 each received the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, an award introduced in 2001.[81]\n In 2003 and 2004, as Pixar’s contract with Disney was running out, Jobs and Disney chief executive Michael Eisner tried but failed to negotiate a new partnership,[82] and in early 2004, Jobs announced that Pixar would seek a new partner to distribute its films after its contract with Disney expired.\n In October 2005, Bob Iger replaced Eisner at Disney, and Iger quickly worked to mend relations with Jobs and Pixar. On January 24, 2006, Jobs and Iger announced that Disney had agreed to purchase Pixar in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4 billion. When the deal closed, Jobs became The Walt Disney Company’s largest single shareholder with approximately seven percent of the company’s stock.[83] Jobs’s holdings in Disney far exceeded those of Eisner, who holds 1.7 percent, and of Disney family member Roy E. Disney, who until his 2009 death held about one percent of the company’s stock and whose criticisms of Eisner – especially that he soured Disney’s relationship with Pixar – accelerated Eisner’s ousting. Upon completion of the merger, Jobs received 7% of Disney shares, and joined the board of directors as the largest individual shareholder.[83][84][85] Upon Jobs’s death his shares in Disney were transferred to the Steven P. Jobs Trust led by Laurene Jobs.[86]\n Floyd Norman, of Pixar, described Jobs as a “mature, mellow individual” who never interfered with the creative process of the filmmakers.[87] In early June 2014, Pixar cofounder and Walt Disney Animation Studios President Ed Catmull revealed that Jobs once advised him to “just explain it to them until they understand” in disagreements. Catmull released the book Creativity Inc. in 2014, in which he recounts numerous experiences of working with Jobs. Regarding his own manner of dealing with Jobs, Catmull writes:\n In all the 26 years with Steve, Steve and I never had one of these loud verbal arguments and it’s not my nature to do that. … but we did disagree fairly frequently about things. … I would say something to him and he would immediately shoot it down because he could think faster than I could. … I would then wait a week … I’d call him up and I give my counter argument to what he had said and he’d immediately shoot it down. So I had to wait another week, and sometimes this went on for months. But in the end one of three things happened. About a third of the time he said, ‘Oh, I get it, you’re right.’ And that was the end of it. And it was another third of the time in which [I’d] say, ‘Actually I think he is right.’ The other third of the time, where we didn’t reach consensus, he just let me do it my way, never said anything more about it.[88]\n Family\n Steve Jobs’s house in Palo Alto\n Steve Jobs’s house, as viewed from an adjacent sidewalk. Abundant fruit trees are visible next to the house.\n Chrisann Brennan notes that after Jobs was forced out of Apple, “he apologized many times over for his behavior” towards her and Lisa. She also states that Jobs “said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry.”[17] By this time, Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa and when she was nine, Jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from “Lisa Brennan” to “Lisa Brennan-Jobs.”[17] In addition, Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to co-parent Lisa, a change Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister, Mona Simpson (who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs).[17] Jobs found Mona after first finding his birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after he left Apple.[11]\n Jobs did not contact his birth family during Clara’s (his adoptive mother) lifetime, however. He would later tell his official biographer Walter Isaacson: “I never wanted [Paul and Clara] to feel like I didn’t consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents […] I loved them so much that I never wanted them to know of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out.”[11] However, in 1986 when he was 31, Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began to spend a great deal of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption, information that motivated him to find his biological mother. Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant. Although the doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive, he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death. As he died soon afterwards, Jobs was given the letter which stated that “his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble.”[11]\n Jobs only contacted Schieble after Clara died and after he received permission from his father, Paul. In addition, out of respect for Paul, he asked the media not to report on his search.[11] Jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need “to see if she was okay and to thank her, because I’m glad I didn’t end up as an abortion. She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me.”[11] Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though she wasn’t familiar with the history of Apple or Jobs’s role in it) and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers. She said that she regretted giving him up and repeatedly apologized to him for it. Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and would spend Christmas together.[11] When Jobs died in 2011, Schieble was suffering from dementia and living in a nursing home. She was not told about his death.[89]\n During this first visit, Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother.[11] Schieble then arranged for them to meet in New York where Mona worked. Her first impression of Jobs was that “he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy.”[11] Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other.[11] Jobs later told his biographer that “Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me . . . . As we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family. I don’t know what I’d do without her. I can’t imagine a better sister. My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close.”[11]\n “I grew up as an only child, with a single mother. Because we were poor and because I knew my father had emigrated from Syria, I imagined he looked like Omar Sharif. I hoped he would be rich and kind and would come into our lives (and our not-yet-furnished apartment) and help us. Later, after I’d met my father, I tried to believe he’d changed his number and left no forwarding address because he was an idealistic revolutionary, plotting a new world for the Arab people. Even as a feminist, my whole life I’d been waiting for a man to love, who could love me. For decades, I’d thought that man would be my father. When I was 25, I met that man, and he was my brother.”\n —Mona Simpson[90]\n Jobs then learned his family history. Six months after he was given up for adoption, Schieble’s father died, she wed Jandali, and they had a daughter, Mona.[11][10] Jandali states that after finishing his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him[10] (they divorced in 1962).[11] He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time:\n I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn’t know where she was, but since 10 years ago we’ve been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida.[10]\n A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather’s last name thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.[11]\n Jobs told his official biographer that after meeting Simpson, he wanted to become involved in her ongoing search for their father. When he was found working in Sacramento, they decided that only Simpson would meet him. Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching for the restaurant business. He also said that he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that “we’ll never see that baby again. That baby’s gone.” (Simpson did not mention that she had met Jobs).[11] Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that “all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs … oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy and a big tipper.”[11] After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that “it was amazing …. I had been to that restaurant a few times, and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands.”[11] However, Jobs did not want to meet Jandali because “I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn’t trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it … I asked Mona not to tell him about me.”[11] Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked “what is this thing about Steve Jobs?” Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, “My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive … He never contacted Steve.”[11] Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did.[11] Jobs also never showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East.[11] Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, The Lost Father.[11]\n In 1989, Jobs first met his future wife, Laurene Powell, when he gave a lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where she was a student. Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene “was right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn’t take my eyes off of her … kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy.”[18] After the lecture, Jobs met up with her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner. From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the rest of his life.[18] Powell’s father died when she was very young, and her mother raised her in a middle class New Jersey home similar to the one Jobs grew up in. After she received her B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, she spent a short period in high finance but found it didn’t interest her, so she decided to pursue her MBA at Stanford instead. In addition, unlike Jobs, she was athletic and followed professional sports. She also brought as much self-sufficiency to the relationship as he did and was more of a private than public person.[18] Jobs proposed on New Year’s Day 1990 with “a fistful of freshly picked wildflowers.”[18] They married on March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park.[18] Fifty people, including his father, Paul, and his sister, Mona, attended. The ceremony was conducted by Jobs’s guru, Kobun Chino Otogawa. The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of Yosemite’s Half Dome, and the wedding ended with a hike (during which Laurene’s brothers had a snowball fight). Jobs is reported to have said to Mona: “You see, Mona […], Laurene is descended from Joe Namath, and we’re descended from John Muir.”[11]\n Jobs and Powell’s first child, Reed, was born September 1991.[71] Jobs’s father, Paul, died a year and a half later, on March 5, 1993. Jobs and Powell had two more children, Erin, born in August 1995, and Eve, born in 1998.[71] The family lived in Palo Alto, California.[91] A journalist who grew up locally remembered him as owning the house with “the scariest [Hallow’een] decorations in Palo Alto…I don’t remember seeing him. I was busy being terrified.”[92]\n 1997–2011\n Return to Apple\n See also: Apple Inc. § 1997–2007: Return to profitability\n Full-length portrait of man about fifty wearing jeans and a black turtleneck shirt, standing in front of a dark curtain with a white Apple logo\n Jobs on stage at Macworld Conference &amp; Expo, San Francisco, January 11, 2005\n In 1996, Apple announced that it would buy NeXT for $427 million. The deal was finalized in February 1997,[93] bringing Jobs back to the company he had cofounded. Jobs became de facto chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July 1997. He was formally named interim chief executive in September.[94] In March 1998, to concentrate Apple’s efforts on returning to profitability, Jobs terminated a number of projects, such as Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc. In the coming months, many employees developed a fear of encountering Jobs while riding in the elevator, “afraid that they might not have a job when the doors opened. The reality was that Jobs’s summary executions were rare, but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company.”[95] Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.\n With the purchase of NeXT, much of the company’s technology found its way into Apple products, most notably NeXTSTEP, which evolved into Mac OS X. Under Jobs’s guidance, the company increased sales significantly with the introduction of the iMac and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for Apple. At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Jobs officially dropped the “interim” modifier from his title at Apple and became permanent CEO.[96] Jobs quipped at the time that he would be using the title “iCEO”.[97]\n The company subsequently branched out, introducing and improving upon other digital appliances. With the introduction of the iPod portable music player, iTunes digital music software, and the iTunes Store, the company made forays into consumer electronics and music distribution. On June 29, 2007, Apple entered the cellular phone business with the introduction of the iPhone, a multi-touch display cell phone, which also included the features of an iPod and, with its own mobile browser, revolutionized the mobile browsing scene. While nurturing innovation, Jobs also reminded his employees that “real artists ship [deliver product].”[98]\n Jobs had a public war of words with Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell, starting in 1987, when Jobs first criticized Dell for making “un-innovative beige boxes”.[99] On October 6, 1997, at a Gartner Symposium, when Dell was asked what he would do if he ran the then-troubled Apple Computer company, he said: “I’d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.”[100] Then, in 2006, Jobs sent an email to all employees when Apple’s market capitalization rose above Dell’s:\n Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn’t perfect at predicting the future. Based on today’s stock market close, Apple is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today. Steve.[101]\n Jobs was both admired and criticized for his consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship, which has been dubbed the “reality distortion field” and was particularly evident during his keynote speeches (colloquially known as “Stevenotes”) at Macworld Expos and at Apple Worldwide Developers Conferences.[102]\n Jobs was a board member at Gap Inc. from 1999 to 2002.[103]\n Two men in their fifties shown full length sitting in red leather chairs smiling at each other\n Steve Jobs and Bill Gates at the fifth D: All Things Digital conference (D5) in May 2007\n In 2001, Jobs was granted stock options in the amount of 7.5 million shares of Apple with an exercise price of $18.30. It was alleged that the options had been backdated, and that the exercise price should have been $21.10. It was further alleged that Jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of $20,000,000 that he did not report, and that Apple overstated its earnings by that same amount. As a result, Jobs potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil penalties. The case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations,[104] though an independent internal Apple investigation completed on December 29, 2006 found that Jobs was unaware of these issues and that the options granted to him were returned without being exercised in 2003.[105]\n In 2005, Jobs responded to criticism of Apple’s poor recycling programs for e-waste in the US by lashing out at environmental and other advocates at Apple’s annual meeting in Cupertino in April. A few weeks later, Apple announced it would take back iPods for free at its retail stores. The Computer TakeBack Campaign responded by flying a banner from a plane over the Stanford University graduation at which Jobs was the commencement speaker. The banner read “Steve, don’t be a mini-player—recycle all e-waste.”\n In 2006, he further expanded Apple’s recycling programs to any US customer who buys a new Mac. This program includes shipping and “environmentally friendly disposal” of their old systems.[106] The success of Apple’s unique products and services provided several years of stable financial returns, propelling Apple to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company in 2011.[107]\n Jobs was perceived as a demanding perfectionist[108][109] who always aspired to position his businesses and their products at the forefront of the information technology industry by foreseeing and setting innovation and style trends. He summed up this self-concept at the end of his keynote speech at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January 2007, by quoting ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky:\n There’s an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.” And we’ve always tried to do that at Apple. Since the very, very beginning. And we always will.[110]\n On July 1, 2008, a US$7 billion class action suit was filed against several members of the Apple board of directors for revenue lost because of alleged securities fraud.[111][112]\n In a 2011 interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs revealed that he had met with U.S. President Barack Obama, complained about the nation’s shortage of software engineers, and told Obama that he was “headed for a one-term presidency”.[113] Jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a U.S. university should automatically be offered a green card. After the meeting, Jobs commented, “The president is very smart, but he kept explaining to us reasons why things can’t get done . . . . It infuriates me.”[113]\n Health issues\n In October 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with cancer.[114] In mid-2004, he announced to his employees that he had a cancerous tumor in his pancreas.[115] The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is usually very poor;[116] Jobs stated that he had a rare, much less aggressive type, known as islet cell neuroendocrine tumor.[115]\n Despite his diagnosis, Jobs resisted his doctors’ recommendations for medical intervention for nine months,[117] instead relying on a pseudo-medicine diet to try natural healing to thwart the disease. According to Harvard researcher Ramzi Amri, his choice of alternative treatment “led to an unnecessarily early death”.[114] Other doctors agree that Jobs’s diet was insufficient to address his disease. Cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski, for instance, said, “My best guess was that Jobs probably only modestly decreased his chances of survival, if that.”[118] Barrie R. Cassileth, the chief of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s integrative medicine department,[119] said, “Jobs’s faith in alternative medicine likely cost him his life…. He had the only kind of pancreatic cancer that is treatable and curable…. He essentially committed suicide.”[120] According to Jobs’s biographer, Walter Isaacson, “for nine months he refused to undergo surgery for his pancreatic cancer – a decision he later regretted as his health declined”.[121] “Instead, he tried a vegan diet, acupuncture, herbal remedies, and other treatments he found online, and even consulted a psychic. He was also influenced by a doctor who ran a clinic that advised juice fasts, bowel cleansings and other unproven approaches, before finally having surgery in July 2004.”[122] He eventually underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (or “Whipple procedure”) in July 2004, that appeared to remove the tumor successfully.[123][124] Jobs did not receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy.[115][125] During Jobs’s absence, Tim Cook, head of worldwide sales and operations at Apple, ran the company.[115]\n In early August 2006, Jobs delivered the keynote for Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference. His “thin, almost gaunt” appearance and unusually “listless” delivery,[126][127] together with his choice to delegate significant portions of his keynote to other presenters, inspired a flurry of media and Internet speculation about the state of his health.[128] In contrast, according to an Ars Technica journal report, Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) attendees who saw Jobs in person said he “looked fine”.[129] Following the keynote, an Apple spokesperson said that “Steve’s health is robust.”[130]\n Two years later, similar concerns followed Jobs’s 2008 WWDC keynote address.[131] Apple officials stated that Jobs was victim to a “common bug” and was taking antibiotics,[132] while others surmised his cachectic appearance was due to the Whipple procedure.[125] During a July conference call discussing Apple earnings, participants responded to repeated questions about Jobs’s health by insisting that it was a “private matter”. Others said that shareholders had a right to know more, given Jobs’s hands-on approach to running his company.[133][134] Based on an off-the-record phone conversation with Jobs, The New York Times reported, “While his health problems amounted to a good deal more than ‘a common bug’, they weren’t life-threatening and he doesn’t have a recurrence of cancer.”[135]\n On August 28, 2008, Bloomberg mistakenly published a 2500-word obituary of Jobs in its corporate news service, containing blank spaces for his age and cause of death. (News carriers customarily stockpile up-to-date obituaries to facilitate news delivery in the event of a well-known figure’s death.) Although the error was promptly rectified, many news carriers and blogs reported on it,[136] intensifying rumors concerning Jobs’s health.[137] Jobs responded at Apple’s September 2008 Let’s Rock keynote by paraphrasing Mark Twain: “Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.”[138][139] At a subsequent media event, Jobs concluded his presentation with a slide reading “110/70”, referring to his blood pressure, stating he would not address further questions about his health.[140]\n On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that marketing vice-president Phil Schiller would deliver the company’s final keynote address at the Macworld Conference and Expo 2009, again reviving questions about Jobs’s health.[141][142] In a statement given on January 5, 2009, on Apple.com, Jobs said that he had been suffering from a “hormone imbalance” for several months.[143][144]\n On January 14, 2009, Jobs wrote in an internal Apple memo that in the previous week he had “learned that my health-related issues are more complex than I originally thought”.[145] He announced a six-month leave of absence until the end of June 2009, to allow him to better focus on his health. Tim Cook, who previously acted as CEO in Jobs’s 2004 absence, became acting CEO of Apple, with Jobs still involved with “major strategic decisions”.[145]\n In 2009, Tim Cook offered a portion of his liver to Jobs, since both share a rare blood type. (The donor liver can regenerate tissue after such an operation.) Jobs yelled, “I’ll never let you do that. I’ll never do that.”[146]\n In April 2009, Jobs underwent a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in Memphis, Tennessee.[147][148][149] Jobs’s prognosis was described as “excellent”.[147]\n Resignation\n On January 17, 2011, a year and a half after Jobs returned to work following the liver transplant, Apple announced that he had been granted a medical leave of absence. Jobs announced his leave in a letter to employees, stating his decision was made “so he could focus on his health.” As it did at the time of his 2009 medical leave, Apple announced that Tim Cook would run day-to-day operations and that Jobs would continue to be involved in major strategic decisions at the company.[150][151] Despite the leave, Jobs appeared at the iPad 2 launch event (March 2), the WWDC keynote introducing iCloud (June 6), and before the Cupertino City Council (June 7).[152]\n On August 24, 2011, Jobs announced his resignation as Apple’s CEO, writing to the board, “I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.”[153] Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor as CEO.[154][155] Jobs continued to work for Apple until the day before his death six weeks later.[156][157][158]\n Death\n Flags flying at half-staff outside Apple HQ in Cupertino, on the evening of Steve Jobs’s death\n Memorial candles and iPads pay tribute to Steve Jobs outside the Apple Store in Palo Alto, California, shortly after his death.\n Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer,[44][159][160] which resulted in respiratory arrest.[161] He had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side.[90] His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: “Steve’s final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times. Before embarking, he’d looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life’s partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve’s final words were: ‘Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'” He then lost consciousness and died several hours later.[90] A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which were not revealed out of respect for Jobs’s family.[162] At the time of his death, his biological mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, was living in a nursing home and suffering from dementia. She was not told that he died.[89]\n Apple[163] and Pixar each issued announcements of his death.[164] Apple announced on the same day that they had no plans for a public service, but were encouraging “well-wishers” to send their remembrance messages to an email address created to receive such messages.[165] Apple and Microsoft both flew their flags at half-staff throughout their respective headquarters and campuses.[166][167] Bob Iger ordered all Disney properties, including Walt Disney World and Disneyland, to fly their flags at half-staff from October 6 to 12, 2011.[168] For two weeks following his death, Apple displayed on its corporate Web site a simple page that showed Jobs’s name and lifespan next to his grayscale portrait.[169][170][171] On October 19, 2011, Apple employees held a private memorial service for Jobs on the Apple campus in Cupertino. Jobs’s widow, Laurene, was in attendance, as well as Cook, Bill Campbell, Norah Jones, Al Gore, and Coldplay.[172] Some of Apple’s retail stores closed briefly so employees could attend the memorial. A video of the service was uploaded to Apple’s website.[172]\n Governor Jerry Brown of California declared Sunday, October 16, 2011, to be “Steve Jobs Day.”[173] On that day, an invitation-only memorial was held at Stanford University. Those in attendance included Apple and other tech company executives, members of the media, celebrities, close friends of Jobs, and politicians, along with Jobs’s family. Bono, Yo Yo Ma, and Joan Baez performed at the service, which lasted longer than an hour. The service was highly secured, with guards at all of the university’s gates, and a helicopter flying overhead from an area news station.[174][175] Each attendee was given a small brown box as a “farewell gift” from Jobs. The box contained a copy of the Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda.[176]\n Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak,[177] former owner of what would become Pixar, George Lucas,[178] former rival, Microsoft founder Bill Gates,[179] and President Barack Obama[180] all offered statements in response to his death.\n Jobs is buried in an unmarked grave at Alta Mesa Memorial Park, the only nonsectarian cemetery in Palo Alto.[181][182]\n Portrayals and coverage in books, film, and theater\n Main article: List of artistic depictions of Steve Jobs\n Steve Jobs is the subject of a number of books and films.\n Innovations and designs\n Jobs’s design aesthetic was influenced by the modernist architectural style of Joseph Eichler, by the industrial designs of Braun’s Dieter Rams, and by Buddhism. In India, he experienced Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey,[183] and his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied.[183]\n According to Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak “Steve didn’t ever code. He wasn’t an engineer and he didn’t do any original design…”[184][185] Daniel Kottke, one of Apple’s earliest employees and a college friend of Jobs’s, stated that “Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person.”[186]\n He is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves, lanyards and packages. Jobs’s contributions to most of his patents were to “the look and feel of the product.” His industrial design chief Jonathan Ive had his name along with him for 200 of the patents.[187] Most of these are design patents (specific product designs; for example, Jobs listed as primary inventor in patents for both original and lamp-style iMacs, as well as PowerBook G4 Titanium) as opposed to utility patents (inventions).[188][189] He has 43 issued US patents on inventions.[188] The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user interface with “magnification” feature was issued the day before he died.[190] Although Jobs had little involvement in the engineering and technical side of the original Apple computers,[185] Jobs later used his CEO position to directly involve himself with product design.[191]\n Even while terminally ill in the hospital, Jobs sketched new devices that would hold the iPad in a hospital bed.[192] He also despised the oxygen monitor on his finger and suggested ways to revise the design for simplicity.[193]\n Since his death, the former Apple CEO has won 141 patents, more than most inventors win during their lifetimes. Currently, Jobs holds over 450 patents.[194]\n Apple II\n Main article: Apple II\n The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products,[48] designed primarily by Steve Wozniak (Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II’s unusual case[11] and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply[49]). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer.\n Apple Lisa\n Main article: Apple Lisa\n The Lisa is a personal computer designed by Apple Computer, Inc. during the early 1980s. It was the first personal computer to offer a graphical user interface in a machine aimed at individual business users. Development of the Lisa began in 1978.[195] The Lisa sold poorly, with only 100,000 units sold.[196]\n In 1982, after Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project,[197] he joined the Macintosh project. The Macintosh is not a direct descendant of Lisa, although there are obvious similarities between the systems. The final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.[198]\n Macintosh\n Main article: Macintosh\n Jobs introduced the original Macintosh computer on January 24, 1984. This was the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse.[199] This first model was later renamed to “Macintosh 128k” for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models which are also based on Apple’s same proprietary architecture. Since 1998, Apple has largely phased out the Macintosh name in favor of “Mac”, though the product family has been nicknamed “Mac” or “the Mac” since the development of the first model. The Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, “1984”.[200] It most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, and is now considered a “watershed event”[201] and a “masterpiece.”[202] Regis McKenna called the ad “more successful than the Mac itself.”[203] “1984” used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the “conformity” of IBM’s attempts to dominate the computer industry. The ad alludes to George Orwell’s novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised “Big Brother.”[204][205]\n The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses.[206] Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade.\n NeXT Computer\n Main article: NeXT Computer\n After Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he started a company that built workstation computers. The NeXT Computer was introduced in 1988 at a lavish launch event. Tim Berners-Lee created the world’s first web browser (WorldWideWeb) using the NeXT Computer. The NeXT Computer was the basis for today’s macOS (formerly OS X) and iOS (formerly iPhone OS).[207][208]\n iMac\n Main article: iMac\n Apple iMac was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs’s return to Apple. Apple boasted “the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else’s.”[209] Described as “cartoonlike”, the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep.[210] The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. The iMac also featured some technical innovations, such as having USB ports as the only device inputs. This latter change resulted, through the iMac’s success, in the interface being popularised among third party peripheral makers – as evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).[211]\n iTunes\n Main article: iTunes\n iTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed by Apple Inc. It is used to play, download, and organize digital audio and video (as well as other types of media available on the iTunes Store) on personal computers running the macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems. The iTunes Store is also available on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad.\n Through the iTunes Store, users can purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, audiobooks, podcasts, movies, and movie rentals in some countries, and ringtones, available on the iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth generation onward). Application software for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch can be downloaded from the App Store.\n iPod\n Main article: iPod\n The first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8″ hard drive compared to the 2.5″ drives common to players at that time. The capacity of the first generation iPod ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB.[212] The iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001.

States (U.S.) or America (/əˈmɛrɪkə/), is a federal republic[14][15] composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions.[fn 6] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2)[17] and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world’s third- or fourth-largest country by total area[fn 7] and the third-most populous. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the largest city by population is New York City. Forty-eight states and the capital’s federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia to the west. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine official time zones. The extremely diverse geography, climate, and wildlife of the United States make it one of the world’s 17 megadiverse countries.[22]</p>\n <p>United States of America<br>\n Flag of the United States<br>\n Flag<br>\n Great Seal of the United States<br>\n Great Seal<br>\n Motto:<br>\n “In God We Trust”[1][fn 1]<br>\n Other traditional mottos<br>\n “E pluribus unum” (Latin) (de facto)<br>\n “Out of many, one”<br>\n “Annuit cœptis” (Latin)<br>\n “He has favored our undertakings”<br>\n “Novus ordo seclorum” (Latin)<br>\n “New order of the ages”<br>\n Anthem: “The Star-Spangled Banner”</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>March: “The Stars and Stripes Forever”[2][3]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Projection of North America with the United States in green<br>\n The contiguous United States plus Alaska and Hawaii<br>\n The United States and its territories<br>\n The United States including its territories<br>\n Capital Washington, D.C.<br>\n 38°53′N 77°01′W<br>\n Largest city New York City<br>\n 40°43′N 74°00′W<br>\n Official languages None at federal level[fn 2]<br>\n National language English[fn 3]<br>\n Ethnic groups (2016[6]) By race:<br>\n 77.1% White<br>\n 13.3% Black<br>\n 5.6% Asian<br>\n 2.6% Other/multiracial<br>\n 1.2% Native<br>\n 0.2% Pacific Islander<br>\n Ethnicity:<br>\n 17.6% Hispanic or Latino<br>\n 82.4% non-Hispanic or Latino<br>\n Religion (2015[7]) 70.6% Christian<br>\n 22.8% Unaffiliated<br>\n 1.9% Jewish<br>\n 0.9% Muslim<br>\n 0.7% Buddhist<br>\n 0.7% Hindu<br>\n 1.8% Other faiths<br>\n Demonym American<br>\n Government Federal presidential constitutional republic<br>\n • President<br>\n Donald Trump<br>\n • Vice President<br>\n Mike Pence<br>\n • Speaker of the House<br>\n Paul Ryan<br>\n • Chief Justice<br>\n John Roberts<br>\n Legislature Congress<br>\n • Upper house<br>\n Senate<br>\n • Lower house<br>\n House of Representatives<br>\n Independence from Great Britain<br>\n • Declaration<br>\n July 4, 1776<br>\n • Confederation<br>\n March 1, 1781<br>\n • Treaty of Paris<br>\n September 3, 1783<br>\n • Constitution<br>\n June 21, 1788<br>\n • Last polity admitted<br>\n March 24, 1976<br>\n Area<br>\n • Total area<br>\n 3,796,742 sq mi (9,833,520 km2) (3rd/4th)<br>\n • Water (%)<br>\n 6.97<br>\n • Total land area<br>\n 3,531,905 sq mi (9,147,590 km2)<br>\n Population<br>\n • 2017 estimate<br>\n 325,365,189[8] (3rd)<br>\n • 2010 census<br>\n 308,745,538[9] (3rd)<br>\n • Density<br>\n 90.6/sq mi (35.0/km2) (180th)<br>\n GDP (PPP) 2016 estimate<br>\n • Total<br>\n $18.558 trillion[10] (2nd)<br>\n • Per capita<br>\n $57,220[10] (14th)<br>\n GDP (nominal) 2016 estimate<br>\n • Total<br>\n $18.558 trillion[10] (1st)<br>\n • Per capita<br>\n $57,467[11] (7th)<br>\n Gini (2013) Negative increase 41.1[12]<br>\n medium<br>\n HDI (2015) Increase 0.920[13]<br>\n very high · 10th<br>\n Currency United States dollar ($) (USD)<br>\n Time zone (UTC−4 to −12, +10, +11)<br>\n • Summer (DST)<br>\n (UTC−4 to −10[fn 4])<br>\n Date format mm/dd/yyyy (AD)<br>\n Drives on the right[fn 5]<br>\n Calling code +1<br>\n ISO 3166 code US<br>\n Internet TLD .us<br>\n Website<br>\n usa.gov</p>\n <p><a href=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4466.png target=_blank><img data-attachment-id=125 data-permalink=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/the-united-states-of-america/img_4466/ data-orig-file=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4466.png data-orig-size=674,837 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=img_4466 data-image-description data-medium-file=\"https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4466.png?w=242\" data-large-file=\"https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4466.png?w=674\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-125\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4466.png?w=676\" alt srcset=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4466.png 674w, https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.wordpress.com/author/thearyanyadavfoundation/page/2/ https:/thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4466.png?w=121 121w, https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.wordpress.com/author/thearyanyadavfoundation/page/2/ https:/thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4466.png?w=242 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\"></a><br>\n Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago.[23] European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies following the French and Indian War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775, and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power.[24] The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories,[25] displacing Native American tribes, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848.[25] During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the outlawing of slavery.[26][27] By the end of the century, the United States had extended into the Pacific Ocean,[28] and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.[29] The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country’s status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race, culminating with the 1969 moon landing. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world’s sole superpower.[30]</p>\n <p>The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world’s largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP.[31] The U.S. economy is the fastest-growing in the Americas[32][33] and is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world.[34] Though its population is only 4.3% of the world total,[8] Americans hold 33.2% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country.[35] The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage,[36] human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person.[37] The U.S. is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending.[38] It is also a global leader in science and technology.</p>\n <p>Contents<br>\n Etymology</p>\n <p>See also: Naming of America, Names for United States citizens, and American (word)</p>\n <p>The Americas are named after Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci.[39]<br>\n In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere the Americas in honor of the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci (Latin: Americus Vespucius).[40] The first documentary evidence of the phrase “United States of America” is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., George Washington’s aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army. Addressed to Lt. Col. Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed his wish to carry the “full and ample powers of the United States of America” to Spain to assist in the revolutionary war effort.[41][42][43] The first known publication of the phrase “United States of America” was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[44]</p>\n <p>The second draft of the Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared “The name of this Confederation shall be the ‘United States of America'”.[45] The final version of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence “The Stile of this Confederacy shall be ‘The United States of America'”.[46] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA” in all capitalized letters in the headline of his “original Rough draught” of the Declaration of Independence.[45] This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.[45]</p>\n <p>The short form “United States” is also standard. Other common forms are the “U.S.”, the “USA”, and “America”. Colloquial names are the “U.S. of A.” and, internationally, the “States”. “Columbia”, a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the name “District of Columbia”.[47]</p>\n <p>The phrase “United States” was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states–e.g., “the United States are”–including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865.[48] The singular form–e.g., “the United States is”–became popular after the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom “these United States”. The difference is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.[49]</p>\n <p>A citizen of the United States is an “American”. “United States”, “American” and “U.S.” refer to the country adjectivally (“American values”, “U.S. forces”). In English, the word “American” rarely refers to topics or subjects not connected with the United States.[50]</p>\n <p>History</p>\n <p>Main articles: History of the United States, Timeline of United States history, American business history, Economic history of the United States, and Labor history of the United States<br>\n Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history<br>\n Further information: Pre-Columbian era and Colonial history of the United States</p>\n <p>Artist’s re-creation of the Kincaid Site from the prehistoric Mississippian culture, as it may have looked[51]<br>\n The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[52] After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward, either along the Pacific coast[53][54] or through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets.[55] The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and it is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas.[56] While the Clovis culture was thought, throughout the late 20th century, to represent the first human settlement of the Americas,[57] in recent years consensus has changed in recognition of pre-Clovis cultures.[58]</p>\n <p>Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies.[59] From approximately 800 to 1600 AD[60] the Mississippian culture flourished, and its largest city Cahokia is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States.[61] In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point between the twelfth[62] and fifteenth centuries,[63] lasting until the end of the Revolutionary War.[64]</p>\n <p>The date of the first settlements of the Hawaiian Islands is a topic of continuing debate.[65] Archaeological evidence seems to indicate a settlement as early as 124 AD.[66] During his third and final voyage, Captain James Cook became the first European to begin formal contact with Hawaii.[67] After his initial landfall in January 1778 at Waimea harbour, Kauai, Cook named the archipelago the “Sandwich Islands” after the fourth Earl of Sandwich–the acting First Lord of the Admiralty of the British Royal Navy.[68]</p>\n <p>European settlements<br>\n Further information: European colonization of the Americas and Thirteen Colonies</p>\n <p>Saint Augustine, Florida, the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States (1565)[69]</p>\n <p>The Mayflower Compact, 1620 by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris<br>\n After Spain sent Columbus on his first voyage to the New World in 1492, other explorers followed. The first Europeans to arrive in territory of the modern United States were Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made his first visit to Florida in 1513; however, if unincorporated territories are accounted for, then credit would go to Christopher Columbus who landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage. Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine[69] and Santa Fe. The French established their own as well along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims’ Plymouth Colony in 1620. Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent’s first elected legislative assembly, Virginia’s House of Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[70][71]</p>\n <p>Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world’s iron supply.[72] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.[73]</p>\n <p>A large-scale slave trade with English privateers was begun.[74] The life expectancy of slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves.[75][76] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.[77][78] But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.[79]</p>\n <p>With the British colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America were established.[80] All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism.[81] With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.[82] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.[83]</p>\n <p>During the Seven Years’ War (in America, known as the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[84] The colonies’ distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.[85]</p>\n <p>In 1774 the Spanish Navy ship Santiago, under Juan Pérez had entered and anchored in the inlet at Nootka Sound. Although the Spanish did not land, natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from California.[86] At the time, the Spanish were able to monopolize the trade between Asia and North America, granting limited licenses to the Portuguese. When the Russians began establishing a growing fur trading system in Alaska the Spanish began to challenge the Russians, with Pérez’s voyage being the first of many to the Pacific Northwest.[87][fn 8]</p>\n <p>After having arrived in the Hawaiian islands in 1778, Captain Cook sailed north and then north-east to explore the west coast of North America north of the Spanish settlements in Alta California. He made landfall on the Oregon coast at approximately 44°30′ north latitude, naming his landing point Cape Foulweather. Bad weather forced his ships south to about 43° north before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward.[89] In March 1778, Cook landed on Bligh Island and named the inlet “King George’s Sound”. He recorded that the native name was Nutka or Nootka, apparently misunderstanding his conversations at Friendly Cove/Yuquot; his informant may have been explaining that he was on an island (itchme nutka, a place you can “go around”). There may also have been confusion with Nuu-chah-nulth, the natives’ autonym (name for themselves). It may also have simply been based on Cook’s mispronunciation of Yuquot, the native name of the place.[90]</p>\n <p>Effects on and interaction with native populations<br>\n Further information: American Indian Wars, Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas, and James Cook<br>\n With the progress of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced.[91] The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles. Violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline among Native Americans, though conflict among themselves and with Europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial settlements.[92][93][94][95][96][97]</p>\n <p>In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.[98] Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to “civilize” the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles.[99][100]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Death of Captain Cook by Johann Zoffany (1795)<br>\n Captain James Cook’s last voyage included sailing along the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. He returned to the Hawaii to resupply, initially exploring the coasts of Maui and the big island, trading with locals and then making anchor at Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. When his ships and company left the islands, a ship’s mast broke in bad weather, forcing them to return in mid-February. Cook would be killed days later.[101] [fn 9][fn 10]</p>\n <p>Independence and expansion (1776–1865)<br>\n Further information: American Revolutionary War, United States Declaration of Independence, American Revolution, and Territorial evolution of the United States</p>\n <p>Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull<br>\n The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of “republicanism” asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen and “no taxation without representation”. The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.[114]</p>\n <p>Following the passage of the Lee Resolution, on July 2, 1776, which was the actual vote for independence, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, which proclaimed, in a long preamble, that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great Britain, and declared, in the words of the resolution, that the Thirteen Colonies were independent states and had no allegiance to the British crown in the United States. The fourth day of July is celebrated annually as Independence Day.[115] The Second Continental Congress declared on September 9 “where, heretofore, the words ‘United Colonies’ have been used, the stile be altered for the future to the ‘United States’ “.[116] In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789.[115]</p>\n <p>Britain recognized the independence of the United States following their defeat at Yorktown in 1781.[117] In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[118]</p>\n <p>Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population.[119][120][121] The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[122] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[123]</p>\n <p>Americans’ eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars.[124] The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation’s area.[125] The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism.[126] A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[127] Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America’s large water systems, which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&amp;M; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation’s land.[128]</p>\n <p>From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider white male suffrage; it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny.[129] The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[130] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.[131]</p>\n <p>The California Gold Rush of 1848–49 spurred western migration and the creation of additional western states.[132] After the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[133] Over a half-century, the loss of the American bison (sometimes called “buffalo”) was an existential blow to many Plains Indians cultures.[134] In 1869, a new Peace Policy sought to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship, although conflicts, including several of the largest Indian Wars, continued throughout the West into the 1900s.[135]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>The Statue of Liberty in New York City, dedicated in 1886, is a symbol of the United States as well as its ideals of freedom, democracy and opportunity.[136]<br>\n Civil War and Reconstruction Era<br>\n Further information: American Civil War and Reconstruction Era</p>\n <p>The Battle of Gettysburg by Thure de Thulstrup<br>\n Differences of opinion over social order between northern and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans, ultimately led to the American Civil War.[137] Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.[138]</p>\n <p>With the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America, while the federal government maintained that secession was illegal.[138] The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863 as casualties mounted and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, a second war aim became abolition of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.[139]</p>\n <p>Following the Union victory in 1865, three amendments were added to the U.S. Constitution: the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited slavery, the Fourteenth Amendment provided citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves,[140] and the Fifteenth Amendment ensured that they had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power[141] aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves.</p>\n <p>Southern white conservatives, calling themselves “Redeemers” took control after the end of Reconstruction. By the 1890–1910 period Jim Crow laws disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites. Blacks faced racial segregation, especially in the South.[142] Racial minorities occasionally experienced vigilante violence.[143]</p>\n <p>Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization<br>\n Main articles: Economic history of the United States and Technological and industrial history of the United States</p>\n <p>Ellis Island, in New York City, was a major gateway for European immigration[144]<br>\n In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country’s industrialization and transformed its culture.[145] National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.[146]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>United States and its territories at their greatest extent from 1898 to 1902<br>\n The end of the Indian Wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets.[147] Mainland expansion was completed by the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[148] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War.[149]</p>\n <p>Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation’s progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The American economy boomed, becoming the world’s largest, and the United States achieved great power status.[150] These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[151] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women’s suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.[152][153][154]</p>\n <p>World War I, Great Depression, and World War II<br>\n Further information: World War I, Great Depression, and World War II</p>\n <p>Crowd gathering on Wall Street after the 1929 crash<br>\n The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I, in 1914, until 1917 when it joined the war as an “associated power”, alongside the formal Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this, and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[155]</p>\n <p>In 1920, the women’s rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women’s suffrage.[156] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television.[157] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system.[158] The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s;[159] whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[160]</p>\n <p>At first effectively neutral during World War II while Germany conquered much of continental Europe, the United States began supplying material to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers.[161] During the war, the United States was referred as one of the “Four Policemen”[162] of Allies power who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union and China.[163][164] Though the nation lost more than 400,000 soldiers,[165] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[166]</p>\n <p>The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences with the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and other Allies, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe’s postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[167] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; causing the Japanese to surrender on September 2, ending World War II.[168][169] Parades and celebrations followed in what is known as Victory Day, or V-J Day.[170]</p>\n <p>Cold War and civil rights era<br>\n Main articles: History of the United States (1945–64), History of the United States (1964–80), and History of the United States (1980–91)<br>\n Further information: Cold War, Civil Rights Movement, War on Poverty, Space Race, and Reaganomics</p>\n <p>U.S. President Ronald Reagan at his “Tear down this wall!” speech in Berlin, Germany on June 12, 1987.[171]<br>\n After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what became known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism[172] and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.</p>\n <p>The United States often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored. American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–53.[173] The Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a “Space Race” in which the United States became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969.[173] A proxy war in Southeast Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War.</p>\n <p>At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation’s infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[174][175] In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state added to the country.[176] The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination.[177][178][179] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the sexual revolution.</p>\n <p>The launch of a “War on Poverty” expanded entitlements and welfare spending, including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that provide health coverage to the elderly and poor, respectively, and the means-tested Food Stamp Program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.[180]</p>\n <p>The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned “containment” and initiated the more aggressive “rollback” strategy towards the USSR.[181][182][183][184][185] After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[186]</p>\n <p>The late 1980s brought a “thaw” in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.[187][188][189][190] This brought about unipolarity[191] with the U.S. unchallenged as the world’s dominant superpower. The concept of Pax Americana, which had appeared in the post-World War II period, gained wide popularity as a term for the post-Cold War new world order.</p>\n <p>Contemporary history<br>\n Main articles: History of the United States (1991–2008) and History of the United States (2008–present)<br>\n Further information: Gulf War, September 11 attacks, War on Terror, 2008 financial crisis, and Affordable Care Act</p>\n <p>The World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan during the September 11 attacks in 2001</p>\n <p>One World Trade Center, newly-built in its place<br>\n After the Cold War, the conflict in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Sadaam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.[192]</p>\n <p>Originating in U.S. defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic networks, and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the global economy, society, and culture.[193]</p>\n <p>Due to the dot-com boom, stable monetary policy under Alan Greenspan, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001.[194] Beginning in 1994, the U.S. entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), linking 450 million people producing $17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade among the three partners has soared since NAFTA went into force.[195]</p>\n <p>On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[196] In response, the United States launched the War on Terror, which included war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.[197][198] In 2007, the Bush administration ordered a major troop surge in the Iraq War,[199] which successfully reduced violence and led to greater stability in the region.[200][201]</p>\n <p>Government policy designed to promote affordable housing,[202] widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance,[203] and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve[204] led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the largest economic contraction in the nation’s history since the Great Depression.[205] Barack Obama, the first African American[206] and multiracial[207] president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis,[208] and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements[209] and a relative decline in unemployment.[210] Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection,[211] although there is evidence it may have had a negative impact on small banks.[212]</p>\n <p>In 2010, the Obama administration passed the Affordable Care Act, which made the most sweeping reforms to the nation’s healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused a significant reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016,[213] but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance.[214] Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama’s policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.[215]</p>\n <p>American forces in Iraq were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and the war in the region was declared formally over in December 2011.[216] The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency,[217] leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region.[218] In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time since 1961.[needs update][219] The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran’s nuclear program.[220]</p>\n <p>Geography, climate, and environment</p>\n <p>Main articles: Geography of the United States, Climate of the United States, and Environment of the United States</p>\n <p>A composite satellite image of the contiguous United States and surrounding areas</p>\n <p>Köppen climate classifications<br>\n The land area of the contiguous United States is 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940.6 km2). Alaska, separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles (1,717,856.2 km2). Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. The populated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2).[221] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.[222]</p>\n <p>The United States is the world’s third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted and how the total size of the United States is measured: calculations range from 3,676,486 square miles (9,522,055.0 km2)[223] to 3,717,813 square miles (9,629,091.5 km2)[224] to 3,796,742 square miles (9,833,516.6 km2).[225]</p>\n <p>The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont.[226] The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[227] The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world’s fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[227]</p>\n <p>The Rocky Mountains, at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[228] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave.[229] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[230] and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[231] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska’s Denali (Mount McKinley) is the highest peak in the country and North America.[232] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska’s Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent’s largest volcanic feature.[233] The United States has the most ecoregions out of any country in the world.[234]</p>\n <p>The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[235] The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[236] Extreme weather is not uncommon–the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world’s tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[237]</p>\n <p>Wildlife<br>\n Main articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States<br>\n See also: Category:Biota of the United States</p>\n <p>The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782.[238]<br>\n The U.S. ecology is megadiverse: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[239] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species.[240] About 91,000 insect species have been described.[241] The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself.[242]</p>\n <p>There are 59 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[243] Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country’s land area.[244] Most of this is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching; about .86% is used for military purposes.[245][246]</p>\n <p>Environmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation,[247][248] and international responses to global warming.[249][250] Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[251] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[252] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.[253]</p>\n <p>Demographics</p>\n <p>Main articles: Demography of the United States, Americans, List of U.S. states by population density, and List of United States cities by population<br>\n Population<br>\n Census Pop. %±<br>\n 1790 3,929,214 —<br>\n 1800 5,308,483 35.1%<br>\n 1810 7,239,881 36.4%<br>\n 1820 9,638,453 33.1%<br>\n 1830 12,866,020 33.5%<br>\n 1840 17,069,453 32.7%<br>\n 1850 23,191,876 35.9%<br>\n 1860 31,443,321 35.6%<br>\n 1870 38,558,371 22.6%<br>\n 1880 50,189,209 30.2%<br>\n 1890 62,979,766 25.5%<br>\n 1900 76,212,168 21.0%<br>\n 1910 92,228,496 21.0%<br>\n 1920 106,021,537 15.0%<br>\n 1930 123,202,624 16.2%<br>\n 1940 132,164,569 7.3%<br>\n 1950 151,325,798 14.5%<br>\n 1960 179,323,175 18.5%<br>\n 1970 203,211,926 13.3%<br>\n 1980 226,545,805 11.5%<br>\n 1990 248,709,873 9.8%<br>\n 2000 281,421,906 13.2%<br>\n 2010 308,745,538 9.7%<br>\n Est. 2016[254] 323,127,513 4.7%<br>\n 1610–1780 population data.[255]<br>\n Note that the census numbers do<br>\n not include Native Americans until 1860.[256]<br>\n The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the country’s population to be 323,425,550 as of April 25, 2016, and to be adding 1 person (net gain) every 13 seconds, or about 6,646 people per day.[8] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from about 76 million in 1900.[257] The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected.[258] In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children, by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56.[259] Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.86 children per woman in 2014. Foreign born immigration has caused the US population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 40 million in 2010, representing one third of the population increase.[260] The foreign born population reached 45 million in 2015.[261][fn 11]</p>\n <p>The United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world average.[265] Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher than that of many developed nations.[266] In fiscal year 2015, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.[267] Mexico has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every year since the 1990s.[268] As of 2012, approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal immigrants.[269] As of 2015, 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing.[261]</p>\n <p>Minorities (as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites) constituted 37.2% of the population in 2012[270] and over 50% of children under age one,[271][272] and are projected to constitute the majority by 2044.[271]</p>\n <p>According to a survey conducted by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender.[273][274] A 2016 Gallup poll also concluded that 4.1% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%.[275] In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.[276]</p>\n <p>In 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry (2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry) and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry (0.5 million exclusively).[277] The census counted more than 19 million people of “Some Other Race” who were “unable to identify with any” of its five official race categories in 2010, over 18.5 million (97%) of whom are of Hispanic ethnicity.[277]</p>\n <p>The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans (the terms are officially interchangeable) is a major demographic trend. The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent[277] are identified as sharing a distinct “ethnicity” by the Census Bureau; 64% of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent.[278] Between 2000 and 2010, the country’s Hispanic population increased 43% while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9%.[279] Much of this growth is from immigration; in 2007, 12.6% of the U.S. population was foreign-born, with 54% of that figure born in Latin America.[280][fn 12]</p>\n <p>About 82% of Americans live in urban areas (including suburbs);[225] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[286] The US has numerous clusters of cities known as megaregions, the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston).[287] There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million.[288] Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South.[289] The metro areas of San Bernardino, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008.[288]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Leading population centers (see complete list) view talk edit<br>\n Rank Core city (cities) Metro area population Metropolitan Statistical Area Region[290]<br>\n New York City<br>\n New York City</p>\n <p>Los Angeles<br>\n Los Angeles</p>\n <p>Chicago<br>\n Chicago</p>\n <p>Dallas<br>\n Dallas</p>\n <p>1 New York 20,153,634 New York–Newark–Jersey City, NY–NJ–PA MSA Northeast<br>\n 2 Los Angeles 13,310,447 Los Angeles–Long Beach–Anaheim, CA MSA West<br>\n 3 Chicago 9,512,999 Chicago–Joliet–Naperville, IL–IN–WI MSA Midwest<br>\n 4 Dallas–Fort Worth 7,233,323 Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington, TX MSA South<br>\n 5 Houston 6,656,947 Houston–The Woodlands-Sugar Land MSA South<br>\n 6 Washington, D.C. 6,772,470 Washington, DC–VA–MD–WV MSA South<br>\n 7 Philadelphia 6,070,500 Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington, PA–NJ–DE–MD MSA Northeast<br>\n 8 Miami 6,066,387 Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach, FL MSA South<br>\n 9 Atlanta 5,789,700 Atlanta–Sandy Springs–Roswell, GA MSA South<br>\n 10 Boston 4,794,447 Boston–Cambridge–Quincy, MA–NH MSA Northeast<br>\n 11 San Francisco 4,679,166 San Francisco–Oakland–Fremont, CA MSA West<br>\n 12 Phoenix 4,661,537 Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, AZ MSA West<br>\n 13 Riverside–San Bernardino 4,527,837 Riverside–San Bernardino–Ontario, CA MSA West<br>\n 14 Detroit 4,297,617 Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI MSA Midwest<br>\n 15 Seattle 3,798,902 Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue, WA MSA West<br>\n 16 Minneapolis–St. Paul 3,551,036 Minneapolis–St. Paul–Bloomington, MN–WI MSA Midwest<br>\n 17 San Diego 3,317,749 San Diego–Carlsbad–San Marcos, CA MSA West<br>\n 18 Tampa–St. Petersburg 3,032,171 Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater, FL MSA South<br>\n 19 Denver 2,853,077 Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO MSA West<br>\n 20 St. Louis 2,807,002 St. Louis MO–IL MSA Midwest<br>\n Based on 2015 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[291]<br>\n Language<br>\n Main article: Languages of the United States<br>\n See also: Language Spoken at Home in the United States of America, List of endangered languages in the United States, and Language education in the United States<br>\n English (American English) is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws–such as U.S. naturalization requirements–standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.[292][293] Some Americans advocate making English the country’s official language, as it is in 32 states.[294]</p>\n <p>Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii, by state law.[295] Alaska recognizes twenty Native languages as well as English.[296] While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[297] Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms.[298]</p>\n <p>Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan[299] and Chamorro[300] are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands;[301] Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico and is more widely spoken than English there.[302]</p>\n <p>The most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate studies, are: Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages (with 100,000 to 250,000 learners) include Latin, Japanese, ASL, Italian, and Chinese.[303][304] 18% of all Americans claim to speak at least one language in addition to English.[305]</p>\n <p>Languages spoken at home by more than 1 million persons in the U.S. (2016)[306][307][fn 13]<br>\n Language Percent of<br>\n population Number of<br>\n speakers Number who<br>\n speak English<br>\n very well Number who<br>\n speak English<br>\n less than<br>\n very well<br>\n English (only) ~80% 237,810,023 N/A N/A<br>\n Spanish<br>\n (including Spanish Creole but excluding Puerto Rico) 13% 40,489,813 23,899,421 16,590,392<br>\n Chinese<br>\n (all varieties, including Mandarin and Cantonese) 1.0% 3,372,930 1,518,619 1,854,311<br>\n Tagalog<br>\n (including Filipino) 0.5% 1,701,960 1,159,211 542,749<br>\n Vietnamese 0.4% 1,509,993 634,273 875,720<br>\n Arabic<br>\n (all varieties) 0.3% 1,231,098 770,882 460,216<br>\n French<br>\n (including Patois and Cajun) 0.3% 1,216,668 965,584 251,087<br>\n Korean 0.2% 1,088,788 505,734 583,054<br>\n Religion<br>\n Main article: Religion in the United States<br>\n See also: History of religion in the United States, Freedom of religion in the United States, Separation of church and state in the United States, and List of religious movements that began in the United States<br>\n Religious affiliation in the U.S. (2014)[7]<br>\n Affiliation % of U.S. population<br>\n Christian 70.6</p>\n <p>Protestant 46.5</p>\n <p>Evangelical Protestant 25.4</p>\n <p>Mainline Protestant 14.7</p>\n <p>Black church 6.5</p>\n <p>Catholic 20.8</p>\n <p>Mormon 1.6</p>\n <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses 0.8</p>\n <p>Eastern Orthodox 0.5</p>\n <p>Other Christian 0.4</p>\n <p>Jewish 1.9</p>\n <p>Muslim 0.9</p>\n <p>Buddhist 0.7</p>\n <p>Hindu 0.7</p>\n <p>Other faiths 1.8</p>\n <p>Irreligious 22.8</p>\n <p>Nothing in particular 15.8</p>\n <p>Agnostic 4.0</p>\n <p>Atheist 3.1</p>\n <p>Don’t know or refused answer 0.6</p>\n <p>The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.</p>\n <p>Christianity is by far the most common religion practiced in the U.S., but other religions are followed, too. In a 2013 survey, 56% of Americans said that religion played a “very important role in their lives”, a far higher figure than that of any other wealthy nation.[308] In a 2009 Gallup poll, 42% of Americans said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly; the figures ranged from a low of 23% in Vermont to a high of 63% in Mississippi.[309] Experts, researchers and authors have referred to the United States as a “Protestant nation” or “founded on Protestant principles,”[310][311][312][313] specifically emphasizing its Calvinist heritage.[314][315][316]</p>\n <p>As with other Western countries, the U.S. is becoming less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30.[317] Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion has been declining since the mid to late 1980s,[318] and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious.[7][319] According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time.[320][321] Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.[322]</p>\n <p>According to a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults identified themselves as Christian,[323] Protestant denominations accounted for 46.5%, while Roman Catholicism, at 20.8%, was the largest individual denomination.[324] The total reporting non-Christian religions in 2014 was 5.9%.[324] Other religions include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%), Buddhism (0.7%), Hinduism (0.7%).[324] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion, up from 8.2% in 1990.[324][325][326] There are also Unitarian Universalist, Baha’i, Sikh, Jain, Shinto, Confucian, Taoist, Druid, Native American, Wiccan, humanist and deist communities.[327]</p>\n <p>Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism, and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination. Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin primarily in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas and, in part, in the English Catholic Proprietary of Maryland,[328] It later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island has the highest percentage of Catholics with 40 percent of the total population.[329] Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe and Germany. North and South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Presbyterianism was introduced in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants. Although it has spread across the United States, it is heavily concentrated on the East Coast. Dutch Reformed congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam (New York City) before spreading westward. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.[330]</p>\n <p>The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative Evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation’s average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.[309]</p>\n <p>Family structure<br>\n Main article: Family structure in the United States<br>\n As of 2007, 58% of Americans age 18 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 25% had never been married.[331] Women now work mostly outside the home and receive a majority of bachelor’s degrees.[332]</p>\n <p>The U.S. teenage pregnancy rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991.[333] In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, and the lowest in Wyoming.[333][334] Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain higher than those of most Western nations.[335] In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.[336]</p>\n <p>The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births per woman.[337] Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries).[338] In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.[339] Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide and it is legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.[340]</p>\n <p>Government and politics</p>\n <p>Main articles: Federal government of the United States, State governments of the United States, Local government in the United States, and Elections in the United States</p>\n <p>The United States Capitol,<br>\n where Congress meets:<br>\n the Senate, left; the House, right</p>\n <p>The White House, home and workplace of the U.S. President</p>\n <p>Supreme Court Building, where the nation’s highest court sits<br>\n The United States is the world’s oldest surviving federation. It is a representative democracy, “in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law”.[341] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country’s supreme legal document.[342] For 2016, the U.S. ranked 21st on the Democracy Index[343] (tied with Italy) and 18th on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[344]</p>\n <p>In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government’s duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is rare at lower levels.[345]</p>\n <p>The federal government is composed of three branches:</p>\n <p>Legislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[346] and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[347]<br>\n Executive: The President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to Congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.[348]<br>\n Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the President with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[349]<br>\n The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population every tenth year. At the 2010 census, seven states had the minimum of one representative, while California, the most populous state, had 53.[350]</p>\n <p>The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[351] The Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[352]</p>\n <p>The state governments are structured in roughly similar fashion; Nebraska uniquely has a unicameral legislature.[353] The governor (chief executive) of each state is directly elected. Some state judges and cabinet officers are appointed by the governors of the respective states, while others are elected by popular vote.</p>\n <p>The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the “great writ” of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[354] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans’ individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[355] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[356]</p>\n <p>Political divisions<br>\n Main articles: Political divisions of the United States, U.S. state, Territories of the United States, List of states and territories of the United States, and Indian reservation<br>\n Further information: Territorial evolution of the United States and United States territorial acquisitions</p>\n <p>Map of U.S. Economic Exclusion Zone,[357] highlighting states, territories and possessions<br>\n The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and eleven uninhabited island possessions.[358] The states and territories are the principal administrative districts in the country. These are divided into subdivisions of counties and independent cities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, Washington DC.[359] The states and the District of Columbia choose the President of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their Representatives and Senators in Congress; the District of Columbia has three.[360]</p>\n <p>Congressional Districts are reapportioned among the states following each decennial Census of Population. Each state then draws single member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The total number of Representatives is 435, and delegate Members of Congress represent the District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories.[361]</p>\n <p>The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states’ sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they have a great deal of autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.[362]</p>\n <p>Parties and elections<br>\n Main articles: Politics of the United States and Political ideologies in the United States</p>\n <p>Congressional leadership meeting with then-President Obama in 2011.[363]</p>\n <p>Donald Trump<br>\n 45th President<br>\n since January 20, 2017</p>\n <p>Mike Pence<br>\n 48th Vice President<br>\n since January 20, 2017<br>\n The United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its history.[364] For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate–former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912–has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.[365]</p>\n <p>Within American political culture, the center-right Republican Party is considered “conservative” and the center-left Democratic Party is considered “liberal”.[366][367] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as “blue states”, are relatively liberal. The “red states” of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative.</p>\n <p>Republican Donald Trump, the winner of the 2016 presidential election, is currently serving as the 45th President of the United States.[368] Current leadership in the Senate includes Republican Vice President Mike Pence, Republican President Pro Tempore Orrin Hatch, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.[369] Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.[370]</p>\n <p>In the 115th United States Congress, both the House of Representatives and the Senate are controlled by the Republican Party. The Senate currently consists of 52 Republicans, and 46 Democrats with 2 Independents who caucus with the Democrats; the House consists of 241 Republicans and 194 Democrats.[371] In state governorships, there are 33 Republicans, 16 Democrats, and 1 Independent.[372] Among the DC mayor and the 5 territorial governors, there are 2 Republicans, 1 Democrat, 1 New Progressive, and 2 Independents.[373]</p>\n <p>Foreign relations<br>\n Main articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States</p>\n <p>The United Nations Headquarters was built in Midtown Manhattan in 1952.[374]<br>\n The United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters. It is a member of the G7,[375] G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military equipment).[376]</p>\n <p>The United States has a “Special Relationship” with the United Kingdom[377] and strong ties with Canada,[378] Australia,[379] New Zealand,[380] the Philippines,[381] Japan,[382] South Korea,[383] Israel,[384] and several European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, and Spain. It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In 2008, the United States spent a net $25.4 billion on official development assistance, the most in the world. As a share of America’s large gross national income (GNI), however, the U.S. contribution of 0.18% ranked last among 22 donor states. By contrast, private overseas giving by Americans is relatively generous.[385]</p>\n <p>The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for three sovereign nations through Compact of Free Association with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau. These are Pacific island nations, once part of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands after World War II, which gained independence in subsequent years.[386]</p>\n <p>On October 25, 2017, Vice President Mike Pence announced at a In Defense of Christians annual dinner meeting in Washington that the United States would stop funding United Nations relief efforts, cases tackling the persecution of Christians in the Middle East, but insisted that the U.S. would instead help and aid Christians directly through the U.S. Agency for International Development.[387] Pence said that he will be visiting the Middle East in December and will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss peace agreements.[388][389]</p>\n <p>Government finance<br>\n See also: Taxation in the United States and United States federal budget</p>\n <p>US federal debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, from 1790 to 2013.[390]<br>\n Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state, and local government levels. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[391] During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($242B or 10%).[392] Based on CBO estimates,[393] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.[394]</p>\n <p>U.S. taxation is generally progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and is among the most progressive in the developed world.[395][396][397][398][399] The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes,[400] and about half of all taxes.[401] Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains.[402][403] The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers.[404][405] However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.[406]</p>\n <p>The top 10% paid 51.8% of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax national income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes.[407] In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile.[408][409] The incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades.[398][410] State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.[398][411]</p>\n <p>During FY 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down $60 billion or 1.7% vs. FY 2011 spending of $3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included: Medicare &amp; Medicaid ($802B or 23% of spending), Social Security ($768B or 22%), Defense Department ($670B or 19%), non-defense discretionary ($615B or 17%), other mandatory ($461B or 13%) and interest ($223B or 6%).[392]</p>\n <p>The total national debt of the United States in the United States was $18.527 trillion (106% of the GDP) in 2014.[412][fn 14]</p>\n <p>Military<br>\n Main article: United States Armed Forces</p>\n <p>The carrier strike groups of the Kitty Hawk, Ronald Reagan, and Abraham Lincoln with aircraft from the Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force.<br>\n The President holds the title of commander-in-chief of the nation’s armed forces and appoints its leaders, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[417]</p>\n <p>Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.[418] American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force’s large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy’s 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy’s Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad,[419] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[420]</p>\n <p>The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than $700 billion, 41% of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[421] U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA.[422] Defense’s share of U.S. spending has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal outlays in 2011.[423]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>US global military presence.<br>\n The proposed base Department of Defense budget for 2012, $553 billion, was a 4.2% increase over 2011; an additional $118 billion was proposed for the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.[424] The last American troops serving in Iraq departed in December 2011;[425] 4,484 service members were killed during the Iraq War.[426] Approximately 90,000 U.S. troops were serving in Afghanistan in April 2012;[427] by November 8, 2013 2,285 had been killed during the War in Afghanistan.[428]</p>\n <p>Law enforcement and crime</p>\n <p>Main articles: Law enforcement in the United States and Crime in the United States<br>\n See also: Law of the United States, Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, Human rights in the United States § Justice system, Incarceration in the United States, and Capital punishment in the United States</p>\n <p>Law enforcement in the U.S. is maintained primarily by local police departments.[429]<br>\n Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police and sheriff’s departments, with state police providing broader services. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is the largest in the country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts’ rulings and federal laws.[430] At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.[431]</p>\n <p>In 2015, there were 15,696 murders which was 1,532 more than in 2014, a 10.8 per cent increase, the largest since 1971.[432] The murder rate in 2015 was 4.9 per 100,000 people.[433] In 2016 the murder rate increased by 8.6%, with 17,250 murders that year.[434] The national clearance rate for homicides in 2015 was 64.1%, compared to 90% in 1965.[435] In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54% decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980.[436] In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other developed nations.[437] A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States “homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.”[438] Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject of contentious political debate.</p>\n <p>From 1980 through 2008 males represented 77% of homicide victims and 90% of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5% of all homicides during that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites (“whites” includes most Hispanics), and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were intraracial, with 93% of black victims killed by blacks and 84% of white victims killed by whites.[439] In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest.[440] The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes.[441]</p>\n <p>Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and used in 31 states.[442][443] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma.[444] Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.[445]</p>\n <p>The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and total prison population in the world.[446] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults.[447] In December 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision in December 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997.[448] The prison population has quadrupled since 1980,[449] and state and local spending on prisons and jails has grown three times as much as that spent on public education during the same period.[450] However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013[451] and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012.[452] The country’s high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies.[453] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[454] The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been a subject of debate.[455][456] In 2008, Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate,[457] and Maine the lowest.[458]</p>\n <p>Economy</p>\n <p>Main article: Economy of the United States<br>\n See also: Economic history of the United States<br>\n Economic indicators<br>\n Nominal GDP $18.45 trillion (Q2 2016) [459]<br>\n Real GDP growth 1.4% (Q2 2016) [459]<br>\n 2.6% (2015) [460]<br>\n CPI inflation 1.1% (August 2016) [461]<br>\n Employment-to-population ratio 59.7% (August 2016) [462]<br>\n Unemployment 4.9% (August 2016) [463]<br>\n Labor force participation rate 62.8% (August 2016) [464]<br>\n Total public debt $19.808 trillion (October 25, 2016) [465]<br>\n Household net worth $89.063 trillion (Q2 2016) [466]</p>\n <p>United States export treemap (2011): The U.S. is the world’s second-largest exporter.<br>\n The United States has a capitalist mixed economy[467] which is fueled by abundant natural resources and high productivity.[468] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $16.8 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP).[469]</p>\n <p>The nominal GDP of the U.S. is estimated to be $17.528 trillion as of 2014[470] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[471] The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita (first in the Americas)[33][32] and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP.[469] The U.S. dollar is the world’s primary reserve currency.[472] The U.S. economy is also the fastest growing in the Americas.[33][32]</p>\n <p>The United States is the largest importer of goods and second-largest exporter, though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.[473] Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.[474] In 2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the country’s largest export.[473] Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt.[475] The largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve, who hold the majority of the debt.[476][477][478][479][fn 15]</p>\n <p>In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3% and state and local government activity (including federal transfers) the remaining 9.3%.[482] The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1.[483] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8% of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power.[484] The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade; by net income it is manufacturing.[485] In the franchising business model, McDonald’s and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the world.[486]</p>\n <p>Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field.[487] The United States is the largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its second-largest importer.[488] It is the world’s number one producer of electrical and nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas, sulfur, phosphates, and salt. The National Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium, copper, lead, magnesium, zinc, titanium and others.[489][490]</p>\n <p>Agriculture accounts for just under 1% of GDP,[484] yet the United States is the world’s top producer of corn[491] and soybeans.[492] The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food, representing half of the world’s biotech crops.[493]</p>\n <p>Consumer spending comprises 68% of the U.S. economy in 2015.[494] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12% of workers are unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe.[495] The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers.[496] The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to.[497]</p>\n <p>The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation[498] and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia.[499] While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations.[500] 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits.[500] In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.[501]</p>\n <p>The 2008–2012 global recession significantly affected the United States, with output still below potential according to the Congressional Budget Office.[502] It brought high unemployment (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising petroleum and food prices.</p>\n <p>Income, poverty and wealth</p>\n <p>A tract housing development in San Jose, California<br>\n Further information: Income in the United States, Poverty in the United States, Affluence in the United States, United States counties by per capita income, and Income inequality in the United States<br>\n Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD nations, and in 2007 had the second-highest median household income.[503][504][505] According to the Census Bureau, median household income was $59,039 in 2016. [506] Accounting for 4.4% of the global population, Americans collectively possess 41.6% of the world’s total wealth,[507] and Americans make up roughly half of the world’s population of millionaires.[508] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[509] Americans on average have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and more than every EU nation.[510] For 2013 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 5th among 187 countries in its Human Development Index and 28th in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[511]</p>\n <p>After years of stagnant growth, in 2016, according to the Census, median household income reached a record high after two consecutive years of record growth, although income inequality remains at record highs with top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income.[512] There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[513] However, the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance.[514] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected income inequality,[515] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[516] The top 1 percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers,[517] The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.[518][disputed ][519]</p>\n <p>United States’ families median net worth<br>\n source: Fed Survey of Consumer Finances[520]<br>\n in 2013 dollars 1998 2013 change<br>\n All families $102,500 $81,200 -20.8%<br>\n Bottom 20% of incomes $8,300 $6,100 -26.5%<br>\n 2nd lowest 20% of incomes $47,400 $22,400 -52.7%<br>\n Middle 20% of incomes $76,300 $61,700 -19.1%<br>\n Top 10% $646,600 $1,130,700 +74.9%<br>\n Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country’s household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2%.[521] According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country’s wealth in 2016.[522] Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[523] Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down $14 trillion, but has since increased $14 trillion over 2006 levels.[524][525] At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to $11.8 trillion,[526] down from $13.8 trillion at the end of 2008.[527]</p>\n <p>There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[528] In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1% of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic.[529] According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty today, up from one in seven in 1980.[530]</p>\n <p>Infrastructure</p>\n <p>Transportation<br>\n Main article: Transportation in the United States</p>\n <p>The Interstate Highway System, which extends 46,876 miles (75,440 km).[531]<br>\n Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million km) of public roads,[532] including one of the world’s longest highway systems at 57,000 miles (91700 km).[533] The world’s second-largest automobile market,[534] the United States has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans.[535] About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.[536] The average American adult (accounting for all drivers and non-drivers) spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling 29 miles (47 km).[537]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Map showing current rail speeds in the United States.[538]<br>\n Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips.[539][540] Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, partly because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior.[541][542] However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010.[543] Also, light rail development has increased in recent years.[544] Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.[545]</p>\n <p>The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[546] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[547] Of the world’s 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and the fourth-busiest, O’Hare International Airport in Chicago.[548] In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks of 2001, the Transportation Security Administration was created to police airports and commercial airliners.</p>\n <p>Energy<br>\n Further information: Energy policy of the United States</p>\n <p>The U.S. power transmission grid consists of about 300,000 km (190,000 mi) of lines operated by approximately 500 companies.

In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources.[550] The United States is the world’s largest consumer of petroleum.[551]The United States has 27% of global coal reserves.[552] It is the world’s largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.[553]</p>\n <p>For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception in the wake of a 1979 accident.

Universal government-funded education exists in the United States, while there are also many privately funded institutions.<br>\n American public education is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[559]</p>\n <p>About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[560] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending more than $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more than $12,000 per high school student.[561] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[562]</p>\n <p>The United States has many competitive private and public institutions of higher education. The majority of the world’s top universities listed by different ranking organizations are in the U.S.[563][564][565] There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor’s degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[566] The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.[225][567] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[568]</p>\n <p>As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[561][569] As of 2012, student loan debt exceeded one trillion dollars, more than Americans owe on credit cards.[570]</p>\n <p>Culture</p>\n <p>Main article: Culture of the United States<br>\n See also: Alaska Natives § Cultures, Native American cultures in the United States, Culture of the Native Hawaiians, Social class in the United States, Public holidays in the United States, and Tourism in the United States<br>\n The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[571][572] Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries.[573] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[571][574] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[571]</p>\n <p>Core American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism,[575] as well as a unifying belief in an “American creed” emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[576] Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73%, and around twelve times the French figure of 0.14%.[577][578]</p>\n <p>The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[579] Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate.[580][581][582][583][471][584] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[585] scholars identify significant differences between the country’s social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[586] Americans’ self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree.[587] While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.[588]</p>\n <p>Food<br>\n Main article: Cuisine of the United States</p>\n <p>Apple pie is a food commonly associated with American cuisine.<br>\n Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour[589] and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers.[590] These home grown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America’s most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[591]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Roasted turkey is a traditional menu item of an American Thanksgiving dinner.[592]<br>\n Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[593] Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea.[594] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[595][596]</p>\n <p>American eating habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary roots with some variations. Although American lands could grow newer vegetables that Britain could not, most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by Europeans.[597] Over time American foods changed to a point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in 1972: “Our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence”.[598]</p>\n <p>The American fast food industry, the world’s largest,[599] pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s.[600] Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans’ caloric intake rose 24%;[593] frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American “obesity epidemic”.[601] Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake.[602]</p>\n <p>Literature, philosophy, and the arts<br>\n Main articles: American literature, American philosophy, Architecture of the United States, Visual art of the United States, and American classical music</p>\n <p>Mark Twain, American author and humorist.<br>\n In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century’s second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[603] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character–such as Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)–may be dubbed the “Great American Novel”.[604]</p>\n <p>Twelve U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Bob Dylan in 2016. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[605] Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[606]</p>\n <p>The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, and Thomas Sowell have affected various fields in social and political philosophy.[607][608]</p>\n <p>In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[609] Georgia O’Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[610] Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.[611]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Times Square in New York City, the hub of the Broadway theater district[612]<br>\n One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum, who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway; the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards. Playwright Eugene O’Neill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936; other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and August Wilson.[613]</p>\n <p>Though little known at the time, Charles Ives’s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music.</p>\n <p>Choreographers Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham helped create modern dance, while George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins were leaders in 20th-century ballet.</p>\n <p>Music<br>\n Main article: Music of the United States</p>\n <p>The Grammy Award is awarded to leading music artists.<br>\n The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[614]</p>\n <p>Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America’s most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities,[614] as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay-Z, Eminem and Kanye West.[615] Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[616][617][618]</p>\n <p>Cinema<br>\n Main article: Cinema of the United States</p>\n <p>The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California<br>\n Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[619] The world’s first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison’s Kinetoscope.[620] The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film’s development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[621]</p>\n <p>Director D. W. Griffith, the top American filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[622] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West and history, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting, with great influence on subsequent directors. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the “Golden Age of Hollywood”, from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[623] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[624][625] In the 1970s, film directors such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were a vital component in what became known as “New Hollywood” or the “Hollywood Renaissance”,[626] grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[627] Since, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs, and in return, high earnings at the box office, with Cameron’s Avatar (2009) earning more than $2 billion.[628]</p>\n <p>Notable films topping the American Film Institute’s AFI 100 list include Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time,[629][630] Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler’s List (1993), Singin’ in the Rain (1952), It’s a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).[631] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[632] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[633]</p>\n <p>Sports<br>\n Main article: Sports in the United States</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Most popular American sports are American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey[634]<br>\n American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport;[635] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally. Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country’s next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at different, but overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences.[636] In soccer, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men’s national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women’s team has won the FIFA Women’s World Cup three times; Major League Soccer is the sport’s highest league in the United States (featuring 19 American and 3 Canadian teams). The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[637]</p>\n <p>Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. As of 2014, the United States has won 2,400 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 281 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.[638] While most major U.S. sports have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[639] The most watched individual sports are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR.[640][641] Rugby union is considered the fastest growing sport in the U.S., with registered players numbered at 115,000+ and a further 1.2 million participants.[642]</p>\n <p>Media<br>\n Main article: Media of the United States</p>\n <p>The corporate headquarters of the American Broadcasting Company in New York City<br>\n The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox. The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[643] Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[644]</p>\n <p>In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was also created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other.) As of September 30, 2014, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[645]</p>\n <p>Well-known newspapers include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and USA Today.[646] Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have “alternative weeklies” to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City’s The Village Voice or Los Angeles’ LA Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.[647] Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon, and Twitter.[648]</p>\n <p>More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[649][650]</p>\n <p>Science and technology</p>\n <p>Main articles: Science and technology in the United States and Science policy of the United States</p>\n <p>Astronaut James Irwin walking on the Moon next to Apollo 15’s landing module and lunar rover in 1971. The effort to reach the Moon was triggered by the Space Race.<br>\n The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.[651]</p>\n <p>In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison’s research laboratory, one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[652] The latter lead to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[653]</p>\n <p>The rise of Fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[654] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and aeronautics.[655][656]</p>\n <p>The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[657][658][659] This in turn led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.[660]</p>\n <p>These advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for individual use.[661] As of 2013, 83.8% of American households owned at least one computer, and 73.3% had high-speed Internet service.[662] 91% of Americans also own a mobile phone as of May 2013.[663] The United States ranks highly with regard to freedom of use of the internet.[664]</p>\n <p>In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector.[665] The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.[666]</p>\n <p>Health</p>\n <p>See also: Health care in the United States, Health care reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States</p>\n <p>New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City is one of the world’s busiest hospitals. Pictured is the Weill Cornell facility (white complex at center).<br>\n The United States has a life expectancy of 79.8 years at birth, up from 75.2 years in 1990.[667][668][669] The infant mortality rate of 6.17 per thousand places the United States 56th-lowest out of 224 countries.[670]</p>\n <p>Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere contributed to lowering the country’s rank in life expectancy from 11th in the world in 1987, to 42nd in 2007.[671] Obesity rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years, are the highest in the industrialized world, and are among the highest anywhere.[672][673] Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight.[674] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.[675]</p>\n <p>In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer’s disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[669] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[676]</p>\n <p>The U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the European Union and Switzerland together contributed to five.[677] Since 1966, more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.[678] The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP.[679]</p>\n <p>Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance.[680] The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[681][682] In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance.[683] Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.[684][685]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Special Thanks to :</p>\n <p>1.

He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi traveled around India for two years, and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.</p>\n <p>Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to Keshubhai Patel’s failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[a] or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, although a court found no evidence to prosecute Modi.[b] His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise.[8] His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state.[c]</p>\n <p>Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election, which gave the party a majority in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984. Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modi’s administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased spending on infrastructure, and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power through the abolition of the planning commission. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.[d]</p>\n <p>Contents<br>\n Early life and education</p>\n <p>Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.1915 – 1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c.1920).[17] Modi’s family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community,[18][19][20] which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government.[21][22]</p>\n <p>As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus.[23][24] Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with an interest in theatre.[25] Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and this was noted by his teachers and students.[26] Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[27][28]</p>\n <p>When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) for RSS and became his political mentor.[29] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP’s Gujarat unit in 1980.[30] Engaged while still a child to Jashodaben, a girl from a family who lived close by, Modi rejected the arranged marriage at the same time he graduated from high school.[31] The resulting familial tensions contributed to his decision to leave home in 1967.[32]</p>\n <p>Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged.[33] In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education.[34][35][36] Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi’s life.[37]</p>\n <p>In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati.[38] Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968–69.[39] Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad.[40] There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter’s canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[41][42]</p>\n <p>In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city.[43][44][45] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS,[42] working under Inamdar.[46] Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him.[46] Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001.[47]</p>\n <p>In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning[48] at University of Delhi,[49][50] graduating with a third class.[51] Five years later, in 1982, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University,[52][53] as an external distance learning student.[54]</p>\n <p>Early political career</p>\n <p>In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as “The Emergency”, many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[55][56] Modi was appointed general secretary of the “Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti”, an RSS committee coordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[57] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[58][59] Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[60] During this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the Emergency.[61][62] Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several other national political figures.[63] In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a Sikh.[60]</p>\n <p>Modi became an RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS’s version of the history of the Emergency.[64] He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985.[30] In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP’s campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi’s planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers.[65] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi’s work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP’s Gujarat unit later in 1987.[66]</p>\n <p>Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP’s National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise L. K. Advani’s 1990 Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi’s 1991–92 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity).[25][67][68] However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with Shankersingh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision.[68] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi’s electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly elections.[68][30][69][70] In November of that year Modi was elected BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[69][71] The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections.[25] Modi, on the selection committee for the 1998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections,[69][72] and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.[73]</p>\n <p>Chief Minister of Gujarat</p>\n <p>Taking office<br>\n In 2001, Keshubhai Patel’s health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel’s standing had been damaged by his administration’s handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[69][74][75] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel’s administration, was chosen as a replacement.[25] Although BJP leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi’s lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel’s deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was “going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all”. On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections.[76] On 7 October 2001, Modi was administered the oath of office.[77] On 24 February 2002 he entered the Gujarat state legislature by winning a by-election to the Rajkot – II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC by 14,728 votes, which enabled him to take office.[78]</p>\n <p>2002 Gujarat riots<br>\n Main article: 2002 Gujarat riots<br>\n On 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[e] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[81][82] In making a public statement after the incident, Modi said that the attack had been terror attack planned by local Muslims.[3][81][83] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a bandh across the state.[84][85] Riots began during the bandh, and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[81][84][85] The government’s decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[81][86] The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed.[87] Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000.[81][88] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[89] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women.[2]</p>\n <p>The government of Gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots,[1][2][3] and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation.[90] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism.[91][92][93] Summarising academic views on the subject, Martha Nussbaum said: “There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law.”[2] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating.[84][85] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time.[3] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[94] Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[95] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[2][83][96] In 2012 Maya Kodnani, a minister in Modi’s government from 2007 to 2009, was convicted of participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 riots.[97][98] Although Modi’s government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for Kodnani on appeal, it reversed its decision in 2013.[99][100]</p>\n <p>Modi’s personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, Modi said that “What is happening is a chain of action and reaction.”[2] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[101] Modi has not offered an apology for the riots.[11] In March 2008, the Supreme Court reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[90][102][103] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri (widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre), in April 2009 the court also asked the SIT to investigate the issue of Modi’s complicity in the killings.[102] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[102][104] In July 2011, the court-appointed amicus curiae Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT’s position, he said that Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[105][106] The Supreme Court gave the matter to the magistrate’s court. The SIT examined Ramachandran’s report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jaffri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013 the magistrate’s court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT’s finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister.[107]</p>\n <p>2002 election<br>\n In the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[108] Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted.[109] His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. Bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved.[110][111] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[112] In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[113] Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[114][115][116][117] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters.[112] Modi hired the public relations firm APCO Worldwide to manage his image.[112] He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 1,13,589 of 1,54,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes.[118] On 22 December 2002, Bhandari swore Modi in for a second term.[119] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly.[1][114]</p>\n <p>Second term<br>\n During Modi’s second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat’s economic development.[74][1][114] Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP),[120] entrenched in the state after the decline of Ahmedabad’s textile industry,[74] and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers’ demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[120][121] Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi’s administrative decisions.[120] Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a forward to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[122][123]</p>\n <p>Modi’s relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister)[124][125] distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP’s electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[126][127]</p>\n <p>Questions about Modi’s relationship with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations during his tenure as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed under the aegis of the International Religious Freedom Act,[128][129] the only person denied a US visa under this law.[130] The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[131] and the EU[132] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.[133][134]</p>\n <p>During the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[135] In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ” for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation” such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 Mumbai train bombings.[136] In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a “spiritual experience” for Dalits.[137][138][139] However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct.[140] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat’s 1,600-kilometre (990 mi)-long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats.[141] In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post,[142] and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year’s election.[143]</p>\n <p>Development projects</p>\n <p>The Sardar Sarovar Dam during a 2006 height increase.<br>\n As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion were signed.[74]</p>\n <p>The governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[144] Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[145] As a result, the state’s production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India.[144] The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[146] led to Gujarat’s agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.[147] Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4–6% of the area intended.[144] Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent – the highest of any state.[146] However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992–97 INC government was 12.9 percent.[148] In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata’s to Gujarat.[149]</p>\n <p>The Modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed.[148] Modi significantly changed the state’s system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised,[144] according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[150]</p>\n <p>Development debate<br>\n Modi speaking at flower-decked podium<br>\n Modi addressing graduates of the Gujarat National Law University in 2012.<br>\n There has been a contentious debate surrounding the development of the state of Gujarat during Modi’s tenure as chief minister.[151] The GDP growth rate of Gujarat averaged 10% during Modi’s tenure, a value above that of the country as a whole, and similar to other highly industrialised states.[149] Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office.[152] Some scholars have stated the rate of growth did not accelerate during Modi’s tenure,[152] although the state is considered to have maintained a high growth rate during Modi’s Chief Ministership.[95] Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank’s “ease of doing business” rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.[153] In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for “economic freedom” by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens’ rights and labour and business regulation among the country’s 20 largest states.[149][154] In the later years of Modi’s government, Gujarat’s economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.[1] Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land. Modi’s policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened.[114]</p>\n <p>Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi’s tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the “alarming” category on the India State Hunger Index.[155][156] A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in children.[157]</p>\n <p>Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.[95] It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.[95] With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most Indian states.[95] The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.[95] Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index. Political Scientist Christophe Jaffrelot says that under Modi the number of families below the poverty line has increased and conditions for rural adivasi and dalits, in particular, have declined.[5] Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare.[95] In July 2013, economics Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen expressed disapproval of Modi’s governance record, saying that under his administration Gujarat’s “record in education and healthcare is pretty bad”.[158] However, economists Arvind Panagariya and Jagdish Bhagwati say that Gujarat’s social indicators have improved from a lower baseline than that of other Indian states. According to them, Gujarat’s performance in raising literacy rates has been superior to other states and the “rapid” improvement of health indicators is evidence that “its progress has not been poor by any means.”[159]</p>\n <p>Final years<br>\n Modi talking to a woman; both are seated.<br>\n Modi with Anandiben Patel at a meeting of BJP MLAs after his election as prime minister; Patel succeeded him as Gujarat chief minister.<br>\n Further information: Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, 2012<br>\n During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[114]</p>\n <p>Despite the BJP’s shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi’s election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.[114] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[114] His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012.[114] He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji (“Guru worthy of worship”).[160] According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers and to reassure RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.[161]</p>\n <p>While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people,[112] something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of Sanjiv Bhatt.[162] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure[163] and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995).[164] In later by-elections the BJP won four more assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats held by the INC, although Modi did not campaign for its candidates.[165] In 2013, the Wharton India Economic Forum (WIEF) at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by Modi following protests by Indian-Americans.[166] After his election as prime minister, Modi resigned as the chief minister and as an MLA from Maninagar on 21 May 2014. Anandiben Patel succeeded him as the chief minister.[167]</p>\n <p>2014 Indian general election</p>\n <p>Main article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for Indian general election, 2014<br>\n In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP’s candidate for prime minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[168][169] Several BJP leaders expressed opposition to Modi’s candidature,[170] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani, who cited concern with leaders who were “concerned with their personal agendas”.[171] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP’s election campaign.[172][173] Several people who voted for the BJP stated that if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party.[174][168][174][175] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.[170][176] The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.[151]</p>\n <p>During the campaign, Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat.[151][170] Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about “development,” without focus on any specific policies.[170] His message found support among young Indians and among middle-class citizens.[151] The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi’s commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism.[151] Prior to the election Modi’s image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modi’s neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development.[173] Although the BJP avoided issues of Hindu nationalism to an extent, Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign.[170][174][12] The BJP’s campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.[156] Modi’s campaign blitz cost approximately ₹50 billion (US$780 million),[151] and received extensive financial support from corporate donors.[156] In addition to more conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media,[151][170] and addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearances.[12]</p>\n <p>The BJP won 31% of the vote,[11] and more than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984.[173][174] Voter dissatisfaction with the INC, as well as with regional parties in North India, was another reason for the success of the BJP,[174] as was the support from the RSS.[170] In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before. It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims.[174] The magnitude of the BJP’s victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing.[151][174][177][178] Modi’s tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.[179]</p>\n <p>Modi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies: Varanasi and Vadodara.[180] He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi and Madhusudan Mistry of the INC in Vadodara by 570,128 votes.[181] Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, was appointed prime minister by India’s president.[182][183] To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat.[184]</p>\n <p>Prime Minister</p>\n <p>Main article: Premiership of Narendra Modi<br>\n For a chronological guide to this subject, see Timeline of the premiership of Narendra Modi.<br>\n Wikinews has related news: Narendra Modi elected new Prime Minister of India.<br>\n Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. He became the first Prime Minister born after India’s independence from the British Empire.[185] His first cabinet consisted of 45 ministers, 25 fewer than the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government.[186] 21 new ministers were added to the council of ministers in November 2014.[187]</p>\n <p>Economic policies</p>\n <p>Modi with other BRICS leaders in 2016. Left to right: Temer, Modi, Xi, Putin and Zuma.<br>\n The economic policies of Modi’s government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, based on a neoliberal framework.[187][188] Modi liberalised India’s foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways.[187][189][190] Other reforms included removing many of the country’s labour laws, to make it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them. These reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country’s largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP.[188] The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt labourers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them.[187] In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1 percent to 3 percent over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks.[187] Over Modi’s first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5 percent, making it the world’s fastest-growing large economy.[188]</p>\n <p>The funds dedicated to poverty reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly decreased by the Modi administration.[123] The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6% of GDP during the Congress government to 12.6% during Modi’s first year in office.[187] Spending on health and family welfare declined by 15%, and on primary and secondary education by 16%.[187] The budgetary allocation for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, or the “education for all” programme, declined by 22%.[187] The government also lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, and reduced customs duties on gold, jewelry, and increased sales taxes.[187] In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices,[191] and later increased taxes on diesel and petrol.[187]</p>\n <p>Modi at the launch of the Make in India programme.<br>\n In September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.[187][192] Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market.[187] In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it.[193] Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived.[194] The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse.[194] Modi’s government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.[195]</p>\n <p>On 25 June 2015, Modi launched a programme intended to develop 100 smart cities.[196] The “Smart Cities” programme is expected to bring Information Technology companies an extra benefit of ₹20 billion (US$310 million).[197] In June 2015, Modi launched the “Housing for All By 2022” project, which intends to eliminate slums in India by building about 20 million affordable homes for India’s urban poor.[198]</p>\n <p>In his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money.[199] On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism.[200] The move led to widespread protests throughout the country, including one by opposition parties, which stalled the winter session of parliament.[201] In the days following the demonetisation, banks across the country faced severe cash shortages,[202][203][204] which had detrimental effects on a number of small businesses, on agriculture, and on transportation. People seeking to exchange their notes had lengthy waits, and several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash.[205][206] Following Modi’s announcement, the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 declined steeply.[207][clarification needed] There has been a steep increase in digital payments and transactions in the country since the day demonetization was announced.[208] Post the demonetisation, the quantum of income tax returns filed for individuals jumped by 25% indicating the widened tax net. Further, the advance tax collections rose by 42% and Self assessment tax collections rose by 34.25%.[209]</p>\n <p>Health and sanitation policies<br>\n See also: Swachh Bharat Abhiyan<br>\n In his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the amount of money spent by the government on healthcare.[157] The Modi government launched a “New Health Policy” in January 2015, although this did not increase the government’s spending on healthcare, instead emphasizing the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including reducing child and maternal mortality rates.[210] The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices received nearly 25% less funds in 2015 than in the previous year. 15 national health programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged with the National Health Mission, and received less funds than in previous years. Modi initially appointed Harsh Vardhan, a doctor and an advocate of tobacco control, as minister of health. However, Vardhan was removed in November 2015.[210] The government introduced stricter packaging laws for tobacco which requires 85% of the packet size to be covered by pictorial warnings.[211] In its budget for the second year after it took office, the Modi government reduced healthcare spending by 15%.[210] Modi has generally emphasised his government’s efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health. An article in the medical journal Lancet stated that the country “might have taken a few steps back in public health” under Modi.[210]</p>\n <p>On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (“Clean India”) campaign. The stated goals of the campaign included eliminating open defecation and manual scavenging.[212][213] The plan was to achieve these aims in five years.[213] As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them.[214][215][216] The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants.[217] The administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them.[213][214][215]</p>\n <p>Hindutva and education policy<br>\n During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders known to have opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Ram Manohar Lohia.[123] The campaign also saw the use of rhetoric based on Hindutva, however, by BJP leaders in certain states.[218] Communal tensions were played upon especially in Uttar Pradesh and the states of Northeast India.[218] A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP’s election manifesto.[12]</p>\n <p>Several state governments headed by the BJP have enacted policies aligned with Hindutva after the election of Modi as prime minister. The government of Maharashtra banned the killing of cows in 2014.[218] The Modi administration has generally avoided directly supporting policies related to a Hindutva agenda.[218] There has been an increase in the activities of a number of other Hindu nationalist organisations, sometimes with the support of the government.[123][218] The incidents included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the alleged Islamic practice of “Love Jihad”, and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right wing Hindu Mahasabha.[123] The attempts at religious conversion have been described by the VHP and other organisations involved with them as attempts at “reconversion” from Islam or Christianity. There have been a number of reports of intimidation or coercion of the subjects during these attempts.[218] Officials in the government, including the Home Minister, have defended the attempts.[218] There were additional incidents of violence targeted at religious minorities by Hindu nationalists.[123] Modi refused to remove a government minister from her position after a popular outcry resulted from her referring to religious minorities as “bastards.”[123] Commentators have suggested, however, that the violence was perpetrated by radical Hindu nationalists to undercut the authority of Modi.[123]</p>\n <p>The Modi administration appointed Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).[12] In reaction to his appointment, other historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the ruling party, questioned his credentials as a historian. Several stated that the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism.[12][219][220]</p>\n <p>The government began formulating a New Education Policy, or NEP, soon after its election. As of March 2016, this policy had yet to be implemented. This was the third education policy introduced by the Indian government, following those of 1968 and 1986. The policy was described as having overtones of Hindutva. The RSS had a role in its creation, and it did not explicitly mention the goals of “socialism, secularism and democracy” that had been mentioned in the first two policies. The policy emphasised the education of minority students, as well as those of economically backward groups, in particular on improving enrolment in schools among those groups. The policy proposed bringing religious educational institutions under the Right to Education Act. There was also a debate about removing caste-based reservation in favour of reservation based on income, a move supported by the RSS, but which was criticised as being discriminatory on the basis of caste.[221]</p>\n <p>Foreign policy<br>\n Further information: Foreign policy of Narendra Modi and List of prime ministerial trips made by Narendra Modi</p>\n <p>President Trump Gives Joint Statements with Prime Minister Modi in the Rose Garden<br>\n File:President Trump Gives Joint Statements with Prime Minister Modi in the Rose Garden.webmPlay media<br>\n Prime Minister Modi and 44th President of the United States Donald Trump giving Joint Statements in the Rose Garden.<br>\n Foreign policy played a relatively small role in Modi’s election campaign, and did not feature prominently in the BJP’s election manifesto.[222] Modi invited all the other leaders of SAARC countries to his swearing in ceremony as prime minister.[223][224] He was the first Indian prime minister to do so.[225]</p>\n <p>Modi’s foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding INC government, focused on improving economic ties, security, and regional relations.[222] Modi continued Manmohan Singh’s policy of “multialignment.”[226] The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially in East Asia, with the use of slogans such as “Make in India” and “Digital India”.[226] As a part of this policy, the Modi government completed India’s application to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which is led by China and Russia. (SCO).[226] The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel.[226] Modi added five bilateral strategic partnerships to the 25 that had been agreed by his predecessors Singh and Vajpayee.[226]</p>\n <p>During the first few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of different countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits.[222] One of Modi’s first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid.[227] Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country.[224] While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.[224]</p>\n <p>In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal with Bangladesh about the India–Bangladesh enclaves, which had been initiated by the government of Manmohan Singh.[194] Modi’s administration gave renewed attention to India’s “Look East Policy”, instituted in 1991. The policy was renamed the “Act East Policy”, and involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia.[226][228] The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar, through the state of Manipur. This represented a break with India’s historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade.[228] As of July 2016, Modi had made 51 trips to 42 countries with the intent of strengthening diplomatic relations.[229][230]</p>\n <p>Defence policy</p>\n <p>10th President of Israel Reuven Rivlin and Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Gadi Eizenkot with Modi.<br>\n The BJP election manifesto had also promised to deal with illegal immigration into India in the Northeast, as well as to be more firm in its handling of insurgent groups. During the election campaign, Modi said that he would be willing to accommodate Hindu migrants who were being persecuted in Bangladesh, but those that came with “political objectives” would have to be sent back. The Modi government issued a notification allowing Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to legalise their residency in India. The government described the measure as being taken for humanitarian reasons but it drew criticism from several Assamese organisations.[231]</p>\n <p>Modi continued the previous INC administration’s policy of increasing military spending every year, announcing an increase of 11% in the military budget in 2015.[232][233] This increase was larger than the average growth under the Congress.[232]</p>\n <p>The Modi administration negotiated a peace agreement with the largest faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCM), which was announced in August 2015. The Naga insurgency in northwest India had begun in the 1950s.[231][234] The NSCM and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a peace accord had not previously been signed.[234] In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded with a series of attacks, which killed 18 people.[231] The Modi government carried out a raid across the border with Myanmar as a result, and labelled the NSCM-K a terrorist organisation.[231]</p>\n <p>Wikinews has related news: Prime Minister Narendra Modi accuses Pakistan of waging proxy war.<br>\n Modi has repeatedly stated that Pakistan was an exporter of terrorism.[235][236] On 29 September 2016, the Indian Army stated that it had conducted a surgical strike on terror launchpads in Azad Kashmir,[237] although Pakistan denied the claim, and the details of the confrontation are still in dispute.[238][239]</p>\n <p>Environmental policies</p>\n <p>Modi (right) at CoP21 Climate Conference, in Paris, announcing the founding of an International Solar Alliance (ISA). November 2015.<br>\n In naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the “Ministry of Environment and Forests” the “Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change.”[240] In the first budget of the government, the money allotted to this ministry was reduced by more than 50%.[240] The new ministry also removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection. These included no longer requiring clearance from the National Board for Wildlife for projects close to protected areas, and allowing certain projects to proceed before environmental clearance was received.[187][240] The government also tried to reconstitute the Wildlife board such that it no longer had representatives from non-governmental organisations: however, this move was prevented by the Supreme Court.[240]</p>\n <p>Modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating.[187][241] Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas.[241] In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries.[240] The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.[241]</p>\n <p>Under the UPA government that preceded Modi’s administration, field trials of Genetically Modified (GM) crops had essentially been put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods.[242] Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted.[242] The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group Greenpeace, citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze had to do with Greenpeace’s opposition to GM crops.[242]</p>\n <p>Governance and other initiatives<br>\n Modi’s first year as prime minister saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations.[123][243] Modi’s efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions.[123] Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[194] The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.[11]</p>\n <p>On 31 December 2014, Modi announced that the Planning Commission had been scrapped. It was replaced with a body called the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog.[244][245] The Planning Commission was a legacy of the Indian Independence movement, although critics said that it was slowing economic growth.[246] The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister.[187][194][244][245][246] It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their financial allocation from the union government,[245][246] and unlike the planning commission, it does not have the power to allocate funds.[245] The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.[245]</p>\n <p>The Modi government launched a crackdown against a number of civil society organisations. Several tens of thousands of organisations were investigated by the Intelligence Bureau in the first year of the administration, on the grounds that they were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure.[123] Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz.[187] Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government.[123] This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi’s style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.[123][194]</p>\n <p>Modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister, against a total of 1,301 such laws repealed by previous governments over a span of 64 years.[247][248][249] He started a monthly radio programme titled “Mann Ki Baat” on 3 October 2014.[250] Modi also launched the Digital India programme, which has the goal of ensuring that government services are available electronically, building infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boosting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promoting digital literacy.[251][252]</p>\n <p>Personal life and image</p>\n <p>Further information: Public image of Narendra Modi<br>\n In accordance with Ghanchi tradition, Modi’s marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child. He was engaged at age 13 to Jashodaben, marrying her when he was 18. They spent little time together and grew apart when Modi began two years of travel, including visits to Hindu ashrams.[25][253] Reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a ‘pracharak’ in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh.[254][49] Although Modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career, he acknowledged his wife when he filed his nomination for a parliamentary seat in the 2014 general elections.[255][256] Modi maintains a close relationship with his mother, Hiraben and often visits her on his birthday to seek her blessings.[257]</p>\n <p>A vegetarian,[258] Modi has a frugal lifestyle and is a workaholic and introvert.[259] Adept at using social media, he has been since September 2014 the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 34.6 million followers on Twitter as of September 2017), behind Barack Obama (95.6 million followers) and Donald Trump(38.8 million followers).[260][261] Modi’s 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat.[262][263] Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, as well as for a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism.[264][265][266] Modi’s personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic.[11][267]</p>\n <p>The nomination of Modi for the prime ministership drew attention to his reputation as “one of contemporary India’s most controversial and divisive politicians.”[151][268][269][270] During the 2014 election campaign the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader, who would be able to take difficult decisions.[151][170][168][174][175] Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, in a manner unusual for the BJP and RSS.[170] Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and “development”.[271] Nonetheless, his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy.[4] Modi’s hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[4][170][11][123]</p>\n <p>As prime minister, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of people rating him “very favorably” and 93% approving of his government.[272] His approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% through his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani.[273] At the end of his second year in office, an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him “very favorably.”[274][275] At the end of his third year in office, The Times of India poll showed that 77% of the respondents rated him as “very good” and “good”.[276]</p>\n <p>Awards and recognition</p>\n <p>Modi was named the Best Chief Minister in a 2007 nationwide survey by India Today.[277] In March 2012, he appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of Time Magazine, one of the few Indian politicians to have done so.[278] He was awarded Indian of the Year by CNN-IBN news network in 2014.[279] In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he was named one of Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World.[280][281][282] He was also declared winner of the Time magazine reader’s poll for Person of the Year in 2014 and as well as in 2016.[283][284] Forbes Magazine ranked him the 15th-Most-Powerful Person in the World in 2014 and the 9th-Most-Powerful Person in the World in 2015 and 2016.[285][286][287][288] In 2015, Modi was ranked the 13th-Most-Influential Person in the World by Bloomberg Markets Magazine.[289] In the same year he was named one of Time’s “30 Most Influential People on the Internet” as the second-most-followed politician on Twitter and Facebook.[290] Modi was ranked fifth on Fortune Magazine’s first annual list of the “World’s Greatest Leaders” in 2015.[291][292] In 2016, a wax statue of Modi was unveiled at Madame Tussaud Wax Museum in London.[293][294]</p>\n <p>State honours<br>\n Decoration Country Date Note Ref.<br>\n Spange des König-Abdulaziz-Ordens.png<br>\n Order of Abdulaziz al Saud Saudi Arabia 3 April 2016 Member Special Class, The highest civilian honor of Saudi Arabia [295]<br>\n Ghazi Amanullah Khan Medal (Afghanistan) – ribbon bar.png<br>\n State Order of Ghazi Amir Amanullah Khan Afghanistan 4 June 2016 The highest civilian honor of Afghanistan [296]<br>\n References</p>\n <p>External links</p>\n <p>Wikimedia Commons has media related to Narendra Modi.<br>\n Wikiquote has quotations related to: Narendra Modi<br>\n Official</p>\n <p>Official website (Prime Minister’s office)<br>\n Official website (personal)<br>\n Official page on Bharatiya Janata Party’s website<br>\n Appearances on C-SPAN<br>\n Political offices<br>\n Preceded by<br>\n Keshubhai Patel Chief Minister of Gujarat<br>\n 2001–2014 Succeeded by<br>\n Anandiben Patel<br>\n Preceded by<br>\n Manmohan Singh Prime Minister of India<br>\n 2014–present Incumbent<br>\n Lok Sabha<br>\n Preceded by<br>\n Murli Manohar Joshi Member of the Lok Sabha<br>\n for Varanasi<br>\n 2014–present Incumbent</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p> </p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>–  Aryan Yadav</p>\n <p>CEO and Founder The Aryan Yadav Foundation ®</p>\n <p>Special Thanks to :</p>\n <p>1.

As Governor of Arkansas, Clinton overhauled the state’s education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in 1992, defeating incumbent Republican opponent George H. W. Bush. At age 46, he became the third-youngest president and the first from the Baby Boomer generation.</p>\n <p>Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress for the first time in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. During the last three years of Clinton’s presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.</p>\n <p>Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office approval rating of any U.S. president since World War II, and he has continually received high ratings in public opinion polls of U.S. presidents. Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes, such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming. He has remained active in politics by campaigning for Democratic candidates, including his wife’s presidential campaigns and Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns. In 2004, Clinton published his autobiography, My Life. In 2009, Clinton was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he teamed with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund.</p>\n <p>Listen to this article (info/dl)</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>This audio file was created from a revision of the article “Bill Clinton” dated 2012-06-04, and does not reflect subsequent edits to the article. (Audio help)<br>\n More spoken articles<br>\n Contents<br>\n Early life and career</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton’s childhood home in Hope, Arkansas<br>\n Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas.[1][2] He was the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr. (1918–1946), a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley: 1923–1994).[3] His parents married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife.[4] Soon after Bill was born, Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing. She left her son in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store.[2] At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton’s grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races.[2] In 1950, Bill’s mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks.[2] The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.[5]</p>\n <p>Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather’s surname, it was not until Clinton turned fifteen[6] that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.[2] Clinton said that he remembered his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr., to the point where he intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.[2][7]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton with his saxophone at the White House in 1996. He began playing the saxophone in elementary school. At one point, Clinton considered pursuing a career in music.<br>\n In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John’s Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School, where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.[2] Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band’s saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life:</p>\n <p>Sometime in my sixteenth year, I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official. I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never be John Coltrane or Stan Getz. I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine doctor, but I knew I would never be Michael DeBakey. But I knew I could be great in public service.[2]<br>\n Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman Senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class.[8] After a vigorous defense that made use of his “budding rhetorical and political skills”, he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck that it “made him realize that someday he would study law”.[9]</p>\n <p>Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy.[2][7] The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 I Have a Dream speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.[10]</p>\n <p>College and law school years</p>\n <p>Georgetown University</p>\n <p>Clinton ran for president of the Student Council while attending the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.<br>\n With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree in 1968.</p>\n <p>In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for class president.[11] From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright.[2] While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega[12] and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Clinton was also a member of the Order of DeMolay,[13] a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.[14]</p>\n <p>Oxford<br>\n Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College in Oxford, England, where he initially read for a B.Phil. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics.[15] Clinton did not expect the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at Yale Law School, Yale University, but he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.[7][16][17]</p>\n <p>During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller’s 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.[15][18] British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, “I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn’t good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren’t enough and you had to do something about such things”.[15] He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.[19]</p>\n <p>While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being “a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace”, having “a powerful collaborator in his wife,” and for winning “general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget”.[16][20]</p>\n <p>Vietnam War opposition and draft controversy<br>\n While at Oxford, Clinton also participated in Vietnam War protests and organized an October 1969 Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event.[2]</p>\n <p>During the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.[21] He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and was aware that he might lose his draft deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.[22]</p>\n <p>He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way “to maintain my political viability within the system”.[23] Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers 1 to 310 would have to be drafted before him, making it unlikely that he would be drafted. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)[24]</p>\n <p>Colonel Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton’s ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:</p>\n <p>I was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to Senator Fulbright’s office that Bill Clinton, a Rhodes Scholar, should be admitted to the ROTC program … I believe that he purposely deceived me, using the possibility of joining the ROTC as a ploy to work with the draft board to delay his induction and get a new draft classification.[25]<br>\n During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton’s uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.[26] Although legal, Clinton’s actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright’s influence to avoid military service.[27][28] Clinton’s 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton’s letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.[29]</p>\n <p>Law school<br>\n After Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973.[2][7] In 1971, he met fellow law student Hillary Rodham in the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him.[2][30] They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California.[31] They married on October 11, 1975, and their only child, Chelsea, was born on February 27, 1980.[30]</p>\n <p>Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading George McGovern’s effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign’s local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk,[32] future governor of Texas Ann Richards,[33] and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) Steven Spielberg.[34]</p>\n <p>Early political career</p>\n <p>Further information: Electoral history of Bill Clinton<br>\n Governor of Arkansas (1979–1981, 1983–1992)<br>\n Further information: Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1978; Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1980; Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1982; Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1986; and Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1990<br>\n After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton’s campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52 percent to 48 percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election,[35] Clinton was elected.[7]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Newly elected Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton meets with President Jimmy Carter in 1978, fifteen years before assuming the nation’s highest office.<br>\n Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. At age 32, he became the youngest governor in the country. Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the “Boy Governor”.[36][37][38] He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas’s roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens’ anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31 percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose’s unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton’s defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation’s history.[7]</p>\n <p>Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey’s Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.[39] In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas’s economy and improved the state’s educational system.[40] For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.[41] He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan’s landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level.[41][42] Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan’s 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.[7]</p>\n <p>In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton’s wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas’s education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers’ salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history.[40] Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.[7][41] He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).[35]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Governor and Mrs. Clinton attend the Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors in the White House with President Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan, 1987.<br>\n Also in the 1980s, The Clintons’ personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration.[43] After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.[7][44]</p>\n <p>According to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions.[45][46] During Clinton’s term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973).[47] As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. Later, as president, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.[48]</p>\n <p>1988 Democratic presidential primaries<br>\n In 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the Presidential race after incumbent New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady).[49] For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice as long as it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long[50] and poorly delivered.[51] Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.[41][52]</p>\n <p>Presidency (1993–2001)</p>\n <p>Main article: Presidency of Bill Clinton</p>\n <p>Countries visited by President Bill Clinton during his terms in office.<br>\n During his presidency, Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs, most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance.[53][54] His policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters.[55][56] Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[57][58][59] The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69 billion in 1998, $126 billion in 1999, and $236 billion in 2000,[60] during the last three years of Clinton’s presidency.[61] Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000.[62][63] Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000.[64] At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to Chappaqua, New York in order to satisy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York.</p>\n <p>1992 presidential campaign<br>\n Further information: Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1992; United States presidential election, 1992; and Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992<br>\n In the first primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls.[7] Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him “The Comeback Kid” for earning a firm second-place finish.[65]</p>\n <p>Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.[7][52] With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.[52] Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown’s home state of California.[7]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>The Clintons in a White House Christmas portrait, 1993.<br>\n During the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary’s firm pay.[2][66] Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents “for the price of one”.[67]</p>\n <p>Clinton was still the Governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton’s return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a New York Times article as a possible political move to counter “soft on crime” accusations.[45][68]</p>\n <p>Bush’s approval ratings were around 80 percent during the Gulf War, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes, which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.[52] By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40 percent.[52][69] Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention—with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform—many moderates were alienated.[70] Clinton then pointed to his moderate, “New Democrat” record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.[71] Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton.[72] Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a “new beginning”.[72]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>1992 electoral vote results.<br>\n Clinton won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (0 electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush’s steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton’s success.[72] Clinton’s victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress,[3] the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.[73][74]</p>\n <p>First term (1993–1997)</p>\n <p>First inauguration of Bill Clinton (January 20, 1993)<br>\n File:First Inaugural (January 20, 1993) Bill Clinton.ogvPlay media<br>\n Video of the First inauguration of Bill Clinton<br>\n First inauguration of Bill Clinton (January 20, 1993)</p>\n <p>audio only version<br>\n Problems playing these files?

There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.”<br>\n Inaugural address, January 20, 1993.[75]<br>\n Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,[76] and was popular with the public.[77]</p>\n <p>Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993—the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade—Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.[78] Clinton said that abortion should be kept “safe, legal, and rare”—a slogan that had been suggested by University of California, San Diego political scientist Samuel L. Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.[79] During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent.[80]</p>\n <p>On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit.[81] Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.[82] Clinton’s advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.[83]</p>\n <p>On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office, causing the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.[84] Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.[85]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton and Vice President Al Gore on the South Lawn, August 10, 1993.<br>\n In August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15 million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90 percent of small businesses,[86] and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years through the implementation of spending restraints.[87]</p>\n <p>On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton’s legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.[44] Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.[41][44]</p>\n <p>In November 1993, David Hale—the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy—alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons’ partner in the Whitewater land deal.[88] A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife’s innocence in the affair.</p>\n <p>On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.[44]</p>\n <p>In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator. In the affair later known as “Troopergate”, the officers alleged that they arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated “bad journalism”, and that “the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives”.[89]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat during the Oslo Accords on September 13, 1993</p>\n <p>Clinton, Jordan’s King Hussein and Yitzhak Rabin sign the Israel–Jordan peace treaty on July 25, 1994.<br>\n Remarks on the Signing of NAFTA (December 8, 1993)<br>\n File:Remarks on the Signing of NAFTA (December 8, 1993) Bill Clinton.ogvPlay media<br>\n Clinton’s December 8, 1993 remarks on the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement<br>\n Remarks on the Signing of NAFTA (December 8, 1993)</p>\n <p>audio only version<br>\n Problems playing these files? See media help.<br>\n That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”, which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual’s sexual orientation.[90] The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton’s proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton’s support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that “the President should lift the ban … even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress”.[91] Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.[92] Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton’s defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.[41] Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not “out of whack”.[93] The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.[94]</p>\n <p>On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law.[95] Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.[95]</p>\n <p>The Omnibus Crime Bill, which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,[96] made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton’s re-election campaign he said, “My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.”[97] It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period.</p>\n <p>The Clinton administration also launched the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov, on October 21, 1994.[98][99] It was followed by three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.[100][101] The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, “Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America’s government to more of America’s citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011 – Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.”[102]</p>\n <p>After two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.[103]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton’s coat of arms, granted by the Chief Herald of Ireland in 1995</p>\n <p>Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in October 1995<br>\n The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.[104] In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined that there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray’s report further stated, “there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved” in seeking the files.[105]</p>\n <p>On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman, allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states.[106] Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that Clinton’s signing of DOMA “was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election”. In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was an attempt to “head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states”, a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a “very reactionary Congress”.[107] Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, “the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.”[108] Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something “which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it’s obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that”.[109] Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims “historic revisionism”.[108] In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, “The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.”[110] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.[111]</p>\n <p>Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,[112] and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights.[113] During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees[114] and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.[115] Under Clinton’s leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled.[116] Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.[117] Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton’s election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign.[113] Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009[118] and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.[119] He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.[120]</p>\n <p>“When I took office, only high energy physicists had ever heard of what is called the Worldwide Web … Now even my cat has its own page.”<br>\n Bill Clinton’s announcement of Next Generation Internet initiative, October 1996.[121]<br>\n The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself. The Chinese government denied all accusations.[122]</p>\n <p>As part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton,[123] the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.[124][125]</p>\n <p>Ken Gormley, author of The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED).[126] According to officials, the IED was large enough to “blow up the entire presidential motorcade”.[127] Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating that there was a wedding cake under a bridge.[126] This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton’s motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila.[127] Once more, the word “wedding” was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt.[127] Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high.[128] Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag.[129] Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base.[129] The president was scheduled to visit both of these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden.[127] Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.[127]</p>\n <p>1996 presidential election</p>\n <p>1996 electoral vote results.</p>\n <p>President Bill Clinton (center), first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton (right) and their daughter Chelsea (left) wave to watchers at a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day, January 20, 1997.<br>\n In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2 percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7 percent of the popular vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4 percent of the popular vote), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B. Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once.[130] The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70 percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.</p>\n <p>Second term (1997–2001)</p>\n <p>Al Gore and Newt Gingrich applaud as Clinton waves during the State of the Union address in 1997.<br>\n In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.[131] In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.[132]</p>\n <p>Impeachment and acquittal<br>\n Main article: Impeachment of Bill Clinton</p>\n <p>Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999<br>\n After the 1998 elections, the House impeached Clinton, alleging perjury and obstruction of justice related to the Lewinsky scandal.[44] Clinton was only the second U.S. president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson. Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky.[133] After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed “substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment”,[134] the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998.</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton shaking hands with future president Donald Trump at Trump Tower, June 2000<br>\n While the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton’s testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones’s sexual harassment lawsuit.[135] The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.</p>\n <p>The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges.[136] The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams &amp; Connolly.[137] The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge[136] and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.[138] Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.[136]</p>\n <p>On January 19, 2001, Clinton’s law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case.[139][140]</p>\n <p>Pardons and commutations<br>\n Clinton controversially issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.[44][141] Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton’s brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president’s decision-making regarding the pardons.[142] Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey, who found no wrongdoing on Clinton’s part. Some of Clinton’s pardons remain a point of controversy.[143]</p>\n <p>Military and foreign events<br>\n Further information: Foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration</p>\n <p>Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair in Florence, Italy on November 20, 1999.</p>\n <p>Clinton speaks with Col. Paul Fletcher, USAF, before boarding Air Force One, November 4, 1999.<br>\n Many military events occurred during Clinton’s presidency. The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets—a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft attacked Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>General John P. Jumper, U.S. Air Forces in Europe commander, escorts Clinton upon his arrival to Ramstein Air Base, Germany, May 5, 1999.

General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region.[152] NATO announced that its forces had suffered zero combat deaths,[153] and two deaths from an Apache helicopter crash.[154] Opinions in the popular press criticized pre-war genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated.[155][156] In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide did not take place, but recognized “a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments”.[157] The term “ethnic cleansing” was used as an alternative to “genocide” to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is no difference.[158] Slobodan Milošević, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges of crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes.[159] Milošević died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.[159][160]</p>\n <p>In Clinton’s 1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:</p>\n <p>Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation’s wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq’s arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, “You cannot defy the will of the world”, and when I say to him, “You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.[161]</p>\n <p>File:Video Recording of Photo Opportunity at Camp David – NARA – 6037428.ogvPlay media<br>\n President Clinton, Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Camp David, July 2000<br>\n Seeking to weaken Hussein’s grip on power, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of “regime change” against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.[162][163] The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that “So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.”[164] American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.[165][166]</p>\n <p>Clinton’s November 2000 visit to Vietnam was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the Vietnam War.[167] On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.–China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People’s Republic of China.[168] The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.[169] Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.[170]</p>\n <p>After initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which also led to the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000, which lasted 14 days.[44] Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton stated Arafat “missed the opportunity” to facilitate a “just and lasting peace”. In his autobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit.[2][171] Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.[44]</p>\n <p>Judicial appointments<br>\n Main articles: Bill Clinton Supreme Court candidates and List of federal judges appointed by Bill Clinton</p>\n <p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg accepting her nomination to the Supreme Court from President Clinton.<br>\n Clinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993[172] and Stephen Breyer in 1994.[173]</p>\n <p>Along with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts. His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies, as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. In all, 84 percent of his nominees were confirmed.[174]</p>\n <p>Sonia Sotomayor was one of the judges who Clinton appointed to the Court of Appeals. She was nominated by Clinton in 1997 to the Second Circuit. Sotomayor was confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year that was caused by Republican opposition.[175][176]</p>\n <p>Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.[177] In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton’s court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women.[178] Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams).[178] Clinton also appointed the nation’s first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.[179]</p>\n <p>Public opinion</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton’s approval ratings throughout his presidential career<br>\n Throughout Clinton’s first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[180] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton’s rating reached its highest point.[181] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68 percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[182] Clinton’s average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[183] Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[183]</p>\n <p>As he was leaving office, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll revealed that 45 percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55 percent thought he “would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life”; 68 percent thought he would be remembered more for his “involvement in personal scandal” than for “his accomplishments”; and 58 percent answered “No” to the question “Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?”[183] The same percentage said he would be remembered as either “outstanding” or “above average” as a president, while 22 percent said he would be remembered as “below average” or “poor”.[183] ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, “You can’t trust him, he’s got weak morals and ethics – and he’s done a heck of a good job.”[184]</p>\n <p>In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton’s job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.[185] Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.[186][187]</p>\n <p>In 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.[188] The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.[188]</p>\n <p>A 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness.

In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.[209] Jones appealed Webber Wright’s ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton’s admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.[210] In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton’s main lawyer for the case, called the filing “a pack of lies” and “an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States” funded by Clinton’s political enemies.[211] Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000.[212] Bennett said that the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life.[213] During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House,[214] Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky – a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.[215]</p>\n <p>In 1992, Gennifer Flowers stated that she had a relationship with Clinton that began in 1980.[216] Flowers at first denied that she had an affair with Clinton, but later changed her story.[217][218] After Clinton at first denied having a relationship with Flowers on 60 Minutes, he later admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.[219]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton speaking at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.<br>\n In 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave “false information” to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[220] On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey’s account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office.[221] An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.[222] Linda Tripp’s grand jury testimony also differed from Willey’s claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.[223]</p>\n <p>Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she stated she did not remember the exact date.[224] In another 1998 event, Elizabeth Gracen recanted a six-year-old denial and stated she had a one-night stand with Clinton in 1982.[225] Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton.[226] Throughout the year, however, Gracen eluded a subpoena from Kenneth Starr to testify her claim in court.[227]</p>\n <p>Post-presidency (2001–present)</p>\n <p>Main article: Post-presidency of Bill Clinton</p>\n <p>Clinton greets a Hurricane Katrina evacuee, September 5, 2005. In the background, second from the right, is then-Senator Barack Obama.<br>\n Bill Clinton continues to be active in public life, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations.[228] Clinton has spoken in prime time at every Democratic National Convention since 1988.[229] Robert Reich has suggested that Clinton is in a state of “permanent election”, due to the impeachment proceedings during his presidency and his continuing support in the campaigns of his wife Hillary Clinton.[230]</p>\n <p>Activities until 2008 campaign<br>\n In 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,[231][232] and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this).[233] In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.[234]</p>\n <p>The William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas was dedicated in 2004.[235] Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, My Life in 2004.[236] In 2007, he released Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World, which also became a New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews.[237]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Former president George H. W. Bush and Clinton in the White House Library, January 2005<br>\n In the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort.[238] After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year.[239] As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show,[240] and traveled to the affected areas.[241] They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.[242]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>The dedication of the Clinton Presidential Center, 2004<br>\n Based on his philanthropic worldview,[243] Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict.[244] In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools.[245] Clinton’s foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.[246] The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East.[247] In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30 percent in developing nations.[248] Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.[249]</p>\n <p>2008 presidential election</p>\n <p>Clinton speaking at the 2008 Democratic National Convention<br>\n During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary Clinton. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10 million toward her campaign.[250] Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.[251] Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary’s staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.[252] Considering Bill’s remarks, many thought that he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary.[253] Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama’s election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying that all his experience as president assures him that Obama is “ready to lead”.[254] After Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.[255][256]</p>\n <p>After the 2008 election</p>\n <p>Clinton with incumbent President Barack Obama and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett in July 2010<br>\n In 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.[257] Jimmy Carter had made a similar visit in 1994.[257] After Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.[258][259]</p>\n <p>Since then, Clinton has been assigned a number of other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009.[260] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti’s recovery.[261] Clinton continues to visit Haiti to witness the inauguration of refugee villages, and to raise funds for victims of the earthquake.[262] In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland’s first environmental foundation.[263][264] At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.[265]</p>\n <p>2016 presidential election</p>\n <p>Clinton campaigning at an election rally for his wife who was running to become the President of the United States, 2016<br>\n During the 2016 Presidential Election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary Clinton, including a campaign stop in Wilmington, NC.[266] In a series of tweets, then-President-Elect Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote.[267]</p>\n <p>After the 2016 election<br>\n On September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[268]</p>\n <p>Post-presidential health concerns<br>\n In September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery.[269] In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung.[270] On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart.[269][271] After this procedure, Clinton adopted the plant-based whole foods (vegan) diet, which had been recommended by doctors Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn.[272]</p>\n <p>Wealth</p>\n <p>Bill Clinton speaks at Central High School in Phoenix, Arizona, 2016.<br>\n The Clintons accrued several million dollars in legal fees during his presidency; the bills were paid off four years after he left office.[273] Bill and Hillary Clinton have both received millions of dollars in book authorship fees.[274] In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240 million in the 15 years from January 2001 to December 2015 (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing).[275] Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153 million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015.[276] In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25 million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5 million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period.[277] In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5 million and $25.5 million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17 million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president.[278] Clinton earned more than $104 million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012.[279] In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100 million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, the New York Times reported that the Clintons’ income tax returns[280] show they have made $109 million in the 8 years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92 million from his speaking and book-writing.[274][281][282][283]</p>\n <p>Bill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.[276][284][285][286] Hillary Clinton said that she and Bill came out of the White House financially “broke” and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. “We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea’s education.” She added, “Bill has worked really hard … we had to pay off all our debts … he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members.”[282]</p>\n <p>Honors and recognition</p>\n <p>Main article: List of honors and awards received by Bill Clinton</p>\n <p>Secretary of Defense Cohen presents President Clinton the DoD Medal for Distinguished Public Service.</p>\n <p>Bill Clinton statue in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo<br>\n Various colleges and universities have awarded Clinton honorary degrees, including Doctorate of Law degrees[287][288] and Doctor of Humane Letters degrees.[289] He is an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar, although he did not complete his studies there.[290][291] Schools have been named for Clinton,[292][293][294] and statues have been built to pay him homage.[295][296] U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri,[297] Arkansas,[298] Kentucky,[299] and New York.[300] He was presented with the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2001.[301] The Clinton Presidential Center was opened in Little Rock, Arkansas in his honor on December 5, 2001.[302]</p>\n <p>He has been honored in various other ways, in countries that include the Czech Republic,[303] Papua New Guinea,[304] Germany,[305] and Kosovo.[295] The Republic of Kosovo, in gratitude for his help during the Kosovo War, renamed a major street in the capital city of Pristina as Bill Clinton Boulevard and added a monumental Clinton statue.[306][307][308]</p>\n <p>Clinton was selected as Time’s “Man of the Year” in 1992,[309] and again in 1998, along with Ken Starr.[310] From a poll conducted of the American people in December 1999, Clinton was among eighteen included in Gallup’s List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century.[311] He was honored with a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children, a J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding,[312] a TED Prize (named for the confluence of technology, entertainment and design),[313] and was named as an Honorary GLAAD Media Award recipient for his work as an advocate for the LGBT community.[314]</p>\n <p>In 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Clinton with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Cross “for his various initiatives in Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country after the earthquake of January 12, 2010”. Clinton declared at the ceremony that “in the United States of America, I really don’t believe former American presidents need awards anymore, but I am very honored by this one, I love Haiti, and I believe in its promise”.[315]</p>\n <p>U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Clinton the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013.[316]</p>\n <p>Electoral history</p>\n <p>Year Office District Democratic Republican Other<br>\n 1974 Arkansas 3rd congressional district Arkansas Bill Clinton 48.17% John Paul Hammerschmidt 51.83%<br>\n 1976 Arkansas Attorney General Arkansas Bill Clinton Unopposed<br>\n 1978 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 63% Lynn Lowe 37%<br>\n 1980 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 48% Frank White 52%<br>\n 1982 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 55% Frank White 45%<br>\n 1984 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 63% Woody Freeman 37%<br>\n 1986 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 64% Frank White 36%<br>\n 1990 Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Bill Clinton 57% Sheffield Nelson 42%<br>\n 1992 President of the United States United States of America Bill Clinton 43% George H.

After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married Bill Clinton in 1975. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Rose Law Firm the following year. As First Lady of Arkansas, she led a task force whose recommendations helped reform Arkansas’s public schools.</p>\n <p>As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an advocate for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led to her issuing a statement reaffirming her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female Senator from New York. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.[2]</p>\n <p>As Secretary of State in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013, Clinton responded to the Arab Spring, during which she advocated the U.S. military intervention in Libya. She helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country’s nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Leaving office after Obama’s first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements.</p>\n <p>Clinton made a second presidential run in 2016. She received the most votes and primary delegates in the 2016 Democratic primaries and formally accepted her party’s nomination for President of the United States on July 28, 2016 with vice presidential running mate Senator Tim Kaine. She became the first female candidate to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party. Despite winning the national popular vote, Clinton lost the electoral vote and the presidency to her Republican opponent Donald Trump.[3] Following her loss, in 2017 she stated that she decided to focus on being a self-described “activist citizen”.[4]</p>\n <p>Contents</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Early life<br>\n Museum display case containing photographs, papers, shoes, doll, and other early childhood artifacts of Hillary Rodham’s early life<br>\n Mementos of Hillary Rodham’s early life are shown at the William J. Clinton Presidential Center<br>\n Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.[5][6] Clinton was raised in a United Methodist family that first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge.[7] Her father, Hugh Rodham (1911–1993), was of English and Welsh descent,[8] and managed a small but successful textile business.[9] Her mother, Dorothy Howell (1919–2011), was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent.[8][10][11] Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[12]</p>\n <p>As a child, Rodham was a favorite student of her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge.[13] She participated in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.[13] She has often told a story[14][15][16] of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[17] She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[5][18] She was elected class vice president for her junior year, but then lost for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that “you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president”.[19] For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted “most likely to succeed”. She graduated in her class’s top five percent in 1965.[20]</p>\n <p>Rodham’s mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career,[11] and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter’s abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[21] Raised in a politically conservative household,[11] Rodham helped canvass Chicago’s South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon.[22] She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[23] Rodham’s early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater’s The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago’s Orchestra Hall.[24]</p>\n <p>Wellesley College years<br>\n In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[25][26] During her freshman year, she served as president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[27][28] As the leader of this “Rockefeller Republican”-oriented group,[29] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to Mayor of New York City and Massachusetts Attorney General Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[30] She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the American Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[27] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as “a mind conservative and a heart liberal”.[31] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[32][33]</p>\n <p>By her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[34] In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969.[32][35] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley’s black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[34] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[32][36] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.[32]</p>\n <p>To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference and she attended the “Wellesley in Washington” summer program.[34] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[34] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon’s campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention’s “veiled” racist messages and left the Republican Party for good.[34] Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[37] (Years later, while she was first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[37])</p>\n <p>In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[38] with departmental honors in political science.[37] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke.[35][39] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[32][40][41] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[42][43] due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[39] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet’s nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[44] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).[45]</p>\n <p>Yale Law School and postgraduate studies<br>\n Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she served on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[46] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[47] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48][49] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital[48] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.[47] In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman’s Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale’s Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers’ issues including education, health and housing.[50] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[51] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[52]</p>\n <p>In the late spring of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, who was also a law student at Yale. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);[53] Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[a] Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California;[57] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[54] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.[58] She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[38] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.[59] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[59]</p>\n <p>Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[60] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, “Children Under the Law”, was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[61] Discussing the new children’s rights movement, the article stated that “child citizens” were “powerless individuals”[62] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis.[63] The article became frequently cited in the field.[64]</p>\n <p>Marriage, family, law career and First Lady of Arkansas</p>\n <p>From the East Coast to Arkansas<br>\n During her postgraduate study, Rodham served as staff attorney for Edelman’s newly founded Children’s Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[65] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[66] In 1974 she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., advising the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[67] Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,[48] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for impeachment.[67] The committee’s work culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[67]</p>\n <p>By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham’s career.[68] Wright thought she had the potential to become a future senator or president.[69] Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him and she continued to demur.[70] After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[71] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, “I chose to follow my heart instead of my head”.[72] She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.[73][74]</p>\n <p>Early Arkansas years<br>\n At the university, Rodham gave classes in criminal law, where she was considered to be a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.[75] She became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.[76] In one of her cases, she was mandated by the court to serve as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. Clinton used an effective defense that led her client to plead guilty to a much lesser charge. Decades later, the victim said that the defense counsel had put her “through hell” during the legal process; Hillary Clinton has called the trial a “terrible case”.[77] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city’s first rape crisis center.[76] Rodham still harbored doubts about marriage, concerned that her separate identity would be lost and her accomplishments viewed in the light of someone else’s.[78]</p>\n <p>Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she finally agreed to marry him.[79] Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.[80] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham.[81][82] The motivation was to keep the couple’s professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because, as she told a friend at the time, “it showed that I was still me.”[83] The decision upset both of their more traditional mothers.[84] Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[85] There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[86] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[46] while also working pro bono in child advocacy;[87] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[88]</p>\n <p>Rodham maintained her interest in children’s law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles “Children’s Policies: Abandonment and Neglect” in 1977[89] and “Children’s Rights: A Legal Perspective” in 1979.[90] The latter continued her argument that children’s legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, “Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.”[63] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as “one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades”,[91] while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[92] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[63] and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.[93]</p>\n <p>A small, one-story brick-faced house with a small yard in front. This house is located in Little Rock, Arkansas. Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton lived in this house when Bill was Arkansas Attorney General from 1977 to 1979.<br>\n Rodham and Clinton lived in this house in Little Rock’s Hillcrest neighborhood while he was Arkansas Attorney General (1977–1979).[94]<br>\n In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children’s Defense Fund.[46][95] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[96] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation,[97] and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981.[98] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[b] she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job.[99] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan’s attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[87]</p>\n <p>Following her husband’s November 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state’s First Lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve years (1979–81, 1983–92). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[100] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas’s poorest areas without affecting doctors’ fees.[101]</p>\n <p>In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm.[102] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[103] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[104] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[105] At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[104] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.</p>\n <p>On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to her only child, daughter Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[106]</p>\n <p>Later Arkansas years<br>\n The Reagans and the Clintons walking a red carpet during the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors<br>\n Governor Bill and First Lady Hillary Clinton attend the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors with President Ronald and First Lady Nancy Reagan.<br>\n Bill Clinton returned to the governor’s office two years later after winning the election of 1982. During her husband’s campaign, Hillary began to use the name “Hillary Clinton”, or sometimes “Mrs. Bill Clinton”, to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.[107] As First Lady of Arkansas again, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[c] She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state’s court-sanctioned public education system.[113][114] In one of the Clinton governorship’s most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[100][113] It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[82][113] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas’s Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[115] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[116][117]</p>\n <p>Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was First Lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours,[118] but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[119] The firm considered her a “rainmaker” because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[119] Bill Clinton’s Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest, because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[120]</p>\n <p>From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[121] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[122] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it.[123] She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 and in 1991.[124] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final time.[125]</p>\n <p>Formal color portrait of Clinton, 1992<br>\n Clinton in 1992<br>\n Clinton served as Chairman of the Board of the Children’s Defense Fund[5][126] and on the board of the Arkansas Children’s Hospital’s Legal Services (1988–92)[127] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–92),[128] Wal-Mart Stores (1986–92)[129] and Lafarge (1990–92).[130] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[119][131] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart’s board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[131] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be added to the company’s management and was silent about the company’s famously anti-labor union practices.[129][131][132]</p>\n <p>Bill Clinton presidential campaign of 1992<br>\n Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[133] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged “causing pain in my marriage”.[134] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[135] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette’s outlook on marriage as described in her classic song “Stand by Your Man”,[d] and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would “get two for the price of one”, referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[141] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg’s August 1992 The American Spectator article “The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock”, Hillary’s own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[92] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[142]</p>\n <p>First Lady of the United States</p>\n <p>When Bill Clinton took office as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press secretary reiterated that she would be using that form of her name.[c] She was the first inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[143] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[60][144] She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[145] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[146][147]</p>\n <p>Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton’s role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband’s presidency.[148] Bill Clinton’s campaign promise of “two for the price of one” led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as “co-presidents” or sometimes use the Arkansas label “Billary”.[100][149][150] The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into “imaginary discussions” with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt.[f] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.[154][155] Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner’s “politics of meaning” to overcome what she saw as America’s “sleeping sickness of the soul”; that would lead to a willingness “to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium.”[156][157]</p>\n <p>Health care and other policy initiatives<br>\n See also: Clinton health care plan of 1993</p>\n <p>Clinton at a presentation on her health care plan in September 1993<br>\n In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[158] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[159][160] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as “Hillarycare” and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress.[161] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[161]</p>\n <p>Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[162] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady’s approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44 percent in April 1994 and 35 percent by September 1994.[163]</p>\n <p>Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections.[164] Republicans saw a net gain of fifty-three seats in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats’ defeat, especially among independent voters.[165] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton’s role in shaping policy.[166] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use “Hillarycare” as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[167]</p>\n <p>Clinton reads a book to an African-American grade-schooler in Maryland during Read Across America Day in 1998<br>\n Clinton reads to a Maryland child during Read Across America Day, 1998<br>\n Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.[168] She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare.[169] She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.[60]</p>\n <p>Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton’s presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming off welfare, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.[170][171] A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again.[170] But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.[170][171] This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called “sad and painful”.[171]</p>\n <p>Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.[60] In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as first lady.[60][172] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care.[172] As first lady, Clinton was the host for various White House conferences, including ones on Child Care (1997),[173] on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997),[174] and on Children and Adolescents (2000).[175] She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000)[176] and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999).[177]</p>\n <p>Clinton traveled to 79 countries during this time,[178] breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon.[179] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[180] A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan.[181] Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps.[182] The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.[183]</p>\n <p>File:First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton’s Remarks to the Fourth Women’s Conference in Beijing, China.webmPlay media<br>\n Clinton delivering her “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights” speech in Beijing in September 1995 (20:19)<br>\n In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued very forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People’s Republic of China itself, declaring that “it is no longer acceptable to discuss women’s rights as separate from human rights”.[184] Delegates from over 180 countries heard her say: “If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights, once and for all.”[185] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[178][185] The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton’s key phrases.[186] She was one of the most prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[187][188] She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.[189] It and Clinton’s own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.[190]</p>\n <p>Whitewater and other investigations<br>\n For more details on these investigations, see Whitewater controversy, Travelgate, Filegate, and Hillary Clinton cattle futures controversy.<br>\n First Lady Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress and the press.</p>\n <p>The Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign[191] and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm[192] and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton’s work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed.[191] She said she had done minimal work for the bank.[193] Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton’s legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.[194][195] The records were found in the First Lady’s White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996.[195] The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been.[195] Clinton’s staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion.[196] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[194] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[197]</p>\n <p>Chelsea, Bill, and Hillary Clinton take an inauguration day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 1997, when Bill started a second term as President.<br>\n The Clintons take an Inauguration Day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to start Bill’s second term as President, January 20, 1997<br>\n Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an affair that became known as “Travelgate”, began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.[198] The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.[199][200] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made “factually false” statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false, or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.[201]</p>\n <p>In March 1994, newspaper reports revealed her spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978–79.[202] Allegations were made in the press of conflict of interest and disguised bribery and several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.[203]</p>\n <p>An outgrowth of the “Travelgate” investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called “Filegate”.[204] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and that she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[205] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[204]</p>\n <p>There was a controversy that arose in early 2001 over gifts made to the White House, rather than to the Clintons personally, that were removed and shipped to the Clintons’ private residence during the last year of Bill Clinton’s time in office.[206][207]</p>\n <p>Response to Lewinsky scandal<br>\n Further information: Lewinsky scandal<br>\n In 1998, the Clintons’ relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had engaged in an extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[208] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the President by the House of Representatives and later acquittal by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a “vast right-wing conspiracy”,[209][210] characterizing the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill’s political enemies[g] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said that she had been misled by her husband’s initial claims that no affair had taken place.[212] After the evidence of President Clinton’s encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage, but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage.[213] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.[214]</p>\n <p>Public reaction varied. Some women admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public, some sympathized with her as a victim of her husband’s insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an enabler to her husband’s indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.[215] Her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around 70 percent, the highest they had ever been.[215] In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to “a love that has persisted for decades” and add: “No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.”[216]</p>\n <p>Issues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills; in 2014, Hillary would state that she and Bill had left the White House “not only dead broke, but in debt.” The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who gave paid speeches after leaving office as well as the couple’s ability to secure loans from banks.[217]</p>\n <p>Traditional duties<br>\n Clinton initiated and was the founding chair of Save America’s Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations in order to preserve and restore historic items and sites,[218] including the flag that inspired “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the First Ladies Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[60] She was head of the White House Millennium Council[219] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[220] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[60] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned from museums.[221]</p>\n <p>In the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the state rooms.[60] She oversaw the restoration of the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe[222] and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II.[223] Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter.[224] These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines.[223] Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.[224] Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year’s Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[60]</p>\n <p>United States Senate</p>\n <p>Main article: United States Senate career of Hillary Clinton<br>\n 2000 U.S. Senate election<br>\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2000<br>\n When New York’s long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan’s open seat in the Senate election of 2000.[225] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.[226] She became the first First Lady of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.[227] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York’s 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state’s politics before the 2000 Senate race.[228]</p>\n <p>Clinton began her campaign, which was managed by Bill de Blasio, by visiting all 62 counties in the State, in a “listening tour” of small-group settings.[229] She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000 jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.[230]</p>\n <p>The contest drew national attention. Lazio blundered during a September debate by seeming to invade Clinton’s personal space trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.[231] The campaigns of Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani’s initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million.[232] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55 percent of the vote to Lazio’s 43 percent.[231] She was sworn in as U.S. Senator on January 3, 2001,[233] making her the first (and so far only) woman to have held an elected office either while,[h] or after, serving as first lady.</p>\n <p>First term<br>\n Clinton being sworn in as U.S. Senator by Vice President Al Gore in 2000.

Working with New York’s senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center site’s redevelopment.[241] She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.[242] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties,[243] before voting in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 in March 2006 that gained large majority support.[244]</p>\n <p>Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[245] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[246]</p>\n <p>After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[247] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain.[248] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush’s pledge to stay “until the job is done” was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis “an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves”.[249] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.[250] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York.[251][252] She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers.[252] (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying that she “got it wrong” and the vote in support had been a “mistake”.[253])</p>\n <p>Clinton voted against President Bush’s two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[254] Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[255][256]</p>\n <p>In 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[257] Along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[254][258]</p>\n <p>Looking to establish a “progressive infrastructure” to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration Chief of Staff John Podesta’s Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons’ former antagonist David Brock’s Media Matters for America, created in 2004.[259] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.[260]</p>\n <p>2006 re-election campaign<br>\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2006<br>\n In November 2004, Clinton announced that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[261] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance.[262] Clinton’s eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67 percent of the vote to Spencer’s 31 percent,[263] carrying all but four of New York’s sixty-two counties.[264] Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.[265] In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.[266]</p>\n <p>Second term<br>\n Clinton listens as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee.

In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[269] Clinton responded to General David Petraeus’s September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, “I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.”[270]</p>\n <p>In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[271] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[272]</p>\n <p>As the financial crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700 billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying that it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74–25.[273]</p>\n <p>In 2007, Clinton and Virginia Senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[274]</p>\n <p>2008 presidential campaign</p>\n <p>Main articles: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008 and Hillary Clinton presidential primary campaign, 2008<br>\n Clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. President since at least early 2003.[275] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating “I’m in and I’m in to win.”[276] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency and no First Lady had ever run for President. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed that the couple’s worth was now upwards of $50 million,[277] and that they had earned over $100 million since 2000, with most of it coming from Bill’s books, speaking engagements and other activities.[278]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton addresses the 2007 CDA National Convention<br>\n Throughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[246] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[246] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[279] At the end of October, Clinton suffered a poor debate performance against Obama, Edwards and her other opponents.[280][281] Obama’s message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton’s message of experience.[282]</p>\n <p>Clinton speaking at a college rally as part of her 2008 Presidential campaign, with a crowd behind her looking on.

Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[288] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[j] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[289] Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[288][290] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[290] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February 5 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former President “needs to stop”.[291] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Hillary Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[292]</p>\n <p>Chart of 50 states, showing state-by-state popular votes in the Democratic primaries and caucuses, shaded by percentage won.

The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev’s time in office, but relations would worsen considerably following Vladimir Putin’s return to the position in 2012.[326] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton’s intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish–Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[328][329] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[183][l] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country’s nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[310][331][332]</p>\n <p>Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president.[333][334] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[335] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[310] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[334] moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon.[336][337] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.[310]</p>\n <p>Clinton greeting U.S. military personnel at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.

She is standing behind a blue podium with a sign that has the words “THE LONDON CONFERENCE ON LIBYA” printed in white-on-blue text in capital letters.<br>\n The London meeting to discuss NATO military intervention in Libya, March 29, 2011<br>\n As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton’s shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[344][345][346] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution and the State Department’s legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution’s 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[347] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called “convening power” to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[345] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state,[348] and the wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[349][350][351]</p>\n <p>During April 2011 internal deliberations of the president’s innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[352][353] Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden’s death, Clinton played a key role in the administration’s decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[354] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).[252][355]</p>\n <p>Clinton standing with Aung San Suu Kyi.

Several of the attendees are sitting down, while others stand behind them. Everyone in the room is watching a live feed from drones operating over the Osama bin Laden complex.<br>\n Throughout her time in office and in her final speech concluding it, Clinton viewed “smart power” as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values—in a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities—by combining military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy.[345][370] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.[371] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[252][335][355] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[372]</p>\n <p>Clinton greatly expanded the State Department’s use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, both to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-à-vis their governments.[345] And in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[185] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the “Hillary Doctrine”, she viewed women’s rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[333][373] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.[374]</p>\n <p>Clinton visited 112 countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[375][n] (Time magazine wrote that “Clinton’s endurance is legendary”).[345] The first secretary of state to visit countries such as Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[378] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as Secretary of State should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[346] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton’s successor.[365] Her last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013.[379] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton’s tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other Secretaries of State had,[336][337] and highlighted her focus on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.[380]</p>\n <p>Benghazi attack and subsequent hearings<br>\n See also: 2012 Benghazi attack and United States House Select Committee on Benghazi<br>\n Obama and Clinton at a somber occasion, honoring the Benghazi attack victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony, held at Andrews Air Force Base on September 14, 2012.

Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[381] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[381][382]</p>\n <p>On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[383] It focused its criticism on the department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[384] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[383]</p>\n <p>Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[385] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate “talking points” after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, “With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.”[385][386] In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration’s response to the attack.[387]</p>\n <p>Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015. She is standing behind a podium with a microphone, with many people behind her.<br>\n Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015<br>\n The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack.[388] Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics.[388][389] This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton’s poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans’ previous talking points on the investigation.[388][390] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[391][392] The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves.[391] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[393] The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines,[388] with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.[389]</p>\n <p>Email controversy<br>\n Main article: Hillary Clinton email controversy<br>\n A controversy arose in March 2015, when it was revealed by the State Department’s inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton’s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[394][395]</p>\n <p>In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and “never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.” They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[396] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[397] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called “born classified” category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[398] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton’s server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[399] Additionally, the intelligence community’s inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails “contained classified State Department information when originated.”[400] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[401]</p>\n <p>Clinton maintained that she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, “I never sent or received any classified material – they are retroactively classifying it.” On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: “Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.”[402][403]</p>\n <p>On July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said:</p>\n <p>110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were “up-classified” to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[399][404]</p>\n <p>Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small “c” in parentheses, described as “portion markings” by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not “technically sophisticated” enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.[404] The probe found that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI assessed that it “is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account.” Comey stated that although Clinton or her colleagues were “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information”, the FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that “no charges are appropriate in this case.”[399] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed that the probe into Clinton’s use of private email servers while secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges.[405]</p>\n <p>On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI started looking into newly discovered emails. Law enforcement officials stated while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered e-mails related to Clinton’s private server on a laptop computer belonging to Anthony Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its conclusion reached in July.[406] The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election.[407]</p>\n <p>Clinton Foundation and speeches</p>\n <p>Main article: Clinton Foundation<br>\n Clinton standing behind lectern<br>\n Clinton in September 2014<br>\n When Clinton left the State Department, she became a private citizen for the first time in thirty years.[408] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[409] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[409][410]</p>\n <p>Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[411] its March 2015 report said that while “There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman … this data shows just how far we still have to go.”[412] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary.[o] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[415]</p>\n <p>She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[416] There she received $200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[416][417] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[416] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11 million from her speeches.[418] For the overall period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141 million, paid some $56 million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15 million to charity.[419] As of 2015, she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her own, or $45–53 million with her husband.[420]</p>\n <p>Clinton resigned from the foundation’s board in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign and the foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[o]</p>\n <p>2016 presidential campaign</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton campaigning for president in Manchester, New Hampshire, in October 2016, with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (seated)<br>\n Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016<br>\n Further information: United States presidential election, 2016; Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016; and Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016<br>\n On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[421] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure.[422] The campaign’s headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[423] Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act.[424][425] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[421] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton’s Wall Street ties.[417][425]</p>\n <p>In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders,[426][427] making her the first woman to win the Iowa caucuses.[426] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[428] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[429] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[430] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[429] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[429]</p>\n <p>On March 1 (“Super Tuesday”), Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[431] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[432][433][434]</p>\n <p>By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[435] On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[436] By campaign’s end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders’ 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders’ 47.[437] She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders’ 13 million.[438]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Bernie Sanders endorsing Clinton in New Hampshire, July 2016<br>\n Clinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.[439] Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following day.[440] Her opponents in the general election were Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party.</p>\n <p>Clinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton became tied in major polls following the FBI’s conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[441] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her handling of classified government material.[442] In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention, in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it is toward the small side by historical standards.[443][444] Following Clinton’s 7 percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[445][446]</p>\n <p>Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016 presidential election.[447] By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win and media sources proclaimed him the winner.[448] Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave a victory speech.[449] The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying “We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.”[450] Though Clinton lost the election by only capturing 232 electors to Trump’s 306, a month after the election the popular vote count showed her leading by more than 2.7 million votes, with many votes yet to be counted.[451] She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.[452][453]</p>\n <p>On December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes instead being cast for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.[454]</p>\n <p>Clinton speaking behind a podium with a microphone in her hand.

Clinton is in favor of maintaining U.S. influence in the Middle East.<br>\n Several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton’s place on the political spectrum scientifically using her Senate votes. National Journal’s 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[472] National Journal’s subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[473] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her to be likely the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[474] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75 liberal, 23 conservative; Social = 83 liberal, 6 conservative; Foreign = 66 liberal, 30 conservative. Total average = 75 liberal, 20 conservative.[p] According to FiveThirtyEight’s measure of political ideology, “Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.”[475]</p>\n <p>Organizations have also attempted to give newer assessments of Clinton once she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in their “Left Liberal” region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances and an economic score of 10 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[476] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[477] Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90 percent “Liberal Quotient” from Americans for Democratic Action,[478] and a lifetime 8 percent rating from the American Conservative Union.[479]</p>\n <p>In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called “optimistic” and “wide-ranging”. Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a “clawback” that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an “exit tax” on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[480] Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as “the gold standard”[481] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that “any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security”.[482][483] As Senator (2001–2009), her record on trade was mixed, voting in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[482]</p>\n <p>Given the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit “unaccountable money” in politics.[484] In July 2016, she “committed” to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.[485][486] On December 7, 2015, in The New York Times, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities.[487]</p>\n <p>Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign logo, a large blue letter “H” with a red arrow facing right, overlaying the horizontal bar of the “H”.

It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn’t politicized…. Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven’t had that and so don’t understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.”[503]</p>\n <p>On foreign affairs, Clinton voted in October 2002 in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq,[504] a vote she later “regretted.”[505] She favored arming Syria’s rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[506] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[507][508] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[501] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, “America can’t ever be neutral when it comes to Israel’s security and survival.”[509] Clinton expressed support for Israel’s right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[510][511] In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields.[512]</p>\n <p>In 2000, Clinton advocated for eliminating the electoral college[513] and promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it resulting in the direct election of the president.[514][515]</p>\n <p>Religious views</p>\n <p>Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church:</p>\n <p>First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge, Illinois—in her early life,<br>\n First United Methodist Church of Little Rock, Arkansas—while in Arkansas,<br>\n Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C.—as First Lady of the United States,<br>\n Metropolitan Community United Methodist Church in New York, New York—currently a congregant.<br>\n She discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.[516] However, she has infrequently discussed her faith while campaigning.[517][518] Clinton has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one’s neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and “creating opportunities for others to be lifted up”.[518] Clinton has also expressed disappointment that “Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.”[518]</p>\n <p>Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has suggested that Clinton’s political positions are rooted in her faith. Clinton often expresses a certain maxim which is often attributed to John Wesley: “Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.”[517] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy “made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith.”[519]</p>\n <p>Writings and recordings</p>\n <p>See also: Bibliography of Hillary Clinton<br>\n External video<br>\n Booknotes interview with Clinton about It Takes a Village, March 3, 1996, C-SPAN<br>\n Informal pose of Clinton, in which she is wearing a beige wool jacket and facing toward the right.

The book made the Best Seller list of The New York Times and Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book’s audio recording.[522] She was the first First Lady to win a Grammy Award.[523]</p>\n <p>Other books published by Clinton when she was first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids’ Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children’s book Beatrice’s Goat.[524]</p>\n <p>In 2003, Clinton released a 562-page autobiography, Living History, for which publisher Simon &amp; Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8 million.[525] The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[526] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[527] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[528] Clinton’s audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[529]</p>\n <p>In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as Secretary of State. As of July 2015, the book has sold about 280,000 copies.[530]</p>\n <p>In 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States if they had won the 2016 presidential election.[531]</p>\n <p>Clinton authored her third memoir, What Happened, about the 2016 election, which was released on September 12, 2017, by Simon &amp; Schuster, in print, e-book, and audio read by the author.[532] A book tour and series of interviews and personal appearances were arranged for the launch.[533]</p>\n <p>Cultural and political image</p>\n <p>Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton, from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found “a virtual cottage industry” of “anti-Clinton literature”, put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints, with titles such as Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary’s Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton’s Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless … Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[534] (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[535] Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable “bogeyman” to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[536]</p>\n <p>Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture from a wide spectrum of varying perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[537] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, “Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.”[538] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as first lady and has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers.[539][540] Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her, including but not limited to “The Hillary Shimmy Song”, which went viral.[541][542][543][544]</p>\n <p>A three-story, red brick building in Arkansas.

Her professional career and political involvement set the stage for public reaction to her as first lady.<br>\n Clinton has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, with some arguing otherwise.[545] James Madison University political science professor Valerie Sulfaro’s 2007 study used the American National Election Studies’ “feeling thermometer” polls, which measure the degree of opinion about a political figure, to find that such polls during Clinton’s first lady years confirm the “conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure”, with the added insight that “affect towards Mrs. Clinton as first lady tended to be very positive or very negative, with a fairly constant one fourth of respondents feeling ambivalent or neutral”.[546] University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson’s 2006 study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state’s senators, Clinton had the fourth-largest partisan difference of any senator, with a 50-percentage-point difference in approval between New York’s Democrats and Republicans.[547]</p>\n <p>Northern Illinois University political science professor Barbara Burrell’s 2000 study found that Clinton’s Gallup poll favorability numbers broke sharply along partisan lines throughout her time as first lady, with 70 to 90 percent of Democrats typically viewing her favorably while only 20 to 40 percent of Republicans did.[548] University of Wisconsin–Madison political science professor Charles Franklin analyzed her record of favorable versus unfavorable ratings in public opinion polls and found that there was more variation in them during her first lady years than her Senate years. The Senate years showed favorable ratings around 50 percent and unfavorable ratings in the mid-40 percent range; Franklin noted that, “This sharp split is, of course, one of the more widely remarked aspects of Sen. Clinton’s public image.”[549] McGill University professor of history Gil Troy titled his 2006 biography of her Hillary Rodham Clinton: Polarizing First Lady and wrote that after the 1992 campaign, Clinton “was a polarizing figure, with 42 percent [of the public] saying she came closer to their values and lifestyle than previous first ladies and 41 percent disagreeing.”[550] Troy further wrote that Clinton “has been uniquely controversial and contradictory since she first appeared on the national radar screen in 1992” and that she “has alternately fascinated, bedeviled, bewitched and appalled Americans.”[551]</p>\n <p>Line chart showing Clinton’s favorability rankings from 1992 to 2016.

She is speaking into a microphone.<br>\n Clinton in 2009<br>\n Going into the early stages of her presidential campaign for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled “Love Her”, “Hate Her”,[557] while Mother Jones titled its profile of her “Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary”.[558] Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates,[559] while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all.[560][561] An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled “The Waning Power of Hillary Hate”.[562] By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation.[563] She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton’s laugh,[564] that “We know that there’s language to condemn female speech that doesn’t exist for male speech. We call women’s speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton’s laugh was being described as a cackle.”[563] The “bitch” epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics,[565] flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well.[566] Following Clinton’s “choked up moment” and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender’s role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[567][568] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events “brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades … she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics.”[568]</p>\n <p>Hillary Clinton dressed in a black suit and a green shirt, sitting in a café.

It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics.[572] Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, “There’s a certain consistency to who I am and what I do and I think people have finally said, ‘Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'”[333] She continued to do well in Gallup’s most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.[573]</p>\n <p>Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[574] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[575] During 2016 she acknowledged that: “I’m not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed.”[576] In July 2017 Bloomberg showed her approval rating at 39 percent.[577]</p>\n <p>Electoral history</p>\n <p>Main article: Electoral history of Hillary Clinton<br>\n New York United States Senate election, 2000<br>\n Party Candidate Votes % ±<br>\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 3,747,310 55.3<br>\n Republican Rick Lazio 2,915,730 43.0<br>\n New York United States Senate election, 2006<br>\n Party Candidate Votes % ±<br>\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 3,008,428 67.0 +11.7<br>\n Republican John Spencer 1,392,189 31.0 −12.0<br>\n Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008<br>\n Party Candidate Votes %<br>\n Democratic Barack Obama 17,584,692 (popular votes)<br>\n 2,272.5 delegates<br>\n (33 states) 47.3% of popular vote<br>\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 17,857,501 (popular votes)<br>\n 1,978 delegates<br>\n (23 states) 48.0% of popular vote<br>\n Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016<br>\n Party Candidate Votes %<br>\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 16,914,722 (popular votes)<br>\n 2,842 delegates<br>\n (34 states) 55.2% of popular vote<br>\n Democratic Bernie Sanders 13,206,428 (popular votes)<br>\n 1,865 delegates<br>\n (23 states) 43.1% of popular vote<br>\n United States presidential election, 2016<br>\n Party Candidate Votes %<br>\n Republican Donald Trump 62,979,879 (popular votes)<br>\n 304 electors<br>\n (30 states + ME-02) 46.0% (popular vote)<br>\n 56.5% (electoral vote)<br>\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 65,844,954 (popular votes)<br>\n 227 electors<br>\n (20 states + DC) 48.1% (popular vote)<br>\n 42.2% (electoral vote)</p>\n <p>Early life<br>\n Museum display case containing photographs, papers, shoes, doll, and other early childhood artifacts of Hillary Rodham’s early life<br>\n Mementos of Hillary Rodham’s early life are shown at the William J. Clinton Presidential Center<br>\n Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.[5][6] Clinton was raised in a United Methodist family that first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge.[7] Her father, Hugh Rodham (1911–1993), was of English and Welsh descent,[8] and managed a small but successful textile business.[9] Her mother, Dorothy Howell (1919–2011), was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent.[8][10][11] Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[12]</p>\n <p>As a child, Rodham was a favorite student of her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge.[13] She participated in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.[13] She has often told a story[14][15][16] of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[17] She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[5][18] She was elected class vice president for her junior year, but then lost for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that “you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president”.[19] For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted “most likely to succeed”. She graduated in her class’s top five percent in 1965.[20]</p>\n <p>Rodham’s mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career,[11] and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter’s abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[21] Raised in a politically conservative household,[11] Rodham helped canvass Chicago’s South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon.[22] She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[23] Rodham’s early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater’s The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago’s Orchestra Hall.[24]</p>\n <p>Wellesley College years<br>\n In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[25][26] During her freshman year, she served as president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[27][28] As the leader of this “Rockefeller Republican”-oriented group,[29] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to Mayor of New York City and Massachusetts Attorney General Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[30] She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the American Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[27] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as “a mind conservative and a heart liberal”.[31] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[32][33]</p>\n <p>By her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[34] In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969.[32][35] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley’s black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[34] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[32][36] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.[32]</p>\n <p>To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference and she attended the “Wellesley in Washington” summer program.[34] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[34] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon’s campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention’s “veiled” racist messages and left the Republican Party for good.[34] Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[37] (Years later, while she was first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[37])</p>\n <p>In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[38] with departmental honors in political science.[37] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke.[35][39] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[32][40][41] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[42][43] due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[39] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet’s nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[44] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).[45]</p>\n <p>Yale Law School and postgraduate studies<br>\n Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she served on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[46] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[47] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48][49] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital[48] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.[47] In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman’s Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale’s Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers’ issues including education, health and housing.[50] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[51] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[52]</p>\n <p>In the late spring of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, who was also a law student at Yale. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);[53] Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[a] Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California;[57] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[54] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.[58] She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[38] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.[59] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[59]</p>\n <p>Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[60] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, “Children Under the Law”, was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[61] Discussing the new children’s rights movement, the article stated that “child citizens” were “powerless individuals”[62] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis.[63] The article became frequently cited in the field.[64]</p>\n <p>Marriage, family, law career and First Lady of Arkansas</p>\n <p>From the East Coast to Arkansas<br>\n During her postgraduate study, Rodham served as staff attorney for Edelman’s newly founded Children’s Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[65] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[66] In 1974 she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., advising the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[67] Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,[48] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for impeachment.[67] The committee’s work culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[67]</p>\n <p>By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham’s career.[68] Wright thought she had the potential to become a future senator or president.[69] Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him and she continued to demur.[70] After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[71] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, “I chose to follow my heart instead of my head”.[72] She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.[73][74]</p>\n <p>Early Arkansas years<br>\n At the university, Rodham gave classes in criminal law, where she was considered to be a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.[75] She became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.[76] In one of her cases, she was mandated by the court to serve as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. Clinton used an effective defense that led her client to plead guilty to a much lesser charge. Decades later, the victim said that the defense counsel had put her “through hell” during the legal process; Hillary Clinton has called the trial a “terrible case”.[77] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city’s first rape crisis center.[76] Rodham still harbored doubts about marriage, concerned that her separate identity would be lost and her accomplishments viewed in the light of someone else’s.[78]</p>\n <p>Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she finally agreed to marry him.[79] Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.[80] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham.[81][82] The motivation was to keep the couple’s professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because, as she told a friend at the time, “it showed that I was still me.”[83] The decision upset both of their more traditional mothers.[84] Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[85] There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[86] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[46] while also working pro bono in child advocacy;[87] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[88]</p>\n <p>Rodham maintained her interest in children’s law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles “Children’s Policies: Abandonment and Neglect” in 1977[89] and “Children’s Rights: A Legal Perspective” in 1979.[90] The latter continued her argument that children’s legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, “Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.”[63] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as “one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades”,[91] while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[92] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[63] and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.[93]</p>\n <p>A small, one-story brick-faced house with a small yard in front. This house is located in Little Rock, Arkansas. Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton lived in this house when Bill was Arkansas Attorney General from 1977 to 1979.<br>\n Rodham and Clinton lived in this house in Little Rock’s Hillcrest neighborhood while he was Arkansas Attorney General (1977–1979).[94]<br>\n In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children’s Defense Fund.[46][95] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[96] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation,[97] and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981.[98] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[b] she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job.[99] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan’s attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[87]</p>\n <p>Following her husband’s November 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state’s First Lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve years (1979–81, 1983–92). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[100] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas’s poorest areas without affecting doctors’ fees.[101]</p>\n <p>In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm.[102] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[103] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[104] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[105] At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[104] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.</p>\n <p>On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to her only child, daughter Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[106]</p>\n <p>Later Arkansas years<br>\n The Reagans and the Clintons walking a red carpet during the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors<br>\n Governor Bill and First Lady Hillary Clinton attend the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors with President Ronald and First Lady Nancy Reagan.<br>\n Bill Clinton returned to the governor’s office two years later after winning the election of 1982. During her husband’s campaign, Hillary began to use the name “Hillary Clinton”, or sometimes “Mrs. Bill Clinton”, to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.[107] As First Lady of Arkansas again, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[c] She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state’s court-sanctioned public education system.[113][114] In one of the Clinton governorship’s most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[100][113] It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[82][113] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas’s Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[115] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[116][117]</p>\n <p>Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was First Lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours,[118] but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[119] The firm considered her a “rainmaker” because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[119] Bill Clinton’s Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest, because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[120]</p>\n <p>From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[121] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[122] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it.[123] She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 and in 1991.[124] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final time.[125]</p>\n <p>Formal color portrait of Clinton, 1992<br>\n Clinton in 1992<br>\n Clinton served as Chairman of the Board of the Children’s Defense Fund[5][126] and on the board of the Arkansas Children’s Hospital’s Legal Services (1988–92)[127] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–92),[128] Wal-Mart Stores (1986–92)[129] and Lafarge (1990–92).[130] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[119][131] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart’s board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[131] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be added to the company’s management and was silent about the company’s famously anti-labor union practices.[129][131][132]</p>\n <p>Bill Clinton presidential campaign of 1992<br>\n Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[133] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged “causing pain in my marriage”.[134] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[135] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette’s outlook on marriage as described in her classic song “Stand by Your Man”,[d] and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would “get two for the price of one”, referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[141] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg’s August 1992 The American Spectator article “The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock”, Hillary’s own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[92] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[142]</p>\n <p>First Lady of the United States</p>\n <p>When Bill Clinton took office as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press secretary reiterated that she would be using that form of her name.[c] She was the first inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[143] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[60][144] She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[145] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[146][147]</p>\n <p>Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton’s role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband’s presidency.[148] Bill Clinton’s campaign promise of “two for the price of one” led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as “co-presidents” or sometimes use the Arkansas label “Billary”.[100][149][150] The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into “imaginary discussions” with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt.[f] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.[154][155] Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner’s “politics of meaning” to overcome what she saw as America’s “sleeping sickness of the soul”; that would lead to a willingness “to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium.”[156][157]</p>\n <p>Health care and other policy initiatives<br>\n See also: Clinton health care plan of 1993</p>\n <p>Clinton at a presentation on her health care plan in September 1993<br>\n In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[158] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[159][160] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as “Hillarycare” and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress.[161] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[161]</p>\n <p>Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[162] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady’s approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44 percent in April 1994 and 35 percent by September 1994.[163]</p>\n <p>Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections.[164] Republicans saw a net gain of fifty-three seats in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats’ defeat, especially among independent voters.[165] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton’s role in shaping policy.[166] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use “Hillarycare” as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[167]</p>\n <p>Clinton reads a book to an African-American grade-schooler in Maryland during Read Across America Day in 1998<br>\n Clinton reads to a Maryland child during Read Across America Day, 1998<br>\n Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.[168] She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare.[169] She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.[60]</p>\n <p>Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton’s presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming off welfare, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.[170][171] A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again.[170] But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.[170][171] This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called “sad and painful”.[171]</p>\n <p>Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.[60] In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as first lady.[60][172] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care.[172] As first lady, Clinton was the host for various White House conferences, including ones on Child Care (1997),[173] on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997),[174] and on Children and Adolescents (2000).[175] She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000)[176] and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999).[177]</p>\n <p>Clinton traveled to 79 countries during this time,[178] breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon.[179] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[180] A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan.[181] Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps.[182] The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.[183]</p>\n <p>File:First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton’s Remarks to the Fourth Women’s Conference in Beijing, China.webmPlay media<br>\n Clinton delivering her “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights” speech in Beijing in September 1995 (20:19)<br>\n In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued very forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People’s Republic of China itself, declaring that “it is no longer acceptable to discuss women’s rights as separate from human rights”.[184] Delegates from over 180 countries heard her say: “If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights, once and for all.”[185] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[178][185] The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton’s key phrases.[186] She was one of the most prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[187][188] She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.[189] It and Clinton’s own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.[190]</p>\n <p>Whitewater and other investigations<br>\n For more details on these investigations, see Whitewater controversy, Travelgate, Filegate, and Hillary Clinton cattle futures controversy.<br>\n First Lady Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress and the press.</p>\n <p>The Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign[191] and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm[192] and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton’s work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed.[191] She said she had done minimal work for the bank.[193] Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton’s legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.[194][195] The records were found in the First Lady’s White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996.[195] The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been.[195] Clinton’s staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion.[196] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[194] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[197]</p>\n <p>Chelsea, Bill, and Hillary Clinton take an inauguration day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 1997, when Bill started a second term as President.<br>\n The Clintons take an Inauguration Day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to start Bill’s second term as President, January 20, 1997<br>\n Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an affair that became known as “Travelgate”, began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.[198] The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.[199][200] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made “factually false” statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false, or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.[201]</p>\n <p>In March 1994, newspaper reports revealed her spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978–79.[202] Allegations were made in the press of conflict of interest and disguised bribery and several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.[203]</p>\n <p>An outgrowth of the “Travelgate” investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called “Filegate”.[204] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and that she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[205] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[204]</p>\n <p>There was a controversy that arose in early 2001 over gifts made to the White House, rather than to the Clintons personally, that were removed and shipped to the Clintons’ private residence during the last year of Bill Clinton’s time in office.[206][207]</p>\n <p>Response to Lewinsky scandal<br>\n Further information: Lewinsky scandal<br>\n In 1998, the Clintons’ relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had engaged in an extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[208] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the President by the House of Representatives and later acquittal by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a “vast right-wing conspiracy”,[209][210] characterizing the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill’s political enemies[g] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said that she had been misled by her husband’s initial claims that no affair had taken place.[212] After the evidence of President Clinton’s encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage, but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage.[213] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.[214]</p>\n <p>Public reaction varied. Some women admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public, some sympathized with her as a victim of her husband’s insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an enabler to her husband’s indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.[215] Her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around 70 percent, the highest they had ever been.[215] In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to “a love that has persisted for decades” and add: “No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.”[216]</p>\n <p>Issues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills; in 2014, Hillary would state that she and Bill had left the White House “not only dead broke, but in debt.” The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who gave paid speeches after leaving office as well as the couple’s ability to secure loans from banks.[217]</p>\n <p>Traditional duties<br>\n Clinton initiated and was the founding chair of Save America’s Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations in order to preserve and restore historic items and sites,[218] including the flag that inspired “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the First Ladies Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[60] She was head of the White House Millennium Council[219] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[220] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[60] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned from museums.[221]</p>\n <p>In the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the state rooms.[60] She oversaw the restoration of the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe[222] and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II.[223] Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter.[224] These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines.[223] Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.[224] Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year’s Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[60]</p>\n <p>United States Senate</p>\n <p>Main article: United States Senate career of Hillary Clinton<br>\n 2000 U.S. Senate election<br>\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2000<br>\n When New York’s long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan’s open seat in the Senate election of 2000.[225] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.[226] She became the first First Lady of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.[227] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York’s 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state’s politics before the 2000 Senate race.[228]</p>\n <p>Clinton began her campaign, which was managed by Bill de Blasio, by visiting all 62 counties in the State, in a “listening tour” of small-group settings.[229] She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000 jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.[230]</p>\n <p>The contest drew national attention. Lazio blundered during a September debate by seeming to invade Clinton’s personal space trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.[231] The campaigns of Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani’s initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million.[232] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55 percent of the vote to Lazio’s 43 percent.[231] She was sworn in as U.S. Senator on January 3, 2001,[233] making her the first (and so far only) woman to have held an elected office either while,[h] or after, serving as first lady.</p>\n <p>First term<br>\n Clinton being sworn in as U.S. Senator by Vice President Al Gore in 2000.

Working with New York’s senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center site’s redevelopment.[241] She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.[242] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties,[243] before voting in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 in March 2006 that gained large majority support.[244]</p>\n <p>Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[245] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[246]</p>\n <p>After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[247] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain.[248] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush’s pledge to stay “until the job is done” was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis “an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves”.[249] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.[250] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York.[251][252] She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers.[252] (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying that she “got it wrong” and the vote in support had been a “mistake”.[253])</p>\n <p>Clinton voted against President Bush’s two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[254] Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[255][256]</p>\n <p>In 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[257] Along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[254][258]</p>\n <p>Looking to establish a “progressive infrastructure” to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration Chief of Staff John Podesta’s Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons’ former antagonist David Brock’s Media Matters for America, created in 2004.[259] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.[260]</p>\n <p>2006 re-election campaign<br>\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2006<br>\n In November 2004, Clinton announced that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[261] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance.[262] Clinton’s eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67 percent of the vote to Spencer’s 31 percent,[263] carrying all but four of New York’s sixty-two counties.[264] Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.[265] In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.[266]</p>\n <p>Second term<br>\n Clinton listens as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee.

A man wearing a black suit sits behind Clinton, taking notes.<br>\n Clinton listens as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee<br>\n Clinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging that the surge had been successful).[i] In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines[268] but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[269] Clinton responded to General David Petraeus’s September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, “I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.”[270]</p>\n <p>In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[271] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[272]</p>\n <p>As the financial crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700 billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying that it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74–25.[273]</p>\n <p>In 2007, Clinton and Virginia Senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[274]</p>\n <p>2008 presidential campaign</p>\n <p>Main articles: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008 and Hillary Clinton presidential primary campaign, 2008<br>\n Clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. President since at least early 2003.[275] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating “I’m in and I’m in to win.”[276] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency and no First Lady had ever run for President. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed that the couple’s worth was now upwards of $50 million,[277] and that they had earned over $100 million since 2000, with most of it coming from Bill’s books, speaking engagements and other activities.[278]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton addresses the 2007 CDA National Convention<br>\n Throughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[246] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[246] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[279] At the end of October, Clinton suffered a poor debate performance against Obama, Edwards and her other opponents.[280][281] Obama’s message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton’s message of experience.[282]</p>\n <p>Clinton speaking at a college rally as part of her 2008 Presidential campaign, with a crowd behind her looking on.

Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[288] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[j] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[289] Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[288][290] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[290] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February 5 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former President “needs to stop”.[291] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Hillary Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[292]</p>\n <p>Chart of 50 states, showing state-by-state popular votes in the Democratic primaries and caucuses, shaded by percentage won.

The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.[308]</p>\n <p>U.S. Secretary of State</p>\n <p>Main article: Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State<br>\n See also: Foreign policy of Barack Obama<br>\n Nomination and confirmation<br>\n Hillary Clinton taking oath as Secretary of State on January 21, 2009.

Both of them are holding a “reset button”. They are in a room with a window to the left and an American flag behind them<br>\n Clinton with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the “reset button”, March 2009<br>\n In an internal debate regarding the war in Afghanistan during 2009, Clinton sided with the military’s recommendations for a maximal “Afghanistan surge”, recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal; she prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden’s opposition, but eventually supported Obama’s compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.[252][325] In March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a “reset button” symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[326][327] The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev’s time in office, but relations would worsen considerably following Vladimir Putin’s return to the position in 2012.[326] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton’s intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish–Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[328][329] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[183][l] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country’s nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[310][331][332]</p>\n <p>Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president.[333][334] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[335] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[310] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[334] moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon.[336][337] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.[310]</p>\n <p>Clinton greeting U.S. military personnel at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.

Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[344][345][346] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution and the State Department’s legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution’s 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[347] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called “convening power” to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[345] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state,[348] and the wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[349][350][351]</p>\n <p>During April 2011 internal deliberations of the president’s innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[352][353] Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden’s death, Clinton played a key role in the administration’s decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[354] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).[252][355]</p>\n <p>Clinton standing with Aung San Suu Kyi.

Several of the attendees are sitting down, while others stand behind them. Everyone in the room is watching a live feed from drones operating over the Osama bin Laden complex.<br>\n Throughout her time in office and in her final speech concluding it, Clinton viewed “smart power” as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values—in a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities—by combining military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy.[345][370] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.[371] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[252][335][355] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[372]</p>\n <p>Clinton greatly expanded the State Department’s use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, both to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-à-vis their governments.[345] And in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[185] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the “Hillary Doctrine”, she viewed women’s rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[333][373] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.[374]</p>\n <p>Clinton visited 112 countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[375][n] (Time magazine wrote that “Clinton’s endurance is legendary”).[345] The first secretary of state to visit countries such as Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[378] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as Secretary of State should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[346] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton’s successor.[365] Her last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013.[379] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton’s tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other Secretaries of State had,[336][337] and highlighted her focus on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.[380]</p>\n <p>Benghazi attack and subsequent hearings<br>\n See also: 2012 Benghazi attack and United States House Select Committee on Benghazi<br>\n Obama and Clinton at a somber occasion, honoring the Benghazi attack victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony, held at Andrews Air Force Base on September 14, 2012.

Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[381] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[381][382]</p>\n <p>On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[383] It focused its criticism on the department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[384] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[383]</p>\n <p>Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[385] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate “talking points” after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, “With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.”[385][386] In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration’s response to the attack.[387]</p>\n <p>Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015. She is standing behind a podium with a microphone, with many people behind her.<br>\n Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015<br>\n The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack.[388] Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics.[388][389] This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton’s poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans’ previous talking points on the investigation.[388][390] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[391][392] The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves.[391] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[393] The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines,[388] with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.[389]</p>\n <p>Email controversy<br>\n Main article: Hillary Clinton email controversy<br>\n A controversy arose in March 2015, when it was revealed by the State Department’s inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton’s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[394][395]</p>\n <p>In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and “never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.” They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[396] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[397] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called “born classified” category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[398] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton’s server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[399] Additionally, the intelligence community’s inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails “contained classified State Department information when originated.”[400] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[401]</p>\n <p>Clinton maintained that she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, “I never sent or received any classified material – they are retroactively classifying it.” On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: “Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.”[402][403]</p>\n <p>On July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said:</p>\n <p>110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were “up-classified” to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[399][404]</p>\n <p>Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small “c” in parentheses, described as “portion markings” by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not “technically sophisticated” enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.[404] The probe found that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI assessed that it “is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account.” Comey stated that although Clinton or her colleagues were “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information”, the FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that “no charges are appropriate in this case.”[399] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed that the probe into Clinton’s use of private email servers while secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges.[405]</p>\n <p>On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI started looking into newly discovered emails. Law enforcement officials stated while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered e-mails related to Clinton’s private server on a laptop computer belonging to Anthony Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its conclusion reached in July.[406] The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election.[407]</p>\n <p>Clinton Foundation and speeches</p>\n <p>Main article: Clinton Foundation<br>\n Clinton standing behind lectern<br>\n Clinton in September 2014<br>\n When Clinton left the State Department, she became a private citizen for the first time in thirty years.[408] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[409] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[409][410]</p>\n <p>Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[411] its March 2015 report said that while “There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman … this data shows just how far we still have to go.”[412] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary.[o] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[415]</p>\n <p>She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[416] There she received $200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[416][417] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[416] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11 million from her speeches.[418] For the overall period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141 million, paid some $56 million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15 million to charity.[419] As of 2015, she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her own, or $45–53 million with her husband.[420]</p>\n <p>Clinton resigned from the foundation’s board in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign and the foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[o]</p>\n <p>2016 presidential campaign</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton campaigning for president in Manchester, New Hampshire, in October 2016, with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (seated)<br>\n Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016<br>\n Further information: United States presidential election, 2016; Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016; and Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016<br>\n On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[421] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure.[422] The campaign’s headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[423] Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act.[424][425] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[421] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton’s Wall Street ties.[417][425]</p>\n <p>In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders,[426][427] making her the first woman to win the Iowa caucuses.[426] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[428] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[429] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[430] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[429] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[429]</p>\n <p>On March 1 (“Super Tuesday”), Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[431] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[432][433][434]</p>\n <p>By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[435] On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[436] By campaign’s end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders’ 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders’ 47.[437] She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders’ 13 million.[438]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Bernie Sanders endorsing Clinton in New Hampshire, July 2016<br>\n Clinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.[439] Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following day.[440] Her opponents in the general election were Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party.</p>\n <p>Clinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton became tied in major polls following the FBI’s conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[441] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her handling of classified government material.[442] In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention, in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it is toward the small side by historical standards.[443][444] Following Clinton’s 7 percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[445][446]</p>\n <p>Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016 presidential election.[447] By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win and media sources proclaimed him the winner.[448] Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave a victory speech.[449] The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying “We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.”[450] Though Clinton lost the election by only capturing 232 electors to Trump’s 306, a month after the election the popular vote count showed her leading by more than 2.7 million votes, with many votes yet to be counted.[451] She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.[452][453]</p>\n <p>On December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes instead being cast for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.[454]</p>\n <p>Clinton speaking behind a podium with a microphone in her hand.

Making reference to reports of her being seen taking walks in woods around Chappaqua following her loss in the presidential election,[456][457] Clinton indicated her readiness to emerge from “the woods” and become politically active again.[456]</p>\n <p>In April 2017, Clinton commented that she will not seek public office again.[458]</p>\n <p>Clinton revealed Onward Together, a new political action committee that she wrote as being “dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election”, in a several tweets and an email in May 2017.[459]</p>\n <p>In a June 5, 2017 appearance at the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel, Clinton condemned the 2017 Portland train attack: “When violence motivated by hatred from, Portland, Oregon, to College Park, ends the lives of young Americans, this program’s mission of spreading tolerance is more urgent than ever.”[460] On June 14, after the Congressional baseball shooting, Clinton tweeted, “2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we’re all ultimately on one team. My thoughts are with the members of Congress, staff &amp; heroic police.”[461]</p>\n <p>Comments on President Trump<br>\n On February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indians by Adam Purinton.[462] On April 6, in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Clinton said the US should take out the air fields of Bashar al-Assad and thereby “prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.”[463] On May 2, Clinton said Trump’s use of Twitter “doesn’t work” when pursuing important negotiations and North Korea should not be consulted with an abandoning “of a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table with some kind of realistic prospect for change.”[464] While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump’s 2018 budget proposal was “a con” for underfunding domestic programs.[465] During an appearance at Recode’s Code Conference on May 31, Clinton suggested Trump’s incomplete tweet from earlier in the day was “a hidden message to the Russians.”[466] The following day, after President Trump announced withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a “historic mistake.”[467]</p>\n <p>On March 24, 2017, after the postponing of a Congressional vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Clinton labeled the day “a victory for the 24,000,000 people at risk of losing their health insurance” and warned of an ongoing battle to maintain coverage.[468] Clinton went on to call the American Health Care Act “a disastrous bill” during a San Francisco speech four days later.[469] May 4, after the House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act, Clinton dubbed it a “shameful failure of policy &amp; morality by GOP”.[470] On June 23, the day after Senate Republicans revealed a draft of their healthcare reform legislation, Clinton tweeted, “This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics.

Clinton is in favor of maintaining U.S. influence in the Middle East.<br>\n Several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton’s place on the political spectrum scientifically using her Senate votes. National Journal’s 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[472] National Journal’s subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[473] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her to be likely the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[474] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75 liberal, 23 conservative; Social = 83 liberal, 6 conservative; Foreign = 66 liberal, 30 conservative. Total average = 75 liberal, 20 conservative.[p] According to FiveThirtyEight’s measure of political ideology, “Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.”[475]</p>\n <p>Organizations have also attempted to give newer assessments of Clinton once she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in their “Left Liberal” region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances and an economic score of 10 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[476] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[477] Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90 percent “Liberal Quotient” from Americans for Democratic Action,[478] and a lifetime 8 percent rating from the American Conservative Union.[479]</p>\n <p>In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called “optimistic” and “wide-ranging”. Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a “clawback” that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an “exit tax” on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[480] Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as “the gold standard”[481] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that “any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security”.[482][483] As Senator (2001–2009), her record on trade was mixed, voting in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[482]</p>\n <p>Given the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit “unaccountable money” in politics.[484] In July 2016, she “committed” to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.[485][486] On December 7, 2015, in The New York Times, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities.[487]</p>\n <p>Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign logo, a large blue letter “H” with a red arrow facing right, overlaying the horizontal bar of the “H”.

It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn’t politicized…. Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven’t had that and so don’t understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.”[503]</p>\n <p>On foreign affairs, Clinton voted in October 2002 in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq,[504] a vote she later “regretted.”[505] She favored arming Syria’s rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[506] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[507][508] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[501] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, “America can’t ever be neutral when it comes to Israel’s security and survival.”[509] Clinton expressed support for Israel’s right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[510][511] In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields.[512]</p>\n <p>In 2000, Clinton advocated for eliminating the electoral college[513] and promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it resulting in the direct election of the president.[514][515]</p>\n <p>Religious views</p>\n <p>Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church:</p>\n <p>First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge, Illinois—in her early life,<br>\n First United Methodist Church of Little Rock, Arkansas—while in Arkansas,<br>\n Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C.—as First Lady of the United States,<br>\n Metropolitan Community United Methodist Church in New York, New York—currently a congregant.<br>\n She discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.[516] However, she has infrequently discussed her faith while campaigning.[517][518] Clinton has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one’s neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and “creating opportunities for others to be lifted up”.[518] Clinton has also expressed disappointment that “Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.”[518]</p>\n <p>Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has suggested that Clinton’s political positions are rooted in her faith. Clinton often expresses a certain maxim which is often attributed to John Wesley: “Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.”[517] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy “made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith.”[519]</p>\n <p>Writings and recordings</p>\n <p>See also: Bibliography of Hillary Clinton<br>\n External video<br>\n Booknotes interview with Clinton about It Takes a Village, March 3, 1996, C-SPAN<br>\n Informal pose of Clinton, in which she is wearing a beige wool jacket and facing toward the right.

The book made the Best Seller list of The New York Times and Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book’s audio recording.[522] She was the first First Lady to win a Grammy Award.[523]</p>\n <p>Other books published by Clinton when she was first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids’ Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children’s book Beatrice’s Goat.[524]</p>\n <p>In 2003, Clinton released a 562-page autobiography, Living History, for which publisher Simon &amp; Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8 million.[525] The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[526] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[527] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[528] Clinton’s audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[529]</p>\n <p>In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as Secretary of State. As of July 2015, the book has sold about 280,000 copies.[530]</p>\n <p>In 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States if they had won the 2016 presidential election.[531]</p>\n <p>Clinton authored her third memoir, What Happened, about the 2016 election, which was released on September 12, 2017, by Simon &amp; Schuster, in print, e-book, and audio read by the author.[532] A book tour and series of interviews and personal appearances were arranged for the launch.[533]</p>\n <p>Cultural and political image</p>\n <p>Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton, from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found “a virtual cottage industry” of “anti-Clinton literature”, put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints, with titles such as Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary’s Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton’s Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless … Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[534] (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[535] Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable “bogeyman” to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[536]</p>\n <p>Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture from a wide spectrum of varying perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[537] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, “Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.”[538] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as first lady and has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers.[539][540] Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her, including but not limited to “The Hillary Shimmy Song”, which went viral.[541][542][543][544]</p>\n <p>A three-story, red brick building in Arkansas.

Her professional career and political involvement set the stage for public reaction to her as first lady.<br>\n Clinton has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, with some arguing otherwise.[545] James Madison University political science professor Valerie Sulfaro’s 2007 study used the American National Election Studies’ “feeling thermometer” polls, which measure the degree of opinion about a political figure, to find that such polls during Clinton’s first lady years confirm the “conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure”, with the added insight that “affect towards Mrs. Clinton as first lady tended to be very positive or very negative, with a fairly constant one fourth of respondents feeling ambivalent or neutral”.[546] University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson’s 2006 study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state’s senators, Clinton had the fourth-largest partisan difference of any senator, with a 50-percentage-point difference in approval between New York’s Democrats and Republicans.[547]</p>\n <p>Northern Illinois University political science professor Barbara Burrell’s 2000 study found that Clinton’s Gallup poll favorability numbers broke sharply along partisan lines throughout her time as first lady, with 70 to 90 percent of Democrats typically viewing her favorably while only 20 to 40 percent of Republicans did.[548] University of Wisconsin–Madison political science professor Charles Franklin analyzed her record of favorable versus unfavorable ratings in public opinion polls and found that there was more variation in them during her first lady years than her Senate years. The Senate years showed favorable ratings around 50 percent and unfavorable ratings in the mid-40 percent range; Franklin noted that, “This sharp split is, of course, one of the more widely remarked aspects of Sen. Clinton’s public image.”[549] McGill University professor of history Gil Troy titled his 2006 biography of her Hillary Rodham Clinton: Polarizing First Lady and wrote that after the 1992 campaign, Clinton “was a polarizing figure, with 42 percent [of the public] saying she came closer to their values and lifestyle than previous first ladies and 41 percent disagreeing.”[550] Troy further wrote that Clinton “has been uniquely controversial and contradictory since she first appeared on the national radar screen in 1992” and that she “has alternately fascinated, bedeviled, bewitched and appalled Americans.”[551]</p>\n <p>Line chart showing Clinton’s favorability rankings from 1992 to 2016.

She is speaking into a microphone.<br>\n Clinton in 2009<br>\n Going into the early stages of her presidential campaign for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled “Love Her”, “Hate Her”,[557] while Mother Jones titled its profile of her “Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary”.[558] Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates,[559] while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all.[560][561] An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled “The Waning Power of Hillary Hate”.[562] By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation.[563] She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton’s laugh,[564] that “We know that there’s language to condemn female speech that doesn’t exist for male speech. We call women’s speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton’s laugh was being described as a cackle.”[563] The “bitch” epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics,[565] flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well.[566] Following Clinton’s “choked up moment” and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender’s role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[567][568] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events “brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades … she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics.”[568]</p>\n <p>Hillary Clinton dressed in a black suit and a green shirt, sitting in a café.

It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics.[572] Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, “There’s a certain consistency to who I am and what I do and I think people have finally said, ‘Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'”[333] She continued to do well in Gallup’s most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.[573]</p>\n <p>Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[574] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[575] During 2016 she acknowledged that: “I’m not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed.”[576] In July 2017 Bloomberg showed her approval rating at 39 percent.[577]</p>\n <p>Electoral history</p>\n <p>Main article: Electoral history of Hillary Clinton<br>\n New York United States Senate election, 2000<br>\n Party Candidate Votes % ±<br>\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 3,747,310 55.3<br>\n Republican Rick Lazio 2,915,730 43.0<br>\n New York United States Senate election, 2006<br>\n Party Candidate Votes % ±<br>\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 3,008,428 67.0 +11.7<br>\n Republican John Spencer 1,392,189 31.0 −12.0<br>\n Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008<br>\n Party Candidate Votes %<br>\n Democratic Barack Obama 17,584,692 (popular votes)<br>\n 2,272.5 delegates<br>\n (33 states) 47.3% of popular vote<br>\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 17,857,501 (popular votes)<br>\n 1,978 delegates<br>\n (23 states) 48.0% of popular vote<br>\n Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016<br>\n Party Candidate Votes %<br>\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 16,914,722 (popular votes)<br>\n 2,842 delegates<br>\n (34 states) 55.2% of popular vote<br>\n Democratic Bernie Sanders 13,206,428 (popular votes)<br>\n 1,865 delegates<br>\n (23 states) 43.1% of popular vote<br>\n United States presidential election, 2016<br>\n Party Candidate Votes %<br>\n Republican Donald Trump 62,979,879 (popular votes)<br>\n 304 electors<br>\n (30 states + ME-02) 46.0% (popular vote)<br>\n 56.5% (electoral vote)<br>\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 65,844,954 (popular votes)<br>\n 227 electors<br>\n (20 states + DC) 48.1% (popular vote)<br>\n 42.2% (electoral vote)</p>\n <p>Early life<br>\n Museum display case containing photographs, papers, shoes, doll, and other early childhood artifacts of Hillary Rodham’s early life<br>\n Mementos of Hillary Rodham’s early life are shown at the William J. Clinton Presidential Center<br>\n Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.[5][6] Clinton was raised in a United Methodist family that first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge.[7] Her father, Hugh Rodham (1911–1993), was of English and Welsh descent,[8] and managed a small but successful textile business.[9] Her mother, Dorothy Howell (1919–2011), was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent.[8][10][11] Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.[12]</p>\n <p>As a child, Rodham was a favorite student of her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge.[13] She participated in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout.[13] She has often told a story[14][15][16] of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.[17] She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society.[5][18] She was elected class vice president for her junior year, but then lost for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that “you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president”.[19] For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted “most likely to succeed”. She graduated in her class’s top five percent in 1965.[20]</p>\n <p>Rodham’s mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career,[11] and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter’s abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.[21] Raised in a politically conservative household,[11] Rodham helped canvass Chicago’s South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon.[22] She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964.[23] Rodham’s early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater’s The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago’s Orchestra Hall.[24]</p>\n <p>Wellesley College years<br>\n In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science.[25][26] During her freshman year, she served as president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.[27][28] As the leader of this “Rockefeller Republican”-oriented group,[29] she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to Mayor of New York City and Massachusetts Attorney General Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.[30] She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the American Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years.[27] In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as “a mind conservative and a heart liberal”.[31] In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.[32][33]</p>\n <p>By her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy.[34] In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969.[32][35] Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley’s black students to recruit more black students and faculty.[34] In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.[32][36] A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.[32]</p>\n <p>To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference and she attended the “Wellesley in Washington” summer program.[34] Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.[34] Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon’s campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention’s “veiled” racist messages and left the Republican Party for good.[34] Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter.[37] (Years later, while she was first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.[37])</p>\n <p>In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts,[38] with departmental honors in political science.[37] After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke.[35][39] After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes.[32][40][41] She was featured in an article published in Life magazine,[42][43] due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke.[39] She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet’s nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.[44] That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).[45]</p>\n <p>Yale Law School and postgraduate studies<br>\n Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she served on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action.[46] During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center,[47] learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).[48][49] She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital[48] and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.[47] In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman’s Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale’s Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers’ issues including education, health and housing.[50] Edelman later became a significant mentor.[51] Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.[52]</p>\n <p>In the late spring of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, who was also a law student at Yale. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members);[53] Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.[a] Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California;[57] the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[54] The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern.[58] She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973,[38] having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton.[59] He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.[59]</p>\n <p>Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center.[60] In late 1973 her first scholarly article, “Children Under the Law”, was published in the Harvard Educational Review.[61] Discussing the new children’s rights movement, the article stated that “child citizens” were “powerless individuals”[62] and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis.[63] The article became frequently cited in the field.[64]</p>\n <p>Marriage, family, law career and First Lady of Arkansas</p>\n <p>From the East Coast to Arkansas<br>\n During her postgraduate study, Rodham served as staff attorney for Edelman’s newly founded Children’s Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[65] and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.[66] In 1974 she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., advising the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal.[67] Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum,[48] Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for impeachment.[67] The committee’s work culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.[67]</p>\n <p>By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham’s career.[68] Wright thought she had the potential to become a future senator or president.[69] Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him and she continued to demur.[70] After failing the District of Columbia bar exam[71] and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, “I chose to follow my heart instead of my head”.[72] She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.[73][74]</p>\n <p>Early Arkansas years<br>\n At the university, Rodham gave classes in criminal law, where she was considered to be a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.[75] She became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.[76] In one of her cases, she was mandated by the court to serve as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl. Clinton used an effective defense that led her client to plead guilty to a much lesser charge. Decades later, the victim said that the defense counsel had put her “through hell” during the legal process; Hillary Clinton has called the trial a “terrible case”.[77] During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city’s first rape crisis center.[76] Rodham still harbored doubts about marriage, concerned that her separate identity would be lost and her accomplishments viewed in the light of someone else’s.[78]</p>\n <p>Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she finally agreed to marry him.[79] Their wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room.[80] A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she was retaining the name Hillary Rodham.[81][82] The motivation was to keep the couple’s professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because, as she told a friend at the time, “it showed that I was still me.”[83] The decision upset both of their more traditional mothers.[84] Clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974, but in November 1976 was elected Arkansas Attorney General and so the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock.[85] There, in February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.[86] She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law[46] while also working pro bono in child advocacy;[87] she rarely performed litigation work in court.[88]</p>\n <p>Rodham maintained her interest in children’s law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles “Children’s Policies: Abandonment and Neglect” in 1977[89] and “Children’s Rights: A Legal Perspective” in 1979.[90] The latter continued her argument that children’s legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, “Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.”[63] Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as “one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades”,[91] while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority,[92] would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents,[63] and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.[93]</p>\n <p>A small, one-story brick-faced house with a small yard in front. This house is located in Little Rock, Arkansas. Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton lived in this house when Bill was Arkansas Attorney General from 1977 to 1979.<br>\n Rodham and Clinton lived in this house in Little Rock’s Hillcrest neighborhood while he was Arkansas Attorney General (1977–1979).[94]<br>\n In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children’s Defense Fund.[46][95] Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana)[96] appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation,[97] and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981.[98] From mid-1978 to mid-1980,[b] she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job.[99] During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan’s attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization.[87]</p>\n <p>Following her husband’s November 1978 election as Governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state’s First Lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve years (1979–81, 1983–92). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year,[100] where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas’s poorest areas without affecting doctors’ fees.[101]</p>\n <p>In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm.[102] From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband.[103] During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts;[104] an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months.[105] At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal.[104] Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.</p>\n <p>On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to her only child, daughter Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election.[106]</p>\n <p>Later Arkansas years<br>\n The Reagans and the Clintons walking a red carpet during the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors<br>\n Governor Bill and First Lady Hillary Clinton attend the 1987 Dinner Honoring the Nation’s Governors with President Ronald and First Lady Nancy Reagan.<br>\n Bill Clinton returned to the governor’s office two years later after winning the election of 1982. During her husband’s campaign, Hillary began to use the name “Hillary Clinton”, or sometimes “Mrs. Bill Clinton”, to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time.[107] As First Lady of Arkansas again, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name.[c] She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state’s court-sanctioned public education system.[113][114] In one of the Clinton governorship’s most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size.[100][113] It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort.[82][113] In 1985, she introduced Arkansas’s Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy.[115] She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.[116][117]</p>\n <p>Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was First Lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours,[118] but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there.[119] The firm considered her a “rainmaker” because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges.[119] Bill Clinton’s Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest, because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated.[120]</p>\n <p>From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation,[121] which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.[122] From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it.[123] She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 and in 1991.[124] When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final time.[125]</p>\n <p>Formal color portrait of Clinton, 1992<br>\n Clinton in 1992<br>\n Clinton served as Chairman of the Board of the Children’s Defense Fund[5][126] and on the board of the Arkansas Children’s Hospital’s Legal Services (1988–92)[127] In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–92),[128] Wal-Mart Stores (1986–92)[129] and Lafarge (1990–92).[130] TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law.[119][131] Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart’s board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it.[131] Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, was largely unsuccessful in a campaign for more women to be added to the company’s management and was silent about the company’s famously anti-labor union practices.[129][131][132]</p>\n <p>Bill Clinton presidential campaign of 1992<br>\n Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.[133] In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged “causing pain in my marriage”.[134] This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.[135] During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette’s outlook on marriage as described in her classic song “Stand by Your Man”,[d] and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead.[e] The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would “get two for the price of one”, referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.[141] Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg’s August 1992 The American Spectator article “The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock”, Hillary’s own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives.[92] At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.[142]</p>\n <p>First Lady of the United States</p>\n <p>When Bill Clinton took office as President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press secretary reiterated that she would be using that form of her name.[c] She was the first inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House.[143] She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.[60][144] She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.[145] After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.[146][147]</p>\n <p>Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton’s role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husband’s presidency.[148] Bill Clinton’s campaign promise of “two for the price of one” led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as “co-presidents” or sometimes use the Arkansas label “Billary”.[100][149][150] The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into “imaginary discussions” with the also-politically-active Eleanor Roosevelt.[f] From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures.[154][155] Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner’s “politics of meaning” to overcome what she saw as America’s “sleeping sickness of the soul”; that would lead to a willingness “to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium.”[156][157]</p>\n <p>Health care and other policy initiatives<br>\n See also: Clinton health care plan of 1993</p>\n <p>Clinton at a presentation on her health care plan in September 1993<br>\n In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform.[158] Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority.[159][160] The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as “Hillarycare” and it faced opposition from even some Democrats in Congress.[161] Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.[161]</p>\n <p>Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.[162] Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady’s approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44 percent in April 1994 and 35 percent by September 1994.[163]</p>\n <p>Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections.[164] Republicans saw a net gain of fifty-three seats in the House election and seven in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats’ defeat, especially among independent voters.[165] The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton’s role in shaping policy.[166] Opponents of universal health care would continue to use “Hillarycare” as a pejorative label for similar plans by others.[167]</p>\n <p>Clinton reads a book to an African-American grade-schooler in Maryland during Read Across America Day in 1998<br>\n Clinton reads to a Maryland child during Read Across America Day, 1998<br>\n Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law.[168] She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare.[169] She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.[60]</p>\n <p>Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton’s presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming off welfare, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did.[170][171] A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again.[170] But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available.[170][171] This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called “sad and painful”.[171]</p>\n <p>Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice.[60] In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as first lady.[60][172] In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care.[172] As first lady, Clinton was the host for various White House conferences, including ones on Child Care (1997),[173] on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997),[174] and on Children and Adolescents (2000).[175] She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000)[176] and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999).[177]</p>\n <p>Clinton traveled to 79 countries during this time,[178] breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon.[179] She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives.[180] A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan.[181] Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps.[182] The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.[183]</p>\n <p>File:First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton’s Remarks to the Fourth Women’s Conference in Beijing, China.webmPlay media<br>\n Clinton delivering her “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights” speech in Beijing in September 1995 (20:19)<br>\n In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued very forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People’s Republic of China itself, declaring that “it is no longer acceptable to discuss women’s rights as separate from human rights”.[184] Delegates from over 180 countries heard her say: “If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights, once and for all.”[185] In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks.[178][185] The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton’s key phrases.[186] She was one of the most prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban.[187][188] She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.[189] It and Clinton’s own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process.[190]</p>\n <p>Whitewater and other investigations<br>\n For more details on these investigations, see Whitewater controversy, Travelgate, Filegate, and Hillary Clinton cattle futures controversy.<br>\n First Lady Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress and the press.</p>\n <p>The Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign[191] and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm[192] and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton’s work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed.[191] She said she had done minimal work for the bank.[193] Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton’s legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were.[194][195] The records were found in the First Lady’s White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996.[195] The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been.[195] Clinton’s staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion.[196] On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury.[194] After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.[197]</p>\n <p>Chelsea, Bill, and Hillary Clinton take an inauguration day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 1997, when Bill started a second term as President.<br>\n The Clintons take an Inauguration Day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to start Bill’s second term as President, January 20, 1997<br>\n Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an affair that became known as “Travelgate”, began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.[198] The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.[199][200] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made “factually false” statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false, or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.[201]</p>\n <p>In March 1994, newspaper reports revealed her spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978–79.[202] Allegations were made in the press of conflict of interest and disguised bribery and several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing.[203]</p>\n <p>An outgrowth of the “Travelgate” investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called “Filegate”.[204] Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and that she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.[205] The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.[204]</p>\n <p>There was a controversy that arose in early 2001 over gifts made to the White House, rather than to the Clintons personally, that were removed and shipped to the Clintons’ private residence during the last year of Bill Clinton’s time in office.[206][207]</p>\n <p>Response to Lewinsky scandal<br>\n Further information: Lewinsky scandal<br>\n In 1998, the Clintons’ relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had engaged in an extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[208] Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the President by the House of Representatives and later acquittal by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a “vast right-wing conspiracy”,[209][210] characterizing the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill’s political enemies[g] rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said that she had been misled by her husband’s initial claims that no affair had taken place.[212] After the evidence of President Clinton’s encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage, but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage.[213] The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.[214]</p>\n <p>Public reaction varied. Some women admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public, some sympathized with her as a victim of her husband’s insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an enabler to her husband’s indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.[215] Her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around 70 percent, the highest they had ever been.[215] In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to “a love that has persisted for decades” and add: “No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.”[216]</p>\n <p>Issues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills; in 2014, Hillary would state that she and Bill had left the White House “not only dead broke, but in debt.” The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who gave paid speeches after leaving office as well as the couple’s ability to secure loans from banks.[217]</p>\n <p>Traditional duties<br>\n Clinton initiated and was the founding chair of Save America’s Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations in order to preserve and restore historic items and sites,[218] including the flag that inspired “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the First Ladies Historic Site in Canton, Ohio.[60] She was head of the White House Millennium Council[219] and hosted Millennium Evenings,[220] a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House.[60] Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned from museums.[221]</p>\n <p>In the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the state rooms.[60] She oversaw the restoration of the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe[222] and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II.[223] Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter.[224] These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines.[223] Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.[224] Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year’s Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.[60]</p>\n <p>United States Senate</p>\n <p>Main article: United States Senate career of Hillary Clinton<br>\n 2000 U.S. Senate election<br>\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2000<br>\n When New York’s long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan’s open seat in the Senate election of 2000.[225] Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999.[226] She became the first First Lady of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.[227] Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York’s 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state’s politics before the 2000 Senate race.[228]</p>\n <p>Clinton began her campaign, which was managed by Bill de Blasio, by visiting all 62 counties in the State, in a “listening tour” of small-group settings.[229] She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000 jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.[230]</p>\n <p>The contest drew national attention. Lazio blundered during a September debate by seeming to invade Clinton’s personal space trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement.[231] The campaigns of Clinton and Lazio, along with Giuliani’s initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million.[232] Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55 percent of the vote to Lazio’s 43 percent.[231] She was sworn in as U.S. Senator on January 3, 2001,[233] making her the first (and so far only) woman to have held an elected office either while,[h] or after, serving as first lady.</p>\n <p>First term<br>\n Clinton being sworn in as U.S. Senator by Vice President Al Gore in 2000.

Working with New York’s senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center site’s redevelopment.[241] She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders.[242] Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties,[243] before voting in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 in March 2006 that gained large majority support.[244]</p>\n <p>Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government.[245] Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.[246]</p>\n <p>After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well.[247] Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain.[248] In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush’s pledge to stay “until the job is done” was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis “an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves”.[249] Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.[250] Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York.[251][252] She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers.[252] (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying that she “got it wrong” and the vote in support had been a “mistake”.[253])</p>\n <p>Clinton voted against President Bush’s two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.[254] Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter.[255][256]</p>\n <p>In 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[257] Along with Senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage.[254][258]</p>\n <p>Looking to establish a “progressive infrastructure” to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration Chief of Staff John Podesta’s Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons’ former antagonist David Brock’s Media Matters for America, created in 2004.[259] Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging.[260]</p>\n <p>2006 re-election campaign<br>\n Main article: United States Senate election in New York, 2006<br>\n In November 2004, Clinton announced that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini.[261] The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance.[262] Clinton’s eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67 percent of the vote to Spencer’s 31 percent,[263] carrying all but four of New York’s sixty-two counties.[264] Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008.[265] In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.[266]</p>\n <p>Second term<br>\n Clinton listens as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee.

In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it.[269] Clinton responded to General David Petraeus’s September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, “I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.”[270]</p>\n <p>In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.[271] Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture.[272]</p>\n <p>As the financial crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700 billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying that it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74–25.[273]</p>\n <p>In 2007, Clinton and Virginia Senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate.[274]</p>\n <p>2008 presidential campaign</p>\n <p>Main articles: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008 and Hillary Clinton presidential primary campaign, 2008<br>\n Clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. President since at least early 2003.[275] On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating “I’m in and I’m in to win.”[276] No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency and no First Lady had ever run for President. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed that the couple’s worth was now upwards of $50 million,[277] and that they had earned over $100 million since 2000, with most of it coming from Bill’s books, speaking engagements and other activities.[278]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton addresses the 2007 CDA National Convention<br>\n Throughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors.[246] The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning.[246] Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.[279] At the end of October, Clinton suffered a poor debate performance against Obama, Edwards and her other opponents.[280][281] Obama’s message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton’s message of experience.[282]</p>\n <p>Clinton speaking at a college rally as part of her 2008 Presidential campaign, with a crowd behind her looking on.

Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates,[288] and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson,[j] were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign.[289] Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.[288][290] She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26 South Carolina primary,[290] setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February 5 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former President “needs to stop”.[291] The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Hillary Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.[292]</p>\n <p>Chart of 50 states, showing state-by-state popular votes in the Democratic primaries and caucuses, shaded by percentage won.

The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.[308]</p>\n <p>U.S. Secretary of State</p>\n <p>Main article: Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State<br>\n See also: Foreign policy of Barack Obama<br>\n Nomination and confirmation<br>\n Hillary Clinton taking oath as Secretary of State on January 21, 2009.

Both of them are holding a “reset button”. They are in a room with a window to the left and an American flag behind them<br>\n Clinton with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the “reset button”, March 2009<br>\n In an internal debate regarding the war in Afghanistan during 2009, Clinton sided with the military’s recommendations for a maximal “Afghanistan surge”, recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal; she prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden’s opposition, but eventually supported Obama’s compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.[252][325] In March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a “reset button” symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.[326][327] The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev’s time in office, but relations would worsen considerably following Vladimir Putin’s return to the position in 2012.[326] In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton’s intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish–Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.[328][329] In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S.[183][l] Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country’s nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.[310][331][332]</p>\n <p>Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president.[333][334] Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.[335] Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.[310] She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents;[334] moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon.[336][337] Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.[310]</p>\n <p>Clinton greeting U.S. military personnel at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.

Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[344][345][346] Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution and the State Department’s legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution’s 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration).[347] Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called “convening power” to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.[345] The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state,[348] and the wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.[349][350][351]</p>\n <p>During April 2011 internal deliberations of the president’s innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.[352][353] Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden’s death, Clinton played a key role in the administration’s decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader.[354] During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).[252][355]</p>\n <p>Clinton standing with Aung San Suu Kyi.

Several of the attendees are sitting down, while others stand behind them. Everyone in the room is watching a live feed from drones operating over the Osama bin Laden complex.<br>\n Throughout her time in office and in her final speech concluding it, Clinton viewed “smart power” as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values—in a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities—by combining military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy.[345][370] As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.[371] In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration.[252][335][355] In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action.[372]</p>\n <p>Clinton greatly expanded the State Department’s use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, both to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-à-vis their governments.[345] And in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.[185] Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the “Hillary Doctrine”, she viewed women’s rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.[333][373] In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.[374]</p>\n <p>Clinton visited 112 countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state[375][n] (Time magazine wrote that “Clinton’s endurance is legendary”).[345] The first secretary of state to visit countries such as Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age.[378] As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as Secretary of State should Obama be re-elected in 2012;[346] in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton’s successor.[365] Her last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013.[379] Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton’s tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other Secretaries of State had,[336][337] and highlighted her focus on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.[380]</p>\n <p>Benghazi attack and subsequent hearings<br>\n See also: 2012 Benghazi attack and United States House Select Committee on Benghazi<br>\n Obama and Clinton at a somber occasion, honoring the Benghazi attack victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony, held at Andrews Air Force Base on September 14, 2012.

Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S.[381] On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.[381][382]</p>\n <p>On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.[383] It focused its criticism on the department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.[384] Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.[383]</p>\n <p>Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.[385] Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate “talking points” after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, “With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.”[385][386] In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration’s response to the attack.[387]</p>\n <p>Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015. She is standing behind a podium with a microphone, with many people behind her.<br>\n Clinton testifying before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015<br>\n The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack.[388] Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics.[388][389] This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton’s poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans’ previous talking points on the investigation.[388][390] On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee.[391][392] The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves.[391] Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.[393] The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines,[388] with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.[389]</p>\n <p>Email controversy<br>\n Main article: Hillary Clinton email controversy<br>\n A controversy arose in March 2015, when it was revealed by the State Department’s inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton’s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.[394][395]</p>\n <p>In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and “never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.” They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house.[396] Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such.[397] After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called “born classified” category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.[398] The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton’s server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department.[399] Additionally, the intelligence community’s inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails “contained classified State Department information when originated.”[400] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.[401]</p>\n <p>Clinton maintained that she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, “I never sent or received any classified material – they are retroactively classifying it.” On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: “Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.”[402][403]</p>\n <p>On July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said:</p>\n <p>110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were “up-classified” to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.[399][404]</p>\n <p>Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small “c” in parentheses, described as “portion markings” by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not “technically sophisticated” enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.[404] The probe found that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI assessed that it “is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account.” Comey stated that although Clinton or her colleagues were “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information”, the FBI would recommend to the Justice Department that “no charges are appropriate in this case.”[399] On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch confirmed that the probe into Clinton’s use of private email servers while secretary of state will be closed without criminal charges.[405]</p>\n <p>On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI started looking into newly discovered emails. Law enforcement officials stated while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered e-mails related to Clinton’s private server on a laptop computer belonging to Anthony Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its conclusion reached in July.[406] The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election.[407]</p>\n <p>Clinton Foundation and speeches</p>\n <p>Main article: Clinton Foundation<br>\n Clinton standing behind lectern<br>\n Clinton in September 2014<br>\n When Clinton left the State Department, she became a private citizen for the first time in thirty years.[408] She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.[409] There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.[409][410]</p>\n <p>Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995;[411] its March 2015 report said that while “There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman … this data shows just how far we still have to go.”[412] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary.[o] However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.[415]</p>\n <p>She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit.[416] There she received $200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions.[416][417] She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation.[416] For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11 million from her speeches.[418] For the overall period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141 million, paid some $56 million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15 million to charity.[419] As of 2015, she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her own, or $45–53 million with her husband.[420]</p>\n <p>Clinton resigned from the foundation’s board in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign and the foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only.[o]</p>\n <p>2016 presidential campaign</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Clinton campaigning for president in Manchester, New Hampshire, in October 2016, with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (seated)<br>\n Main article: Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016<br>\n Further information: United States presidential election, 2016; Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016; and Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016<br>\n On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election.[421] She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure.[422] The campaign’s headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[423] Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act.[424][425] Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,[421] Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton’s Wall Street ties.[417][425]</p>\n <p>In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders,[426][427] making her the first woman to win the Iowa caucuses.[426] In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin.[428] Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20,[429] but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers.[430] Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27.[429] These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.[429]</p>\n <p>On March 1 (“Super Tuesday”), Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders.[431] She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.[432][433][434]</p>\n <p>By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee.[435] On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party.[436] By campaign’s end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders’ 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders’ 47.[437] She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders’ 13 million.[438]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Bernie Sanders endorsing Clinton in New Hampshire, July 2016<br>\n Clinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.[439] Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the Convention the following day.[440] Her opponents in the general election were Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party.</p>\n <p>Clinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton became tied in major polls following the FBI’s conclusion of its investigation into her emails.[441] FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her handling of classified government material.[442] In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a 3 to 4 percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention, in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it is toward the small side by historical standards.[443][444] Following Clinton’s 7 percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August.[445][446]</p>\n <p>Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016 presidential election.[447] By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win and media sources proclaimed him the winner.[448] Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave a victory speech.[449] The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying “We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.”[450] Though Clinton lost the election by only capturing 232 electors to Trump’s 306, a month after the election the popular vote count showed her leading by more than 2.7 million votes, with many votes yet to be counted.[451] She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.[452][453]</p>\n <p>On December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes instead being cast for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders.[454]</p>\n <p>Clinton speaking behind a podium with a microphone in her hand.

Making reference to reports of her being seen taking walks in woods around Chappaqua following her loss in the presidential election,[456][457] Clinton indicated her readiness to emerge from “the woods” and become politically active again.[456]</p>\n <p>In April 2017, Clinton commented that she will not seek public office again.[458]</p>\n <p>Clinton revealed Onward Together, a new political action committee that she wrote as being “dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election”, in a several tweets and an email in May 2017.[459]</p>\n <p>In a June 5, 2017 appearance at the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel, Clinton condemned the 2017 Portland train attack: “When violence motivated by hatred from, Portland, Oregon, to College Park, ends the lives of young Americans, this program’s mission of spreading tolerance is more urgent than ever.”[460] On June 14, after the Congressional baseball shooting, Clinton tweeted, “2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we’re all ultimately on one team. My thoughts are with the members of Congress, staff &amp; heroic police.”[461]</p>\n <p>Comments on President Trump<br>\n On February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indians by Adam Purinton.[462] On April 6, in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Clinton said the US should take out the air fields of Bashar al-Assad and thereby “prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.”[463] On May 2, Clinton said Trump’s use of Twitter “doesn’t work” when pursuing important negotiations and North Korea should not be consulted with an abandoning “of a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table with some kind of realistic prospect for change.”[464] While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump’s 2018 budget proposal was “a con” for underfunding domestic programs.[465] During an appearance at Recode’s Code Conference on May 31, Clinton suggested Trump’s incomplete tweet from earlier in the day was “a hidden message to the Russians.”[466] The following day, after President Trump announced withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a “historic mistake.”[467]</p>\n <p>On March 24, 2017, after the postponing of a Congressional vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Clinton labeled the day “a victory for the 24,000,000 people at risk of losing their health insurance” and warned of an ongoing battle to maintain coverage.[468] Clinton went on to call the American Health Care Act “a disastrous bill” during a San Francisco speech four days later.[469] May 4, after the House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act, Clinton dubbed it a “shameful failure of policy &amp; morality by GOP”.[470] On June 23, the day after Senate Republicans revealed a draft of their healthcare reform legislation, Clinton tweeted, “This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics.

Clinton is in favor of maintaining U.S. influence in the Middle East.<br>\n Several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton’s place on the political spectrum scientifically using her Senate votes. National Journal’s 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.[472] National Journal’s subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.[473] A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her to be likely the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator.[474] The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75 liberal, 23 conservative; Social = 83 liberal, 6 conservative; Foreign = 66 liberal, 30 conservative. Total average = 75 liberal, 20 conservative.[p] According to FiveThirtyEight’s measure of political ideology, “Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.”[475]</p>\n <p>Organizations have also attempted to give newer assessments of Clinton once she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in their “Left Liberal” region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances and an economic score of 10 on a scale of 0 more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances.[476] Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative).[477] Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90 percent “Liberal Quotient” from Americans for Democratic Action,[478] and a lifetime 8 percent rating from the American Conservative Union.[479]</p>\n <p>In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called “optimistic” and “wide-ranging”. Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a “clawback” that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an “exit tax” on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas.[480] Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as “the gold standard”[481] of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that “any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security”.[482][483] As Senator (2001–2009), her record on trade was mixed, voting in favor of some trade agreements but not others.[482]</p>\n <p>Given the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit “unaccountable money” in politics.[484] In July 2016, she “committed” to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.[485][486] On December 7, 2015, in The New York Times, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities.[487]</p>\n <p>Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign logo, a large blue letter “H” with a red arrow facing right, overlaying the horizontal bar of the “H”.

It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn’t politicized…. Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [speaking to Iowans] you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven’t had that and so don’t understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.”[503]</p>\n <p>On foreign affairs, Clinton voted in October 2002 in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq,[504] a vote she later “regretted.”[505] She favored arming Syria’s rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[506] She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.[507][508] Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East.[501] She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, “America can’t ever be neutral when it comes to Israel’s security and survival.”[509] Clinton expressed support for Israel’s right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[510][511] In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields.[512]</p>\n <p>In 2000, Clinton advocated for eliminating the electoral college[513] and promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it resulting in the direct election of the president.[514][515]</p>\n <p>Religious views</p>\n <p>Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church:</p>\n <p>First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge, Illinois—in her early life,<br>\n First United Methodist Church of Little Rock, Arkansas—while in Arkansas,<br>\n Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C.—as First Lady of the United States,<br>\n Metropolitan Community United Methodist Church in New York, New York—currently a congregant.<br>\n She discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky.[516] However, she has infrequently discussed her faith while campaigning.[517][518] Clinton has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one’s neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and “creating opportunities for others to be lifted up”.[518] Clinton has also expressed disappointment that “Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.”[518]</p>\n <p>Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, has suggested that Clinton’s political positions are rooted in her faith. Clinton often expresses a certain maxim which is often attributed to John Wesley: “Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.”[517] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy “made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith.”[519]</p>\n <p>Writings and recordings</p>\n <p>See also: Bibliography of Hillary Clinton<br>\n External video<br>\n Booknotes interview with Clinton about It Takes a Village, March 3, 1996, C-SPAN<br>\n Informal pose of Clinton, in which she is wearing a beige wool jacket and facing toward the right. The angle at which Clinton is photographed is from her bottom right side.<br>\n Clinton in February 2011<br>\n As First Lady of the United States, Clinton published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled “Talking It Over” from 1995 to 2000.[520][521] It focused on her experiences and those of women, children and families she met during her travels around the world.[5]</p>\n <p>In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for the children of America in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. The book made the Best Seller list of The New York Times and Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book’s audio recording.[522] She was the first First Lady to win a Grammy Award.[523]</p>\n <p>Other books published by Clinton when she was first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids’ Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children’s book Beatrice’s Goat.[524]</p>\n <p>In 2003, Clinton released a 562-page autobiography, Living History, for which publisher Simon &amp; Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8 million.[525] The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work,[526] went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication,[527] and was translated into twelve foreign languages.[528] Clinton’s audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[529]</p>\n <p>In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as Secretary of State. As of July 2015, the book has sold about 280,000 copies.[530]</p>\n <p>In 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States if they had won the 2016 presidential election.[531]</p>\n <p>Clinton authored her third memoir, What Happened, about the 2016 election, which was released on September 12, 2017, by Simon &amp; Schuster, in print, e-book, and audio read by the author.[532] A book tour and series of interviews and personal appearances were arranged for the launch.[533]</p>\n <p>Cultural and political image</p>\n <p>Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton, from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found “a virtual cottage industry” of “anti-Clinton literature”, put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints, with titles such as Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary’s Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton’s Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless … Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well[534] (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her.[535] Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable “bogeyman” to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.[536]</p>\n <p>Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture from a wide spectrum of varying perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test,[537] an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, “Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.”[538] She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as first lady and has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers.[539][540] Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her, including but not limited to “The Hillary Shimmy Song”, which went viral.[541][542][543][544]</p>\n <p>A three-story, red brick building in Arkansas. The Rose Law Firm is located inside this building. Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years.<br>\n Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years. Her professional career and political involvement set the stage for public reaction to her as first lady.<br>\n Clinton has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, with some arguing otherwise.[545] James Madison University political science professor Valerie Sulfaro’s 2007 study used the American National Election Studies’ “feeling thermometer” polls, which measure the degree of opinion about a political figure, to find that such polls during Clinton’s first lady years confirm the “conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is a polarizing figure”, with the added insight that “affect towards Mrs. Clinton as first lady tended to be very positive or very negative, with a fairly constant one fourth of respondents feeling ambivalent or neutral”.[546] University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson’s 2006 study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state’s senators, Clinton had the fourth-largest partisan difference of any senator, with a 50-percentage-point difference in approval between New York’s Democrats and Republicans.[547]</p>\n <p>Northern Illinois University political science professor Barbara Burrell’s 2000 study found that Clinton’s Gallup poll favorability numbers broke sharply along partisan lines throughout her time as first lady, with 70 to 90 percent of Democrats typically viewing her favorably while only 20 to 40 percent of Republicans did.[548] University of Wisconsin–Madison political science professor Charles Franklin analyzed her record of favorable versus unfavorable ratings in public opinion polls and found that there was more variation in them during her first lady years than her Senate years. The Senate years showed favorable ratings around 50 percent and unfavorable ratings in the mid-40 percent range; Franklin noted that, “This sharp split is, of course, one of the more widely remarked aspects of Sen. Clinton’s public image.”[549] McGill University professor of history Gil Troy titled his 2006 biography of her Hillary Rodham Clinton: Polarizing First Lady and wrote that after the 1992 campaign, Clinton “was a polarizing figure, with 42 percent [of the public] saying she came closer to their values and lifestyle than previous first ladies and 41 percent disagreeing.”[550] Troy further wrote that Clinton “has been uniquely controversial and contradictory since she first appeared on the national radar screen in 1992” and that she “has alternately fascinated, bedeviled, bewitched and appalled Americans.”[551]</p>\n <p>Line chart showing Clinton’s favorability rankings from 1992 to 2016.

As secretary of state, she enjoyed widespread approval, before dipping as her tenure ended and then to some of her lowest ratings ever as she became viewed as a presidential candidate again.[553]<br>\n Burrell’s study found women consistently rating Clinton more favorably than men by about ten percentage points during her first lady years.[548] Jacobson’s study found a positive correlation across all senators between being women and receiving a partisan-polarized response.[547] Colorado State University communication studies professor Karrin Vasby Anderson describes the first lady position as a “site” for American womanhood, one ready made for the symbolic negotiation of female identity.[554] In particular anderson states there has been a cultural bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against modern first ladies; by the time of Clinton, the first lady position had become a site of heterogeneity and paradox.[554] Burrell, as well as biographers Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., note that Clinton achieved her highest approval ratings as first lady late in 1998, not for professional or political achievements of her own, but for being seen as the victim of her husband’s very public infidelity.[215][548] University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson saw Clinton as an exemplar of the double bind, who though able to live in a “both-and” world of both career and family, nevertheless “became a surrogate on whom we projected our attitudes about attributes once thought incompatible”, leading to her being placed in a variety of no-win situations.[538] Quinnipiac University media studies professor Lisa Burns found press accounts frequently framing Clinton both as an exemplar of the modern professional working mother and as a political interloper interested in usurping power for herself.[555] University of Indianapolis English professor Charlotte Templin found political cartoonists using a variety of stereotypes—such as gender reversal, radical feminist as emasculator and the wife the husband wants to get rid of—to portray Clinton as violating gender norms.[556]</p>\n <p>Side profile of Clinton facing toward her right side. She is speaking into a microphone.<br>\n Clinton in 2009<br>\n Going into the early stages of her presidential campaign for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled “Love Her”, “Hate Her”,[557] while Mother Jones titled its profile of her “Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary”.[558] Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates,[559] while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all.[560][561] An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled “The Waning Power of Hillary Hate”.[562] By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about Clinton on the Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation.[563] She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton’s laugh,[564] that “We know that there’s language to condemn female speech that doesn’t exist for male speech. We call women’s speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton’s laugh was being described as a cackle.”[563] The “bitch” epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics,[565] flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well.[566] Following Clinton’s “choked up moment” and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender’s role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse.[567][568] Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events “brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades … she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics.”[568]</p>\n <p>Hillary Clinton dressed in a black suit and a green shirt, sitting in a café.

The foreground is distorted due to the presence of various small objects.<br>\n Clinton in April 2015<br>\n Once she became Secretary of State, Clinton’s image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure.[333][569] She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal),[570] and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure.[569][571] A 2012 Internet meme, “Texts from Hillary”, was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics.[572] Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, “There’s a certain consistency to who I am and what I do and I think people have finally said, ‘Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'”[333] She continued to do well in Gallup’s most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.[573]</p>\n <p>Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more.[574] By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever.[575] During 2016 she acknowledged that: “I’m not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed.”[576] In July 2017 Bloomberg showed her approval rating at 39 percent.[577]</p>\n <p>Electoral history</p>\n <p>Main article: Electoral history of Hillary Clinton<br>\n New York United States Senate election, 2000<br>\n Party

He earned an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. A third-generation businessman, Trump followed in the footsteps of his grandmother Elizabeth and father Fred in running the family real estate company. He served as chairman and president of The Trump Organization from 1971 until his inauguration as president in January 2017, when he delegated company management to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric. Trump’s business career primarily focused on building or renovating office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses, such as Trump Tower and Trump Taj Mahal.</p>\n <p>Trump also started several side ventures and branded various products with his name. He is credited as having written or co-written several books (including The Art of the Deal), and produced and hosted The Apprentice television series for 12 years. As of 2017, he was the 544th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion.</p>\n <p>Trump had long expressed interest in politics. He entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. His campaign received extensive free media coverage; many of his public statements were controversial or false. Trump won the general election on November 8, 2016, in a surprise victory against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election despite losing the popular vote. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests.</p>\n <p>In domestic policy, Trump has unsuccessfully attempted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He appointed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He ordered a travel ban on citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; the ban was partially implemented after several legal challenges. In foreign policy, he withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Agreement, undid parts of the Cuban Thaw, and ordered missile strikes in Syria in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack. After Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, the Justice Department appointed Comey’s predecessor Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate Russia’s interference in the presidential election, potential links between Russia and Trump campaign associates, and any related matters.</p>\n <p>Contents<br>\n Family and personal life</p>\n <p>Ancestry<br>\n Further information: Trump family<br>\n Trump’s ancestors originated from the German village of Kallstadt, Palatinate, on his father’s side, and from the Outer Hebrides isles of Scotland on his mother’s side. All his grandparents, and his mother, were born in Europe. His mother’s grandfather was also christened “Donald”.[2]</p>\n <p>Trump’s paternal grandfather, Friedrich Trump, first emigrated to the United States in 1885 at the age of 16, and became a citizen in 1892. He amassed a fortune operating boom-town restaurants and boarding houses in the Seattle area and the Klondike region of Canada during the gold rush.[3] On a visit to Kallstadt, he met Elisabeth Christ and married her in 1902. The couple settled in New York permanently in 1905.[4] Frederick died from influenza during the 1918 pandemic.[5]</p>\n <p>Donald’s father, Fred Trump, was born in 1905 in the Bronx. Fred started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15, shortly after his father’s death. Their company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, was primarily active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. Fred eventually built and sold thousands of houses, barracks and apartments.[5][6] The company would later become The Trump Organization after Donald Trump took over in 1971.[7]</p>\n <p>Donald’s mother, Mary Anne, was born in Tong, Lewis, Scotland. At age 18 in 1930, she emigrated to New York, where she worked as a maid.[8] Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens.[8][9]</p>\n <p>Donald’s uncle John Trump was an electrical engineer, physicist, and inventor. He was also a professor at MIT from 1936 to 1973. During World War II, he was involved in radar research for the Allies and helped design X-ray machines that were used to treat cancer.[10]</p>\n <p>Early life and education<br>\n A black-and-white photograph of Donald Trump as a teenager, smiling and wearing a dark pseudo-military uniform with various badges and a light-colored stripe crossing his right shoulder. This image was taken while Trump was in the New York Military Academy in 1964.<br>\n Senior yearbook photo of Trump in 1964 wearing the uniform of his private boarding school, New York Military Academy[11][12]<br>\n Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Queens, New York City. He was the fourth of five children born to Frederick Trump (1905–1999) and Mary Anne Trump (née MacLeod, 1912–2000).[13] His siblings are Maryanne (b. 1937), Fred Jr. (1938–1981), Elizabeth (b. 1942), and Robert (b. 1948).</p>\n <p>Trump grew up in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens. He attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade. At age 13, he enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, after his parents discovered that he had made frequent trips into Manhattan without their permission.[14][15]</p>\n <p>In August 1964, Trump began his higher education at Fordham University.[11][16] After two years, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, because it offered one of the few real-estate studies departments in United States academia at the time.[16][17]</p>\n <p>In addition to his father, Trump was inspired by Manhattan developer William Zeckendorf, vowing to be “even bigger and better”.[18] While at Wharton, he worked at the family business, Elizabeth Trump and Son,[19] graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.[16][20][21]</p>\n <p>Trump was not drafted during the Vietnam War, and he did not enlist either as a volunteer or as a Reserve Officer Training Corps candidate.[22] While Trump was in college from 1964 to 1968, he obtained four student deferments.[23] In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a military medical examination, and in 1968 was briefly classified as fit by a local draft board. In October of that year, he was given a 1-Y medical deferment,[24] which was attributed to heel spurs.[25] In 1969, he received a high number in the draft lottery, which gave him a low probabilty to be called to military service.[24][26][27]</p>\n <p>Family<br>\n Main article: Family of Donald Trump</p>\n <p>Donald Trump is sworn-in as President on January 20, 2017: Trump, wife Melania, son Donald Jr., son Barron, daughter Ivanka, son Eric, and daughter Tiffany<br>\n Trump has five children by three marriages, as well as nine grandchildren.[28][29] His first two marriages ended in widely publicized divorces.[30]</p>\n <p>Trump was 30 years old when he married his first wife, Czech model Ivana Zelníčková, on April 7, 1977, at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan in a ceremony performed by the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale.[31][32] They had three children: son Donald Jr. (b. 1977), daughter Ivanka (b. 1981), and son Eric (b. 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[33] The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump’s affair with actress Marla Maples.[34]</p>\n <p>In October 1993, Maples gave birth to Trump’s daughter, who was named Tiffany after high-end retailer Tiffany &amp; Company.[35] Maples and Trump were married two months later on December 20, 1993.[36] They divorced in 1999,[37] and Tiffany was raised by Marla in California.[38]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>The President and First Lady at the Liberty Ball on Inauguration Day<br>\n On January 22, 2005, Trump married his third wife, Slovenian model Melania Knauss, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida. The ceremony was followed by a reception at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.[39] In 2006, Melania acquired United States citizenship[40] and on March 20 of that year, she gave birth to a son whom they named Barron.[41][42] Melania became First Lady of the United States upon Trump’s inauguration as the nation’s 45th President in January 2017.[43]</p>\n <p>Upon his inauguration as president, Trump delegated the management of his real estate business to his two adult sons, Eric and Don Jr.[44] His daughter Ivanka resigned from The Trump Organization and moved to Washington with her husband Jared Kushner. She serves as an assistant to the president,[45] and he is a Senior Advisor in the White House.[46]</p>\n <p>Trump’s elder sister, Maryanne Barry, is an inactive Federal Appeals Court judge on the Third Circuit.[47]</p>\n <p>Religion<br>\n Trump’s ancestors were Lutheran on his father’s side in Germany[48] and Presbyterian on his mother’s side in Scotland.[49] His parents married in a Manhattan Presbyterian church in 1936.[50] As a child, he attended the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, and had his Confirmation there.[32] In the 1970s, his family joined the Marble Collegiate Church (an affiliate of the Reformed Church in America) in Manhattan.[51] The pastor at that church, Norman Vincent Peale, author of The Power of Positive Thinking and The Art of Living, ministered to Trump’s family and mentored him until Peale’s death in 1993.[52][51] Trump, who is Presbyterian,[53][54] has cited Peale and his works during interviews when asked about the role of religion in his personal life.[51]</p>\n <p>Trump receives Holy Communion, but he has said that he does not ask God for forgiveness. He stated: “I think if I do something wrong, I just try and make it right. I don’t bring God into that picture.”[55] On the campaign trail, Trump has referred to The Art of the Deal as his second favorite book after the Bible, saying, “Nothing beats the Bible.”[56] In a 2016 speech to Liberty University, he referred to “2 Corinthians” (pronounced “Second Corinthians”) as “Two Corinthians”, eliciting chuckles from the audience.[57][58] The New York Times reported that Evangelical Christians nationwide thought “that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure”.[59]</p>\n <p>Trump has had associations with a number of Christian spiritual leaders, including Florida pastor Paula White, who has been called his “closest spiritual confidant.”[60] In 2015, he received a blessing from Greek Orthodox priest Emmanuel Lemelson[61] and in 2016, he released a list of his religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed and others.[62] Referring to his daughter Ivanka’s conversion to Judaism before her marriage to Jared Kushner, Trump said: “I have a Jewish daughter; and I am very honored by that.”[63]</p>\n <p>Health<br>\n Trump’s physician, Harold Bornstein, issued a 2016 medical report that showed Trump’s blood pressure and liver and thyroid function to be in normal ranges.[64][65] He is overweight and takes statins to lower his cholesterol.[65] Trump has said that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed drugs, including marijuana.[66] He also drinks no alcohol; this decision arose in part from watching his older brother Fred Jr. suffer from alcoholism that contributed to his early death in 1981.[67][68]</p>\n <p>Wealth<br>\n Trump said that he began his career with “a small loan of one million dollars” from his father.[69] He appeared on the initial Forbes List of wealthy individuals in 1982 with an estimated $200 million fortune, including an “undefined” share of his parents’ estate.[70] During the 1980s he became a billionaire,[71] but he was absent from the Forbes list following business losses from 1990 to 1995; he reportedly borrowed from his siblings’ trusts in 1993.[70] His father’s estate, valued at more than $20 million, was divided in 1999 among Trump, his three surviving siblings and their children.[72][73]</p>\n <p>A tall rectangular-shaped tower in Las Vegas with exterior windows reflecting a golden hue.

This tower is called the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas.<br>\n Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, with gold infused glass[74]<br>\n When Trump announced his candidacy for the Presidency on June 16, 2015, he released a one-page financial summary that stated a net worth of $8,737,540,000.[75] The following month, he filed a 92-page FEC financial disclosure form[76] and declared his net worth was “in excess of ten billion dollars”.[77] In his presidential announcement speech, he said “I’m really rich”, and stated this would make him less indebted to large campaign donors.[78][79] Forbes believed his net worth estimate was “a whopper”, setting their own estimate at $4.1 billion in 2015. Trump valued his “properties under development” at $293 million; Forbes said they could not evaluate those deals, and booked them for $0.[80][81] Trump’s 2015 FEC disclosure reported $362 million in total income for the year 2014.[77]</p>\n <p>After Trump made controversial remarks about illegal immigrants in 2015, he lost business contracts with several companies; this reduced his Forbes estimate by $125 million.[82] Consumer boycotts and reduced bookings may have further affected his brand value during the presidential campaign.[83][84][85] Trump’s 104-page FEC disclosure in May 2016[86] still claimed a total wealth over $10 billion, unchanged from 2015.[76] The release of the Access Hollywood tapes in October 2016 put further pressure on his brand,[87] but real estate experts predicted a positive rebound after he was elected.[88]</p>\n <p>In its 2017 billionaires’ ranking, Forbes estimated Trump’s net worth at $3.5 billion (544th in the world, 201st in the U.S.)[1] making him one of the richest politicians in American history. These estimates fluctuate from year to year, and among various analysts. In July 2016 Bloomberg News had pegged his wealth at $3 billion, calling it an increase thanks to his presidential nomination,[89] whereas Forbes had ranked him 324th in the world (113th in the U.S.) with $4.5 billion just a few months earlier.[90] The discrepancies among these estimates and with Trump’s own figures stem from the uncertain values of appraised property and of his personal brand.[89][91]</p>\n <p>Business career</p>\n <p>Main article: Business career of Donald Trump<br>\n Real estate</p>\n <p>The distinctive façade of Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan<br>\n Trump started his career at his father’s real estate development company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, which focused on middle-class rental housing in New York City’s outer boroughs, but also had business elsewhere.[92] For example, during his undergraduate study, Trump joined his father Fred in successfully revitalizing the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, thereby boosting the occupancy rate from 66% to 100%.[93][94]</p>\n <p>When his father became chairman of the board in 1971, Trump was promoted to president of the company and renamed it The Trump Organization.[7][95] In 1973, he and his father drew wider attention when the Justice Department contended that the organization systematically discriminated against African Americans wishing to rent apartments rather than merely screening out people based on low income as the Trumps stated. Under an agreement reached in 1975, the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing, and made the Urban League an intermediary for qualified minority applicants.[96][97] His adviser and attorney during (and after) that period was Roy Cohn, who responded to attacks by counterattacking with maximum force, and who valued both positive and negative publicity, which were attitudes that Trump appreciated.[98]</p>\n <p>Manhattan developments<br>\n In 1978, Trump consummated his first major real estate deal in Manhattan when he purchased a half-share in the decrepit Commodore Hotel. The purchase was largely funded by a $70 million construction loan that was jointly guaranteed by Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain. Designed by architect Der Scutt, the project was able to proceed by leveraging competing interests and by taking advantage of tax breaks.[99] After remodeling, the hotel reopened as the Grand Hyatt Hotel, located next to Grand Central Terminal.[100][101]</p>\n <p>Also in 1978, Trump finished negotiations to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 202-meter (663-foot) skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, which The New York Times attributed to his “persistence” and “skills as a negotiator”.[102] To make way for the new building, a crew of undocumented Polish workers demolished an old Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features that had initially been marked for preservation.[103] The building was completed in 1983 and houses both the primary penthouse condominium residence of Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization.[104][105] Architectural critic Paul Goldberger said in 1983 that he was surprised to find the tower’s atrium was “the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years”.[106][107] Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television show The Apprentice and includes a fully functional television studio set.[108]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Central Park’s Wollman Rink after the Trump renovation<br>\n Repairs on Central Park’s Wollman Rink were started in 1980 by a general contractor who was unconnected to Trump. Despite an expected two and one-half year construction schedule, the repairs were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $1.95 million, $775,000 less than the initial budget, and operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity in exchange for the rink’s concession rights.[109]</p>\n <p>In 1988 Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for a record-setting $407 million and asked his wife Ivana to manage its operation.[110] Trump invested $50 million to restore the building, which he called “the Mona Lisa”.[111] According to hotel expert Thomas McConnell, the Trumps boosted it from a three-star to a four-star ranking and sold it in 1995, by which time Ivana was no longer involved.[112]</p>\n <p>In 1994, Trump became involved with a building on Columbus Circle that was swaying in the wind. He began a reconstruction project that stopped the swaying and gave the building a full makeover.[113][114] Trump thereafter owned commercial space in that 44-story mixed-use tower (hotel and condominium), which he named Trump International Hotel and Tower.[115]</p>\n <p>In 1996, Trump acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street that had briefly been the tallest building in the world when it was completed in 1930. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street.[116]</p>\n <p>In 1997, he began construction on Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. The project encountered delays the following year because a subcontracter had to replace defective concrete.[117][118] He and the other investors in the project ultimately sold their interest for $1.8 billion in 2005 in what was then the biggest residential sale in the history of New York City.[119]</p>\n <p>From 1994 to 2002, Trump owned a 50% share of the Empire State Building. He would have renamed it “Trump Empire State Building Tower Apartments” if he had been able to boost his share.[120][121]</p>\n <p>In 2001, Trump completed Trump World Tower, which was across from the headquarters of the United Nations. For a while, the structure was the tallest all-residential tower in the world.[122] In 2002, Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue; the building consisted of 35 stories of luxury condominiums.[123] Meanwhile, he continued to own millions of square feet of other prime Manhattan real estate.[124]</p>\n <p>Palm Beach estate<br>\n Main article: Mar-a-Lago</p>\n <p>Mar-a-Lago in 2009</p>\n <p>The Trumps with Chinese President Xi Jinping and wife at Mar-a-Lago in 2017<br>\n In 1985, Trump acquired the historic Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida for $5 million plus $3 million for the home’s furnishings. The home was built in the 1920s by heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post, who envisioned the house as a future winter retreat for American presidents.</p>\n <p>Trump’s initial offer of $28 million had been rejected, and he was able to get the property at the much lower price by purchasing separate beachfront property and threatening to build a house on it that would block Mar-a-Lago’s ocean view. In addition to using the estate as a home, Trump also turned it into a private club open to everyone who could afford the initiation fee of $100,000 plus annual dues.[125]</p>\n <p>In 1986, Trump acquired a foreclosed 33-story, twin-tower condominium complex in nearby West Palm Beach for $40 million. Auto CEO Lee Iacocca invested in three of the condos.[126] Trump spruced up the complex’s public areas and heavily promoted the property for years, but selling the units proved difficult, and the deal turned out to be unprofitable.[127]</p>\n <p>Atlantic City casinos<br>\n New Jersey legalized casino gambling in 1977, and the following year Trump was in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to explore how he might get involved in a new business venture. Seven years later, Harrah’s at Trump Plaza hotel and casino opened there; the multi-use unit was built by Trump with financing from Holiday Corporation, which also was managing that business.[128] Renamed “Trump Plaza” soon after opening, it was at that time the tallest building in Atlantic City.[129] The casino’s poor financial results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp., which led to Trump’s paying $70 million in May 1986 to buy out their interest in the property.[130][131] Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320 million; when completed in 1985, that hotel and casino became Trump Castle, and Trump’s wife, Ivana, managed that property until Trump transferred her in 1988 to run the Trump Plaza Hotel in New York.[132][133]</p>\n <p>The entrance of the Trump Taj Mahal, a casino in Atlantic City. It has motifs evocative of the Taj Mahal in India.<br>\n Entrance of the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City<br>\n Also in 1988, Trump acquired his third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal (then halfway through construction), by making a complex transaction with the television host and entertainer Merv Griffin as well as the resort and casino company Resorts International.[134] In October 1989, three of his top Atlantic City executives were killed in a helicopter accident, which both stymied and delayed the planned opening of the Taj Mahal.[135] The Taj finally opened in April 1990 and was built at a total cost of $1.1 billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever.[136][137] The project was financed with $675 million in junk bonds[138] and was a major gamble by Trump.[139] The project underwent debt restructuring the following year,[140] leaving Trump with 50% ownership.[141] He also sold his 282-foot (86 m) megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers.[142][143]</p>\n <p>In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana.[144] THCR purchased Taj Mahal in 1996 and underwent bankruptcy restructuring in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[145] From mid 1995 until early 2009, he served as chairman of the publicly-traded THCR organization—which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts—and served as CEO from mid 2000 to mid 2005.[146]</p>\n <p>During the 1990s, Trump’s casino ventures faced competition from Native American gaming at the Foxwoods casino located on an Indian reservation in Connecticut, where it was exempt from the state’s anti-gambling laws. Trump stated in 1993 that the casino owners did not look like real Indians to him or to other Indians.[147] Subsequent to that well-publicized remark about the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, Trump became a key investor backing the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots, who were also seeking state recognition.[148]</p>\n <p>Golf courses<br>\n A golf course.

This picture was taken in Ayrshire, Scotland.<br>\n Turnberry Hotel and golf course, Ayrshire, Scotland<br>\n The Trump Organization operates many golf courses and resorts in the United States and around the world. According to Golfweek, Trump owns or manages about 18 golf courses.[149] His personal financial disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission stated that his golf and resort revenue for the year 2015 was roughly $382 million,[76][86] while his three European golf courses did not show a profit.[89]</p>\n <p>In 2006, Trump bought 1,400 acres (570 ha), including the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and created a golf resort there.[150] Scottish supporters emphasized potential economic benefits, and opponents emphasized potential environmental harm to a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).[151][152][153] A spokesperson for the golf course has said 95% of the SSSI is untouched.[154] A 2011 independent documentary, You’ve Been Trumped, chronicled the golf resort’s construction and struggles.[155] In 2015, an offshore windfarm being built within sight of the golf course prompted a legal challenge by Trump, which was dismissed by the U.K. Supreme Court.[156] In the wake of the 2008 recession, Trump greatly scaled back development of this property, and as of December 2016 Scottish officials were pushing for completion of the far larger development as originally approved.[157]</p>\n <p>In April 2014, Trump purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland, which hosted the Open Championship four times between 1977 and 2009.[158][159] After extensive renovations and a remodeling of the course by golf architect Martin Ebert, Turnberry was re-opened in June 2016.[160]</p>\n <p>Hotels outside New York</p>\n <p>Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago</p>\n <p>Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver<br>\n In the late 2000s and early 2010s, The Trump Organization expanded its footprint in the United States beyond New York and into a few other countries with the co-development and management of hotel towers in Chicago, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., Panama City, Toronto, and Vancouver. There are also Trump-branded buildings in Dubai, Honolulu, Istanbul, Manila, Mumbai and in Indonesia.[161]</p>\n <p>Branding and licensing<br>\n Main article: List of things named after Donald Trump<br>\n Trump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies. He has also licensed his name for various commercial products and services. In doing so, he achieved mixed success for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects.[162] In 2011, Forbes’ financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3 billion.[163]</p>\n <p>Legal affairs and bankruptcies<br>\n Main article: Legal affairs of Donald Trump<br>\n As of 2016, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 3,500 state and federal legal actions. He or one of his companies was the plaintiff in 1,900 cases and the defendant in 1,450. With Trump or his company as plaintiff, more than half the cases have been against gamblers at his casinos who had failed to pay off their debts. With Trump or his company as a defendant, the most common type of case involved personal injury cases at his hotels. In cases where there was a clear resolution, Trump’s side won 451 times and lost 38.[164][165]</p>\n <p>Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, but his hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[166][167] Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, “I do play with the bankruptcy laws – they’re very good for me” as a tool for trimming debt.[168][169]</p>\n <p>The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[170][171] Trump said, “I’ve used the laws of this country to pare debt … We’ll have the company. We’ll throw it into a chapter. We’ll negotiate with the banks. We’ll make a fantastic deal. You know, it’s like on The Apprentice. It’s not personal. It’s just business.”[140]</p>\n <p>A 2016 analysis of Trump’s business career by The Economist concluded that his “… performance [from 1985 to 2016] has been mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York”, noting both his successes and bankruptcies.[172] A subsequent analysis by The Washington Post concluded that “Trump is a mix of braggadocio, business failures, and real success”, calling his casino bankruptcies the “most infamous flop” of his business career.[173]</p>\n <p>Side ventures<br>\n After Trump took charge of the family real estate firm in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization, he not only greatly expanded its real estate operations, but also ventured into numerous other business activities. The company eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.[174]</p>\n <p>Sports events<br>\n In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals—an American football team that played in the United States Football League (USFL)—from oil magnate J. Walter Duncan. The USFL played three seasons during the spring and summer. After the 1985 season, the organization folded due to continuous financial difficulties, despite winning an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL.[175]</p>\n <p>Trump remained involved with other sports after the Generals folded; he operated golf courses in several countries.[175] At the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, he hosted several boxing matches, which included Mike Tyson’s 1988 heavyweight championship fight against Michael Spinks.[176] He also acted as a financial advisor to Mike Tyson.[177] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d’Italia.[178]</p>\n <p>Miss Universe<br>\n Main articles: Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA<br>\n From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe pageants.[179][180] The Miss Universe Pageants include Miss USA and Miss Teen USA, and his management of this business involved his family members; for example, daughter Ivanka once hosted Miss Teen USA. Trump hired the first female president of the Miss Universe business in 1997.[181] He became dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled the pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002.[182][183]</p>\n <p>In his 2015 U.S. presidential campaign kickoff speech, Trump made statements about illegal immigrants who crossed the border from Mexico. NBC then decided to end its business relationship with him and stated that it would no longer air the Miss Universe or Miss USA pageants on its networks.[184] In September 2015, Trump bought NBC’s share of the Miss Universe Organization and became its sole owner for three days. He then sold the entire company to the WME/IMG talent agency.[185]</p>\n <p>Trump University<br>\n Main article: Trump University<br>\n Trump University was a for-profit education company that was founded by Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny. The company ran a real estate training program and charged between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[186][187][188] In 2005, the operation was notified by New York State authorities that its use of the word “university” was misleading and violated state law. After a second such notification in 2010, the name of the company was changed to the “Trump Entrepreneurial Institute”.[189] Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[190]</p>\n <p>In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit alleging that Trump University made false statements and defrauded consumers.[189][191] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court relating to Trump University; they named Trump personally as well as his companies.[192] During the presidential campaign, Trump criticized Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel who oversaw those two cases, alleging bias in his rulings because of his Mexican heritage.[193][194] Shortly after Trump won the presidency, the parties agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases, whereby Trump paid a total of $25 million and denied any wrongdoing.[195][196]</p>\n <p>Foundation<br>\n Main article: Donald J. Trump Foundation<br>\n The Donald J. Trump Foundation is a U.S.-based private foundation[197] established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal by Trump and Tony Schwartz.[198][199] The foundation’s funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump,[200] who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.[200]</p>\n <p>The foundation’s tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[201] In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York–Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000).[202][203] From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5 million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007.[200] Linda McMahon later became Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[204]</p>\n <p>In 2016, investigations by The Washington Post uncovered several potential legal and ethical violations conducted by the charity, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[205] After beginning an investigation into the foundation, the New York State Attorney General’s office notified the Trump Foundation that it was allegedly in violation of New York laws regarding charities, and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[206][207][208] A Trump spokesman called the investigation a “partisan hit job”.[206] In response to mounting complaints, Trump’s team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove “even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President.”[209]</p>\n <p>Resignation<br>\n When Trump was elected president of the United States in November 2016, questions arose over how he would avoid conflicts of interest between his work in the White House and his business activities. At a press conference on January 10, 2017, Trump said that he and his daughter Ivanka would resign all roles with The Trump Organization, while his two adult sons Don Jr. and Eric would run the business, together with Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg.[210]</p>\n <p>Trump retained his financial stake in the business.[211] His attorney Sherri Dillon said that before the January 20 inauguration, Trump would put those business assets into a trust, which would hire an ethics advisor and a compliance counsel. She added that The Trump Organization would not enter any new foreign business deals, while continuing to pursue domestic opportunities.[212] As of April 2017, Trump companies owned more than 400 condo units and home lots in the United States, valued at over $250 million in total ($200,000 to $35 million each).[213]</p>\n <p>Media career</p>\n <p>The Apprentice<br>\n Main articles: The Apprentice (U.S. TV series) and The Apprentice (TV series)<br>\n Donald Trump posing with former basketball player Dennis Rodman in a room with paintings adorning the walls.

Contestants were successively “fired” and eliminated from the game. For the first year of the show, Trump earned $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show’s initial success, he was paid $1 million per episode.[214] In a July 2015 press release, Trump’s campaign manager said that NBCUniversal had paid him $213,606,575 for his 14 seasons hosting the show,[77] although the network did not verify the statement.[215] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to television on The Apprentice.[162][216]</p>\n <p>Along with British TV producer Mark Burnett, Trump was hired as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities compete to win money for their charities.

A dedicated parody series called The President Show debuted in April 2017.[233]</p>\n <p>Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show on talk radio.[234] Trump also had his own daily talk radio program called Trumped!, from 2004 to 2008.[235][236][237] Since the 1980s, Trump’s wealth and lifestyle have been a fixture of hip hop lyrics,[238] his name being quoted by more than 50 artists.[239]</p>\n <p>Political career up to 2015</p>\n <p>Early involvement in politics<br>\n a full-page newspaper advertisement in which Trump placed full-page advertisements critiquing U.S. defense policy<br>\n Trump’s September 1987 advertisement in The Boston Globe, criticizing U.S. defense policy<br>\n Trump first vaguely expressed interest in running for office in 1987, when he spent almost $100,000 to place full-page advertisements in several newspapers. In his view at that time, “America should stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves”,[240] and “should present Western Europe and Japan with a bill for America’s efforts to safeguard the passage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.”[241] According to a Gallup poll in December 1988, Trump was the tenth most admired person in America.[242][243]</p>\n <p>Trump considered running for president in 1988, 2000, 2004, and 2012, and for Governor of New York in 2006 and 2014, but aside from 2000 did not enter any of those races.[244][245] In February 2009, Trump appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and spoke about the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10. He said that “instead of asking for money”, General Motors “should go into bankruptcy and work that stuff out in a deal.”[246]</p>\n <p>Trump publicly speculated about seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, and a Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll released in March 2011 found Trump leading among potential contenders; he was one point ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.[247] A Newsweek poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of incumbent president Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for president of the United States.[248] A poll released in April 2011 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for president while he was still actively considering a run.[249][250] His moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[251][252][253]</p>\n <p>Trump played a leading role in “birther” conspiracy theories that had been circulating since President Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.[254][255] Beginning in March 2011, Trump publicly questioned Obama’s citizenship and eligibility to serve as President.[256][257][258] Although the Obama campaign had released a copy of the short-form birth certificate in 2008,[259] Trump demanded to see the original “long-form” certificate.[256] He mentioned having sent investigators to Hawaii to research the question, but he did not follow up with any findings.[256] He also repeated a debunked allegation that Obama’s grandmother said she had witnessed his birth in Kenya.[260][261] When the White House later released Obama’s long-form birth certificate,[262] Trump took credit for obtaining the document, saying “I hope it checks out.”[263] His official biography mentions his purported role in forcing Obama’s hand,[264] and he has defended his pursuit of the issue when prompted, later saying that his promotion of the conspiracy made him “very popular”.[265] In 2011, Trump had called for Obama to release his student records, questioning whether his grades warranted entry into an Ivy League school.[266] When asked in 2015 whether he believed Obama was born in the United States, Trump said he did not want to discuss the matter further.[267][268] In September 2016, Trump publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S., and said that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign.[257][269][270]</p>\n <p>Donald Trump, dressed in a black suit with white shirt, and blue tie.

His appearance at CPAC was organized by GOProud, an LGBT conservative organization, in conjunction with GOProud supporter Roger Stone, who was close with Trump. GOProud pushed for a write-in campaign for Trump at CPAC’s presidential straw poll. The 2011 CPAC speech Trump gave is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[271][272]</p>\n <p>In the 2012 Republican primaries, Trump generally had polled at or below 17 percent among the crowded field of possible candidates.[273] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election, while also saying he would have become the President of the United States, had he run.[251]</p>\n <p>In 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).[274] During the lightly attended early-morning speech, Trump spoke out against illegal immigration, then-President Obama’s “unprecedented media protection”, and advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.[275][276]</p>\n <p>Additionally, Trump spent over $1 million in 2013 to research a possible run for president of the United States.[277] In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. In response to the memo, Trump said that while New York had problems and that its taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him.[278] In January 2014, Trump made statements denying climate change that were discordant with the opinion of the scientific community.[279] A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election.[280] In February 2015, Trump told NBC that he was not prepared to sign on for another season of The Apprentice, as he mulled his political future.[281]</p>\n <p>Political affiliations<br>\n Trump shaking hands with President Ronald Reagan in 1987.

Trump was a Democrat prior to 1987.[282] In 1987, Trump registered as a Republican in Manhattan.[283]</p>\n <p>In 1999, Trump switched to the Reform Party and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001 due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.[284]</p>\n <p>From 2001 to 2008, Trump identified himself as a Democrat, but in 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for President. In 2009, he officially changed his party registration to Republican.[285] In December 2011, Trump became an independent for five months before returning to the Republican Party, where he later pledged to stay.[286][287]</p>\n <p>Trump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top ten recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans.[288] After 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats.[289] In February 2012, Trump openly endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for President.[290] When asked in 2015 which of the last four presidents he prefers, Trump picked Democrat Bill Clinton over the Republican Bushes.[291][292]</p>\n <p>According to a New York state report, Trump circumvented corporate and personal campaign donation limits in the 1980s—although no laws were broken—by donating money to candidates from 18 different business subsidiaries, rather than donating primarily in his own name.[293][294] Trump told investigators he did so on the advice of his lawyers. He also said the contributions were not to gain favor with business-friendly candidates, but simply to satisfy requests from friends.[293][295]</p>\n <p>2000 presidential campaign<br>\n Main article: Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000<br>\n In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in 2000.[284][296] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W.

In the speech, Trump drew attention to domestic issues such as illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large priorities during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again”.[301]</p>\n <p>In his campaign, Trump said that he disdained political correctness; he also stated that the media had intentionally misinterpreted his words, and he made other claims of adverse media bias.[302][303][304] In part due to his fame, Trump received an unprecedented amount of free media coverage during his run for the presidency, which elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.[305]</p>\n <p>Republican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan were hesitant to support him during his early quest for the presidency. They doubted his chances of winning the general election and feared that he could harm the image of the Republican Party.[306][307]</p>\n <p>The alt-right movement coalesced around Trump’s candidacy,[308] due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[309][310] The connection of this group to the Trump campaign is controversial; writers such as Jon Ronson have suggested that the link between Trump and right-wing figures such as Alex Jones and Roger Stone is a marriage of convenience.[311] Trump personally condemned the alt-right in an interview after the election.[312]</p>\n <p>During the campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white nationalists,[313] especially in his initial refusal to condemn the support of David Duke—a former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan—in a CNN interview with Jake Tapper. He had previously criticized Duke in 1991, disavowed the 2000 Reform Party due to the support of Duke and others, and disavowed Duke on the campaign trail both before and after the interview.[314] In August, he appointed Steve Bannon—the executive chairman of Breitbart News—as his campaign CEO; the website was described by Bannon as “the platform for the alt-right.”[315] However, Bannon later told the Wall Street Journal that he was an “economic nationalist” but not “a supporter of ethno-nationalism.”[316] According to Michael Barkun, the Trump campaign was remarkable for bringing fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[317]</p>\n <p>Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on Trump supporters and vice-versa both inside and outside the venues.[318][319][320]</p>\n <p>Campaign rhetoric<br>\n Fact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates.[321][322][323] At least four major publications – Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times – have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements.[324] NPR said that Trump’s campaign statements were often opaque or suggestive.[325] Lucas Graves, an assistant professor of journalism and mass communication at the University of Wisconsin–Madison,[326] opined that Trump “often speaks in a suggestive way that makes it unclear what exactly he meant, so that fact-checkers “have to be really careful” when picking claims to check, “to pick things that reflect what the speaker was clearly trying to communicate.”[327]</p>\n <p>Trump’s penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth and where puffery abounds.[328] Trump has called his public speaking style “truthful hyperbole”, an effective political tactic that may, however, backfire for overpromising.[328] Martin Medhurst, a Baylor University professor of communication and political science, analyzed Trump’s frequently used rhetorical devices, such as catchy slogans, hyperbole, insinuations and preterition.[329]</p>\n <p>Financial disclosures<br>\n Further information: Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016 § Refusal to release tax returns<br>\n In compliance with FEC regulations of all presidential candidates, Trump published a 92-page financial disclosure form in 2015; the form listed all of his assets, liabilities, income sources and hundreds of business positions.[76] His decision not to release his tax returns[330] was contrary to usual practice by every presidential candidate since Gerald Ford in 1976.[331] Although there is no law that requires presidential candidates to release their returns,[332] Trump’s refusal led to speculation that he was hiding something.[333] Trump explained that his tax returns were being audited and his lawyers had advised him against releasing the returns.[334][335] However, no law prohibits release of tax returns during an audit.[336] Tax attorneys differ about whether such a release is wise legal strategy.[337] Trump has told the news media that his tax rate was “none of your business”, but added, “I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.”[338][339][340]</p>\n <p>On October 1, 2016, three pages of Trump’s 1995 tax return were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times, who said she received the documents in her Times mailbox. Each of the three pages is one page from Trump’s state filings in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. They show that using allowed deductions for losses, Trump claimed a loss of $916 million that year. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.[341] When asked if he used the tax code to avoid paying taxes, he said, “Of course I did. Of course I did.” He then went on to say he paid “hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes”, calling it a “simple” thing. “I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too”, he said.[342][343][344]</p>\n <p>On March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump’s 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, who unveiled them on her show. The two pages showed that Trump paid $38 million in federal taxes and had a gross adjusted income of $150 million.[345][346] The White House confirmed the authenticity of the 2005 documents and stated: “Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.”[345][346]</p>\n <p>Republican primaries<br>\n Main article: Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016</p>\n <p>Trump rally in the U.S. Bank Arena, Cincinnati, Ohio, on October 13, 2016<br>\n Trump entered a field of 17 major candidates who were vying for the 2016 Republican nomination; this was the largest presidential field in American history.[347] Trump participated in eleven of the twelve Republican debates, skipping only the January 28th seventh debate, which was the last debate before primary voting began on the first of February. The debates received historically high television ratings, which increased the visibility of Trump’s campaign.[348]</p>\n <p>By early 2016, the race had mostly centered on Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.[349] On Super Tuesday, Trump won the plurality of the vote, and he remained the front-runner throughout the remainder of the primaries. By March 2016, Trump became poised to win the Republican nomination.[350] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016—which prompted the remaining candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns—RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[351] With nearly 14 million votes, Trump broke the all-time record in the history of the Republican Party for winning the most primary votes.

NBC News anchor Lester Holt was the moderator.[365] The TV broadcast was the most watched presidential debate in United States history.[366] The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning narrative of that debate was dominated by a leaked tape of Trump making lewd comments, and counter-accusations by Trump of sexual misconduct done by Bill Clinton. Trump had invited four women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to a press conference prior to the debate. The final presidential debate was held on October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Trump’s refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular press attention.[367][368]</p>\n <p>Political positions<br>\n Main article: Political positions of Donald Trump<br>\n Trump’s campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.–Mexico border. His other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. During the campaign, he also advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS or IS).</p>\n <p>Media have described Trump’s political positions as “populist”,[369][370] and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation,[371] consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment,[372] usually considered a liberal (Democratic Party) policy.[373][374] According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a “fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views”, but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[375][376]</p>\n <p>Trump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time.[377][378][379] Politico has described his positions as “eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory”,[379] while NBC News counted “141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues” during his campaign.[380]</p>\n <p>Russian interference in election<br>\n Main article: Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections<br>\n In January 2017, American intelligence agencies – the CIA, FBI and NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence – jointly stated with “high confidence” that the Russian government attempted to intervene in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[381][382] In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, former FBI Director James Comey affirmed he has “no doubt” that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, adding “they did it with purpose and sophistication”.[383][384]</p>\n <p>Trump claims that the investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election is the pursuit of a false narrative, calling it “the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!”[385] Russian president Vladimir Putin echoed Trump’s opinion, saying that Democrats cling to this fictitious explanation to avoid confronting their election loss.[386]</p>\n <p>Interactions with Russia<br>\n Main article: Links between Trump associates and Russian officials</p>\n <p>Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump at the 2017 G-20 Hamburg Summit<br>\n There has been intensive media scrutiny of Trump’s relationship to Russia.[387][388] During the campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a strong leader.[389][390] One of his campaign managers, Paul Manafort, had worked for several years to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovich win the Ukrainian presidency.[391] Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, have been connected to Russian officials.[392][393] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[394]</p>\n <p>Members of Trump’s campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[395] In a December 29, 2016 conversation, Flynn and Kislyak discussed the recently imposed sanctions against Russia; Trump later fired Flynn for falsely claiming he had not discussed the sanctions.[396]</p>\n <p>In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that “the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.”[397]</p>\n <p>In 2017, Trump and other senior White House officials asked the Director of National Intelligence, the NSA director, the FBI director, and two chairs of congressional committees to publicly dispute the news reports about contacts between Trump associates and Russia.[398]</p>\n <p>Sexual misconduct allegations<br>\n Main articles: Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording and Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations<br>\n Two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women.[399][400][401] The hot mic recording was captured on a studio bus in which Trump and Billy Bush were preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. “I just start kissing them,” Trump said, “I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything … grab them by the pussy.”[402] During the recording, Trump also spoke of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he “moved on her very heavily.”[402] These statements were recorded several months after Trump married his third and current wife, Melania, who was pregnant at the time.[402][403]</p>\n <p>Trump’s language on the tape was described by the media as “vulgar”, “sexist”, and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident prompted him to make his first public apology during the campaign,[404][405] and caused outrage across the political spectrum,[406][407] with many Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of his candidacy and some urging him to quit the race.[408] Subsequently, at least 15 women[409] came forward with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping, resulting in widespread media coverage.[410][411]</p>\n <p>Trump and his campaign have denied all of the sexual misconduct accusations, which Trump has called “false smears”, and alleged a conspiracy against him.[412][413][414] In his two public statements in response to the controversy, Trump responded by alleging that Bill Clinton, former President of the United States and husband of Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, had “abused women” and that Hillary had bullied her husband’s victims.[415]</p>\n <p>Election to the presidency<br>\n Main article: United States presidential election, 2016</p>\n <p>2016 electoral vote results<br>\n On Election Day, November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 electoral votes to Clinton’s 232 votes. The counts were later adjusted to 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides, formalizing Trump’s election to the presidency.[416] In the early hours of November 9, Clinton called Trump to concede the election. Trump then delivered his victory speech before hundreds of supporters in the New York Hilton hotel. The speech was in contrast with some of his previous rhetoric, with Trump promising to heal the division caused by the election, thanking Clinton for her service to the country, and promising to be a president to all Americans.[417][418]</p>\n <p>Trump received a smaller share of the popular vote than Clinton, making him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[419][nb 1] Clinton finished ahead by 2.86 million votes or 2.1 percentage points, 48.04% to 46.09%, with neither candidate reaching a majority nationwide.[422][423]</p>\n <p>Trump’s victory was considered a stunning political upset, as polls consistently showed Hillary Clinton leading nationwide (which were consistent with her win in the popular vote) and in most battleground states, while Trump’s support had been underestimated throughout his campaign.[424] The errors in some state polls were later partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton’s support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump’s support among white working-class voters.[425] Trump won the perennial swing states of Florida, Iowa and Ohio, and flipped Clinton’s “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which had been Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Trump’s victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control of both chambers of Congress, as was the case during parts of George W. Bush’s presidency from 2003 to 2007.</p>\n <p>Trump is the wealthiest president in U.S. history.[426] He is also the first president without prior governmental or military experience.[427][428][429] Of the 43[nb 2] previous presidents, 38 had held prior elective office; two had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet; and three had never held public office but had been commanding generals.[429]</p>\n <p>Protests<br>\n Main article: Protests against Donald Trump<br>\n Trump’s election victory sparked protests across the United States. His opponents took to the streets to amplify their opposition to Trump’s views and denounce his inflammatory statements. Trump initially said on Twitter that the protests consisted of “professional protesters, incited by the media”, and were “unfair”, but he later stated that he loves their passion for the country.[431][432] After Obama’s re-election in 2012, Trump had tweeted “We can’t let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!”[433]</p>\n <p>On the Saturday following Trump’s inauguration, massive demonstrations took place in the United States and worldwide in protest of Trump; approximately 2,600,000 people took part in Women’s Marches worldwide.[434] One of these marches was the Women’s March on Washington (in Washington, D.C.), where over 500,000 people marched in opposition to Trump.[435]</p>\n <p>Electoral history<br>\n Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016<br>\n Party Candidate Votes %<br>\n Republican Donald Trump 14,015,993 votes<br>\n 1,441 delegates<br>\n (41 contests) Votes: 44.9%<br>\n Delegates: 58.3%<br>\n Republican Ted Cruz 7,822,100 votes<br>\n 551 delegates<br>\n (11 contests) Votes: 25.1%<br>\n Delegates: 22.3%<br>\n Republican Marco Rubio 3,515,576 votes<br>\n 173 delegates<br>\n (3 contests) Votes: 11.3%<br>\n Delegates: 7%<br>\n Republican John Kasich 4,290,448 votes<br>\n 161 delegates<br>\n (1 contest) Votes: 13.8%<br>\n Delegates: 6.5%<br>\n United States presidential election, 2016<br>\n Party Candidate Votes %<br>\n Republican Donald Trump 62,979,879 votes<br>\n 304 electors<br>\n (30 states + ME-02) Votes: 46.0%<br>\n Electors: 56.5%<br>\n Democratic Hillary Clinton 65,844,954 votes<br>\n 227 electors<br>\n (20 states + DC) Votes: 48.1%<br>\n Electors: 42.2%<br>\n Presidency</p>\n <p>Main article: Presidency of Donald Trump<br>\n For a chronological guide to this subject, see Timeline of the presidency of Donald Trump.<br>\n Transition<br>\n Main article: Presidential transition of Donald Trump</p>\n <p>President Obama and President-elect Trump meet in the Oval Office on November 10, 2016, two days after the election.<br>\n On November 10, Trump had his first ever meeting with outgoing President Barack Obama to discuss plans for an orderly transition of power. The New York Times said, “It was an extraordinary show of cordiality and respect between two men who have been political enemies and are stylistic opposites.”[436] The BBC stated that “their antipathy was barely concealed” in “awkward photos” of the meeting.[437]</p>\n <p>White House appointments<br>\n For a more comprehensive list, see Political appointments of Donald Trump.<br>\n New Jersey Governor Chris Christie led Trump’s transition team until November 11, 2016, when Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over.[438] Since then, Trump has chosen RNC chairman Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff[439] and businessman and media executive Steve Bannon as White House Chief Strategist.[440]</p>\n <p>Cabinet-level nominations<br>\n Main articles: Cabinet of Donald Trump and Formation of Donald Trump’s Cabinet<br>\n Trump’s cabinet nominations included Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General,[441] financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury,[442] retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense,[443] and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.[444] Trump also brought on board politicians who had opposed him during the presidential campaign, notably neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[445] and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations.[446]</p>\n <p>While most of Trump’s nominees were approved by the GOP majority in the Senate, the confirmation of education reform activist Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education[447] required Vice President Pence to cast a rare tie-breaking vote.[448]</p>\n <p>Most cabinet members were unable to take office on Inauguration Day because of delays in the formal confirmation process. Part of the lateness was ascribed to delays in submitting background-check paperwork, and part to obstructionism by Senate Democrats.[449] The last Cabinet member, Robert Lighthizer, took office as U.S. Trade Representative on May 11, 2017, more than four months after his nomination.[450]</p>\n <p>Pre-inauguration events<br>\n On November 22, Trump outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office in a video posted on YouTube. The plan included the United States’ withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and asking the U.S. Department of Defense to develop a plan to protect the U.S. from cyber-attack.[451][452]</p>\n <p>On December 7, Time named Trump as its “Person of the Year”.[453] In an interview on The Today Show, he said he was honored by the award, but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the “President of the Divided States of America.”[454][455] He also opposed Time’s decision to change its “Man of the Year” title to “Person of the Year” in 1999, describing the action as too “politically correct”.[456] On December 13 he was named Financial Times Person of the Year.[457] In December 2016, Forbes ranked Trump the second most powerful person in the world, after Vladimir Putin and before Angela Merkel.[458]</p>\n <p>Based on intelligence reports issued from October 2016 to January 2017, the Obama administration accused the Russian government of trying to influence the U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump, by supplying the DNC emails to WikiLeaks for publication.[459] Trump,[460] WikiLeaks[461] and Russian officials[462] have denied the allegations.</p>\n <p>Early actions<br>\n Main article: First 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency</p>\n <p>Chief Justice John Roberts administers the oath of office to Donald Trump as his family looks on.<br>\n Trump’s inauguration as the 45th President was held on Friday, January 20, 2017. In his first week as president, Trump signed six executive orders. His first order as president set out interim procedures in anticipation of repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). That same week, Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, re-instated the Mexico City Policy, reopened the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects and signed an executive order to begin planning, designing and constructing a new Mexico border wall and reinforce border security.[463]</p>\n <p>On January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[464] The Senate confirmed the nomination on April 7 with a 54–45 vote.[465]</p>\n <p>Travel ban<br>\n Main articles: Executive Order 13769, Executive Order 13780, and Legal challenges to Executive Orders 13769 and 13780</p>\n <p>Trump signing Executive Order 13769 at the Pentagon as the Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Defense James Mattis look on, January 27, 2017<br>\n On January 27, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns about terrorism. The order was imposed without warning and took effect immediately.[466] Confusion and protests caused chaos at many airports,[467] as travelers were detained on arriving in the United States or barred from boarding U.S.-bound planes.[468] The administration then clarified that visitors with a green card were exempt from the ban.[469][470]</p>\n <p>On January 30, Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General, directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the executive order and was promptly dismissed.[471] She was replaced as acting Attorney General by Dana Boente, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who agreed to enforce the order.[472] Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and on February 5 a federal judge in Seattle blocked its implementation.[473][474] On October 24, 2017, the Supreme Court dismissed the only remaining travel ban appeal as being moot because the revised order had expired. It expressed “no views on the merits” of the case.[475]</p>\n <p>On March 6, Trump issued a revised order, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, removed priorities for religious minorities (e.g. Christian refugees), and allowed for a week to implement legislation.[476][466] Again federal judges in Hawaii, Maryland and Virginia blocked its implementation.[477] On June 26, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the lower courts and allowed most provisions of the revised executive order to take effect. The Supreme Court ruled that Trump’s ban can be enforced on visitors from targeted countries who lack a “credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.”[478] The court scheduled full hearings in October.[478]</p>\n <p>On September 24, 2017 the temporary executive order, which was close to expiry, was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea, Chad, and Venezuela (only on certain government officials and their families).[479] These provisions were slated to take effect on October 18,[479] and the Supreme Court cancelled the hearing that was planned for October 10.[480] On October 17, a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the portions of these provisions applying to the six Muslim-majority countries, leaving only the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela to take effect.[481]</p>\n <p>Dismissal of James Comey<br>\n Main article: Dismissal of James Comey<br>\n On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey. He attributed the action to recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein,[482] which criticized Comey’s conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton’s emails.[483] On May 11, Trump stated that he was concerned with the ongoing “Russia thing”[484] and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[485]</p>\n <p>According to a Comey memo of a private conversation on February 14, 2017, Trump said he “hoped” Comey would drop the investigation into Michael Flynn,[486] who had been forced to resign as National Security Advisor after it was discovered that he had misled the Vice President about communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.</p>\n <p>In March and April, Trump had told Comey that the ongoing suspicions formed a “cloud” impairing his presidency,[487] and asked him to publicly state that he was not personally under investigation.[488] He also asked DNI Dan Coats and NSA Director Michael Rogers to issue statements saying there was no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.[489] Both refused, considering this an inappropriate request, although not illegal.[490] Comey eventually testified on June 8 that while he was director, the FBI investigations did not target Trump himself.[487][491] The Washington Post later reported that within days of Comey’s dismissal, the FBI started investigating whether Trump had obstructed justice.[492] Trump’s lawyer Jay Sekulow stated that he had not been notified of any such investigation.[493] ABC News later reported that the special counsel is gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice but has not launched a full-scale investigation.[494]</p>\n <p>Trump attracted attention for implying that he had “tapes” of conversations with Comey, before later stating that he did not in fact have such tapes.[495]</p>\n <p>False and misleading statements<br>\n As president, Trump has frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks.[496][497][498] Trump uttered “at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days” in office[496] and 492 total in his first 100 days in office.[497] “Fact Checker”, a political analysis column in The Washington Post, wrote: “President Trump is the most fact-challenged politician that The Fact Checker has ever encountered… the pace and volume of the president’s misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up.”[497]</p>\n <p>Domestic policy<br>\n Energy<br>\n Trump’s energy policy advocates domestic industrial support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter.[499] His appointed advisers favor a less regulated energy market and, because they do not consider climate change a threat, see no need for immediate action.[500]</p>\n <p>Climate change<br>\n Main article: Environmental policy under the Trump administration<br>\n Trump does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.[501][502] In 2012, he said that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese, but later said that he was joking.[503][504] He has called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a “disgrace” and has threatened to cut its budget.[505] Trump pledged to eliminate the Clean Power Plan[506] and withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which calls for reductions in carbon emissions in more than 170 countries.[507] After winning the presidency, Trump said he had an “open mind” towards the Paris agreement,[508] but on June 1, 2017, he announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, making the United States one of only three nations at the time, besides Syria and Nicaragua, not to be members.[509]</p>\n <p>Immigration<br>\n Main article: Immigration policy of Donald Trump</p>\n <p>Trump conferring with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly, January 25, 2017<br>\n Trump’s immigration policies were intensely discussed during the campaign. Trump vowed to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico–United States border to keep out illegal immigrants, a wall that Trump promised Mexico would pay for.[510][511][512] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[513] and criticized birthright citizenship as it creates “anchor babies”.[514] He said the focus of deportation would be criminals, those who have overstayed their visas, and other “security threats”.[515]</p>\n <p>Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to completely ban Muslim non-citizens from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[516][517][518] Later in 2016 he stated that the ban would apply only to people originating from countries with a “proven history of terrorism against the United States or its allies”, or countries “compromised by terrorism”.[519][520][521]</p>\n <p>Shortly after coming into office, Trump issued a limited travel ban, which was suspended by federal courts and eventually came into effect following a June 2017 Supreme Court decision.[478]</p>\n <p>Social issues<br>\n Main article: Social policy of Donald Trump<br>\n Trump is conservative, describes himself as pro-life, and generally opposes abortion; exceptions are made in cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[522] He has said that he is committed to appointing justices who would try to overturn the ruling in Roe v. Wade.[523] He personally supports “traditional marriage”[503] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a “settled” issue.[523]</p>\n <p>Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[524][525] although his views have shifted over time.[526] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[527] He favors capital punishment,[528][529] as well as the use of waterboarding.[530][531]</p>\n <p>Health care<br>\n In 1999, Trump told Larry King Live that “I believe in universal healthcare.”[532] Trump’s 2000 book, The America We Deserve, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model,[533] and has voiced admiration for the Scottish National Health Service.[532][534][535]</p>\n <p>As a candidate Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare.[536][537] Starting early in his presidency he urged Congress to repeal and replace it. In May the United States House of Representatives voted to repeal the ACA.[538] However, the Senate tried for several months but was unable to pass any of several versions of a repeal bill.[539] Trump has expressed a desire to “let Obamacare fail”, and the Trump administration has cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[540][541][542]</p>\n <p>Trump aims to streamline the Department of Veterans Affairs, getting rid of backlogs and waitlists, and upgrading relevant facilities.[543] On his first Monday in office, Trump issued a federal hiring freeze on the VA.[544]</p>\n <p>Education<br>\n Trump has stated his support for school choice and local control for primary and secondary schools.[545] He opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative for primary and secondary schools,[546] and has called it “a disaster” that must be ended.[547] He has stated he would abolish all or part of the Department of Education.[548]</p>\n <p>Economy and trade<br>\n Main article: Economic policy of Donald Trump</p>\n <p>Trump speaking to auto workers in Michigan in March 2017<br>\n Trump’s campaign tax plan called for levelling the corporate tax rate to 15%, eliminating various business loopholes and deductions,[371] and reducing the number of brackets for personal income tax: the top rate would be reduced from 39.6% to 25%, a large “zero bracket” would be created, and the alternative minimum tax and estate tax (which currently applies to individual estates over $5.45 million or $10.9 million per married couple) would both be eliminated.[549] His comments about the minimum wage have been inconsistent.[550][551][552]</p>\n <p>Trump identifies as a “free trader”, but says that trade must be “reasonably fair”.[553] He has often been called a “protectionist”,[554][555][556] because of his criticism of NAFTA,[557][558] the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),[559] and his proposal to significantly raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States.[560][561] He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted.[562][563] However, Trump has been very keen to support a “fair” post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom,[564] which Trump says would be “good for both sides”.[565]</p>\n <p>Government size and deregulation<br>\n Trump’s early policies have favored deregulation and a smaller federal government. He became the first president in sixteen years to sign a Congressional Review Act disapproval resolution; the law had been used only once before.[566] During his first six weeks in office, he abolished ninety federal regulations.[567][568]</p>\n <p>On January 23, 2017, Trump ordered a temporary government-wide hiring freeze, which allows for exceptions, primarily for jobs deemed vital for national security or public safety reasons.[569][570] The Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office told a House committee that hiring freezes have not proven to be effective in reducing costs.[571] Unlike some past freezes, the current freeze bars agencies from adding contractors to make up for employees leaving.[571]</p>\n <p>A week later Trump signed Executive Order 13771, directing administrative agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation they issue.[572][573] Harvard Law professor Jody Freeman said that the order would do no more than slow the regulatory process, because it did not block rules required by statute.[574]</p>\n <p>On February 24, 2017, Trump ordered the agencies to create task forces to determine which regulations are deemed burdensome to the U.S. economy.[575] Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump’s criticisms, saying that the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups.[576]</p>\n <p>Foreign policy<br>\n Main articles: Foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration and Foreign policy of Donald Trump</p>\n <p>President Trump together with other leaders at the 43rd G7 summit in Italy, May 2017<br>\n Trump has been described as non-interventionist[577][578] and nationalist.[579] He repeatedly stated that he supports “America First” foreign policy.[580] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[579] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[581] He says America should look inward, stop “nation building”, and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[578] As a candidate he questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[582] and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[583] But as president he has reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to NATO.[584]</p>\n <p>In order to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Trump in 2015 called for seizing the oil in ISIS-occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops.[585] In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region,[586][587] a position he later retracted.[588] Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is “a big fan of Israel”.[589] During the campaign he said he would relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from its current location, Tel Aviv, although he has not pursued that proposal as president.[590] On May 22, 2017, Trump was the first U.S. president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem, during his first foreign trip, visiting Israel, Italy, the Vatican, and Belgium.[591]</p>\n <p>Both as a candidate and as president, Trump repeatedly said he wants a good relationship with Russia.[592][593] Trump has pledged to hold a summit meeting with Vladimir Putin.[594] He added that Russia could help the U.S. in fighting ISIS militants.[595] On April 7, 2017, Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian airfield in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[596]</p>\n <p>North Korea became a major issue in mid-2017. During the campaign and the early months of his presidency, Trump had hoped that China would help to rein in North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and missile tests.[597] However, North Korea accelerated its missile testing, leading to an increase in tensions in April 2017.[597] In July, the country tested two long-range missiles identified by Western observers as intercontinental ballistic missiles, potentially capable of reaching Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland.[598][599] In August, Trump dramatically escalated his rhetoric against North Korea, warning that further provocation against the U.S. will be met with “fire and fury like the world has never seen.”[600] North Korean leader Kim Jong-un then threatened to direct the country’s next missile test toward Guam. Trump responded that if North Korea took steps to attack Guam, “[t]hings [would] happen to them like they never thought possible.”[601]</p>\n <p>Impeachment efforts<br>\n Main article: Efforts to impeach Donald Trump<br>\n On July 12, 2017, California Representative Brad Sherman formally introduced an article of impeachment, H.

Raised largely in Hawaii, Obama also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.</p>\n <p>During his first two years in office, Obama signed many landmark bills. Main reforms were the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as “Obamacare”, shortened as the “Affordable Care Act”, or abbreviated as the ACA), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession, but the GOP regained control of the House of Representatives in 2011. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.</p>\n <p>After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating. He currently resides in Washington, D.C. His presidential library will be built in Chicago.</p>\n <p>Contents<br>\n Early life and career</p>\n <p>Main article: Early life and career of Barack Obama<br>\n Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[3] at Kapiʻolani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii.[4][5][6] He is the first President to have been born in Hawaii,[7] making him the first President born outside of the contiguous 48 states.[8] He was born to a white mother and a black father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, of mostly English descent,[9] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.[10] His father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982), was a married Luo Kenyan man from Nyang’oma Kogelo. Obama’s parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on scholarship.[11][12] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[13][14]</p>\n <p>In late August 1961, Obama’s mother moved with him to the University of Washington in Seattle for a year. During that time, Obama Sr. completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii in June 1962, then left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama’s parents divorced in March 1964.[15] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time. He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas time in 1971,[16] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[17] Of his early childhood, Obama recalled, “That my father looked nothing like the people around me – that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk – barely registered in my mind.”[12] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[18]</p>\n <p>In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography at the University of Hawaii, and the couple were married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[19] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966, followed sixteen months later by his wife and stepson in 1967, with the family initially living in a Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet subdistrict of south Jakarta, then from 1970 in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng subdistrict of central Jakarta.[20]</p>\n <p>Education<br>\n From age six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (Besuki Public School) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[21][22] During his time in Indonesia, Obama’s step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him “a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works”.[23]</p>\n <p>Obama returned to Honolulu in 1971 to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School— a private college preparatory school— with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until his graduation from high school in 1979.[24] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname “Barry”.[25] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[26] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[27] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian cancer and uterine cancer.[28]</p>\n <p>Reflecting later on his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: “The opportunity that Hawaii offered – to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect – became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.”[29] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to “push questions of who I was out of my mind”.[30] Obama was also a member of the “choom gang”, a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.[31][32]</p>\n <p>After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation’s policy of apartheid.[33] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks.[33] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[34] and in English literature[35] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[36] He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,[37][38] then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.[39][40][41]</p>\n <p>Family and personal life<br>\n Main article: Family of Barack Obama</p>\n <p>Obama posing in the Green Room of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia in 2009<br>\n In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: “It’s like a little mini-United Nations”, he said. “I’ve got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I’ve got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.”[42] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng, the daughter of his mother and her Indonesian second husband) and seven half-siblings from his Kenyan father’s family—six of them living.[43] Obama’s mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,[44] until her death on November 2, 2008,[45] two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[46] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother’s family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.[47]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Obama with Jonathan Toews and the Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks in 2010<br>\n Besides his native English, Obama speaks some basic Indonesian, having learned the language during his four childhood years in Jakarta.[48][49] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school’s varsity team;[50] he is left-handed.[51]</p>\n <p>Obama about to take a shot while three other players look at him. One of those players attempts to block Obama.<br>\n Obama taking a left-handed jump shot during a pick-up game on the White House basketball court, 2009<br>\n Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.[52] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.[53] He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as President.[54] In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[55]</p>\n <p>Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.[56] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.[56][57] The relationship was only made public in May 2017, several months after Obama’s two-term presidency had ended.[57]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Obama and his wife Michelle at the Civil Rights Summit at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2014<br>\n In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin.[58] Assigned for three months as Obama’s adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at several group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date.[59] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[60] The couple’s first daughter, Malia Ann, was born on July 4, 1998,[61] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (“Sasha”), on June 10, 2001.[62] The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School.[63] The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[64] In August 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[65]</p>\n <p>Applying the proceeds of a book deal, the family moved in 2005 from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago.[66] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko’s subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[67]</p>\n <p>In December 2007, Money estimated the Obama family’s net worth at $1.3 million.[68] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.[69][70] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans’ families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[71][72] As per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.[73]</p>\n <p>In reference to Obama’s smoking habit, Michelle said in early 2010 that he had quit smoking.[74][75]</p>\n <p>On his 55th birthday, August 4, 2016, Obama penned an essay in Glamour describing how his daughters and being president have made him a feminist.[76][77][78]</p>\n <p>Religious views</p>\n <p>The Obamas worship at African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., January 2013<br>\n Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[79] He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he “was not raised in a religious household”. He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet “in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known.” He described his father as a “confirmed atheist” by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as “a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.” Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand “the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.”[80]</p>\n <p>In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: “I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.”[81] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying “I’m a Christian by choice. My family didn’t – frankly, they weren’t folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn’t raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – being my brothers’ and sisters’ keeper, treating others as they would treat me.”[82][83]</p>\n <p>Obama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright in October 1987, and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[84] He resigned from Trinity in May 2008 during his first presidential campaign after some of Wright’s statements were criticized.[85] The Obama family has attended several Protestant churches since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John’s Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but are not habitual church-goers.[86][87][88]</p>\n <p>Law career<br>\n Community organizer and Harvard Law School<br>\n Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama was hired in Chicago as director of the Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago’s South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[40][89] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants’ rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.[90] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.[91] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.[92][93]</p>\n <p>External video<br>\n Derrick Bell threatens to leave Harvard, April 24, 1990, 11:34, Boston TV Digital Archive[94] Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25<br>\n Obama entered Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts.[95] He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,[96] president of the journal in his second year,[90][97] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.[98] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as an associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins &amp; Sutter in 1990.[99] After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude[100] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.[96] Obama’s election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention[90][97] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[101] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[101]</p>\n <p>Chicago Law School and civil rights attorney<br>\n In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.[101][102] He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[103]</p>\n <p>From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois’s Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain’s Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of “40 under Forty” powers to be.[104]</p>\n <p>He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.).[105] This class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.[106] The case was settled out of court.[107] Final Judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.[108] His law license became inactive in 2007.[109][110]</p>\n <p>From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago, which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project, and of the Joyce Foundation.[40] He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[40]</p>\n <p>Legislative career<br>\n Illinois State Senator (1997–2004)<br>\n Main article: Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama</p>\n <p>State Senator Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after ShoreBank co-founder Milton Davis in 1998<br>\n Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois’s 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park–Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn.[111] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.[112] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.[113] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan’s payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.[114]</p>\n <p>He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.[115] In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois’s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.[116]</p>\n <p>In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate’s Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[117] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.[113][118] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.[119] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.[120]</p>\n <p>2004 U.S. Senate campaign<br>\n Main article: United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004</p>\n <p>County results of the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois.

He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002.

His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.[130]</p>\n <p>Obama’s expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.[131] Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.[132] In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70% of the vote.[133]</p>\n <p>U.S. Senator from Illinois (2005–08)<br>\n Main article: United States Senate career of Barack Obama</p>\n <p>The official portrait of Obama as a member of the United States Senate<br>\n Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,[134] becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus.[135] CQ Weekly characterized him as a “loyal Democrat” based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007.

The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.[161] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[162]</p>\n <p>Photograph<br>\n President George W.

In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.[190] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,[191] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds[192][193][194] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.[195] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.[196] He also revoked President George W.

He nominated Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009 to replace retiring Associate Justice David Souter; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009,[201] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of Hispanic descent.[202] Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history.[203]</p>\n <p>On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a reconciliation bill that ended the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increased the Pell Grant scholarship award, and made changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[204][205]</p>\n <p>In a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station.[206]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Obama meets with the Cabinet, November 23, 2009<br>\n President Obama’s 2011 State of the Union Address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally. He spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, banning congressional earmarks, and reducing healthcare costs. He promised that the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and would be 80% reliant on “clean” electricity.[207][208]</p>\n <p>LGBT rights<br>\n On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim’s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[209]</p>\n <p>On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV, which was celebrated by Immigration Equality.[210]</p>\n <p>On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign[211][212] to end the Don’t ask, don’t tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces.[213] In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that also barred transgender people from serving openly in the military.[214]</p>\n <p>As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said that he favored legalizing same-sex marriage.[215] By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said that he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners, but he opposed same-sex marriages for strategic reasons.[216] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[217][218]</p>\n <p>During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013,[189] Obama became the first president to call for full equality for gay Americans: “Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law – for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.” This was the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word “gay” in an inaugural address.[219][220]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>The White House was illuminated in rainbow colors on the evening of the Supreme Court same-sex marriage ruling, June 26, 2015.<br>\n In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage)[221] and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).[222] Then, following the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (ruling same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right), Obama asserted that, “This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free.”[223]</p>\n <p>On July 30, 2015 the White House Office of National AIDS Policy revised its strategy for addressing the ailment, which included widespread testing and linkage to healthcare, which was celebrated by the Human Rights Campaign.[224]</p>\n <p>White House advisory and oversight groups<br>\n On March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which forms part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.[225] The Council is currently chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett.[226] Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through an official United States government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.[226][227][228] The current co-chairs of the Task Force are Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett.[227] The Task Force has been a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that, the 1994 Violence Against Women Act that was first drafted by Biden.[229]</p>\n <p>Economic policy<br>\n Main article: Economic policy of the Barack Obama administration<br>\n File:20090124 WeeklyAddress.ogvPlay media<br>\n Obama presents his first weekly address as President of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009<br>\n On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.[230] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.[231]</p>\n <p>In March, Obama’s Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.[232] Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry[233] in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms’ bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat[234] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.[235] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[236] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as “Cash for Clunkers”, that temporarily boosted the economy.[237][238][239]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Deficit and debt increases, 2001–16<br>\n Spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department authorized by the Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion was spent by the end of November 2009.[240] Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5 trillion or 10.6% of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion or 9.9% of GDP.[241][242] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will shrink to $1.34 trillion, and the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53 trillion or 90% of GDP.[243] The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2 trillion took effect in February 2014.[244] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation’s debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.[245] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[246]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>US employment statistics (unemployment rate and monthly changes in net employment) during Obama’s tenure as U.S. President[247][248]<br>\n As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[249] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[250] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,[251] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.[252] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.[253] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.[254] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[254] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was “unusually uncertain”.[255] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.[256]</p>\n <p>The Congressional Budget Office and a broad range of economists credit Obama’s stimulus plan for economic growth.[257][258] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million,[258][259][260][261] while conceding that “It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.”[257] Although an April 2010 survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[262] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II.[263] The OECD credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus in the United States and the austerity measures in the European Union.[264]</p>\n <p>Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes.[265] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[266]</p>\n <p>In December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a “defining challenge of our time” and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis’ criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics.[267]</p>\n <p>Obama has urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[268]</p>\n <p>Environmental policy<br>\n See also: Climate change policy of the United States</p>\n <p>Obama at a 2010 briefing on the BP oil spill at the Coast Guard Station Venice in Venice, Louisiana<br>\n On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb global warming.[269][270]</p>\n <p>On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[271] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[272]</p>\n <p>In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and stated he “would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution” or “greenhouse emissions”.[273][274] Obama’s advisers called for a halt to petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.[275] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would authorize the pipeline.[276] It was the third veto of Obama’s presidency and his first major veto.[277]</p>\n <p>Obama has emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.[278]</p>\n <p>Health care reform<br>\n Main article: Health care reform in the United States<br>\n Photograph<br>\n Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010<br>\n Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[279] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.[280][281]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and federal poverty level, under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 (Source: CRS)[282]<br>\n On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[279] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[283] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[284]</p>\n <p>On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[285][286] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.[287] On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.[288] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.[289]</p>\n <p>The ACA includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,[290] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400% of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum “out-of-pocket” payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,[291][292] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and Congressional Budget Office figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.[291][293]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (Source: JAMA)[294]<br>\n The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[295] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[296] In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.[297]</p>\n <p>The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress’s taxing authority.[298] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that “closely-held” for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in King v.

In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.[300] Obama’s approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation’s available energy resources.[301][302]</p>\n <p>Gun control<br>\n Main article: Social policy of the Barack Obama administration § Gun policy</p>\n <p>Obama visiting 2012 Aurora shooting victims at University of Colorado Hospital<br>\n On January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control.[303] He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.[304] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.[305] In a 2016 editorial in the New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed “common-sense gun reform” to women’s suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history.[306]</p>\n <p>2010 midterm elections<br>\n Main articles: United States House of Representatives elections, 2010 and United States Senate elections, 2010<br>\n Obama called the November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,[307] “humbling” and a “shellacking”.[308] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.[309]</p>\n <p>Cybersecurity and Internet policy<br>\n On November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the Federal Communications Commission reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[310][311] On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed Executive Order 13636, “Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity”.[312]</p>\n <p>Foreign policy<br>\n Main article: Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration<br>\n President Obama stands at a podium delivering a speech on “A New Beginning” at Cairo University on June 4, 2009<br>\n Obama speaking on “A New Beginning” at Cairo University on June 4, 2009</p>\n <p>International trips made by President Barack Obama during his terms in office</p>\n <p>Obama visiting the Rijksmuseum with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, 2014<br>\n In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a “new era” in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms “break” and “reset” to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[313] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab cable TV network, Al Arabiya.[314]</p>\n <p>On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year’s video message to the people and government of Iran.[315][316] In April, Obama gave a speech in Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.[317] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for “A New Beginning” in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[318]</p>\n <p>On June 26, 2009, Obama responded to the Iranian government’s actions towards protesters following Iran’s 2009 presidential election by saying: “The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.”[319] While in Moscow on July 7, he responded Vice President Biden’s comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: “We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.”[320]</p>\n <p>On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. President to preside over a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.[321]</p>\n <p>In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.[322][323] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about one-third.[324] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[325]</p>\n <p>In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[326] He criticized Russia’s law discriminating against gays in August 2013,[327] stopping short of advocating a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, Russia.[328]</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Obama meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi at the White House, October 2016<br>\n In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to normalize relationships between Cuba and the United States.[329] The countries’ respective “interests sections” in one another’s capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015.</p>\n <p>In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a “Joint Planning Cell” with Saudi Arabia.[330]</p>\n <p>Before leaving office, Obama said German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been his “closest international partner” throughout his tenure as President.[331]</p>\n <p>War in Iraq<br>\n Main articles: Iraq War and American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)<br>\n On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months.

McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal’s Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.[346] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;[347] this took place in July 2011.

He said that both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples.

They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution[365] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[366] In response to the unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to “show no mercy” to the rebels of Benghazi[367]—announced an immediate cessation of military activities,[368] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling Misrata. The next day, on Obama’s orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government’s air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[369] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[370][371][372] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all of its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[373] Some Representatives[374] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[375][376]</p>\n <p>Syrian Civil War<br>\n See also: Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War § United States<br>\n On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: “The time has come for President Assad to step aside.”[377][378] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.[379] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.[380] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.[381][382]</p>\n <p>In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the “red line” he had pledged[383] and, rather than authorise the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued.[384][385] In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL, but repeatedly promised that the U.S. would not deploy ground troops in Syria.[386][387]</p>\n <p>Death of Osama bin Laden<br>\n Main article: Death of Osama bin Laden<br>\n File:President Obama on Death of Osama bin Laden.ogvPlay media<br>\n President Obama’s address (9:28)<br>\n Also available: Audio only; Full text Wikisource has information on “Remarks by the President on Osama bin Laden”<br>\n President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on Operation Neptune’s Spear, a mission against Osama bin Laden, in one of the conference rooms of the Situation Room of the White House, on May 1, 2011.

He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad.[388] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[388] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a “surgical raid” to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[388] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[389][390] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden’s corpse,[391] which was buried at sea several hours later.[392] Within minutes of the President’s announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City’s Ground Zero and Times Square.[389][393] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W.

The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim’s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.</p>\n <p>In 2010, President Obama signed into effect the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007–08, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[476]</p>\n <p>As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.[477] In 2010, Obama signed the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGB people; the law went into effect the following year.[478] In 2016, the Obama administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the US armed forces.[479][214] A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama’s term, showed that 68% of Americans believed that the U.S. had made progress in the situation for gays and lesbians during Obama’s eight years in office.[480]</p>\n <p>President Obama continued the drone strikes that President George W. Bush started during his presidency in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen. Obama also ordered drone strikes in Libya in 2011, the Philippines in 2012, and Syria in 2014.[481] Obama left about 9,800 US troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 US troops in Iraq, 503 US troops in Syria, 133 US troops in Pakistan, 106 US troops in Somalia, 7 US troops in Yemen, and 2 US troops in Libya at the end of his presidency.[482][483]</p>\n <p>According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2015, that inmates sentenced in US federal custody declined by 5% under US President Obama. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in US federal custody since Democrat US President Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under US presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.[484]</p>\n <p>Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.[485][486] A 2017 C-SPAN Presidential Historians Survey ranked Obama as the 12th best US president.[487][488]</p>\n <p>Books written</p>\n <p>Dreams from My Father, 1995<br>\n The Audacity of Hope, 2006<br>\n Of Thee I Sing, 2010<br>\n Audiobooks<br>\n 2006: The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream (read by the author), Random House Audio, ISBN 978-0-7393-6641-7</p>\n <p>© The Aryan Yadav Foundation ®</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Special thanks to : Sir Barack Obama</p>\n <p>Anjali Shristav ( Google AAD )</p>\n <p>Diva Gandhi</p>\n <p>and My Parents</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>– Aryan Yadav</p>\n <p>CEO The Aryan Yadav Foundation ®</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p> </p>\n <p> </p>\n <p> </p>\n <p> </p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>You are still here ???</p>\n <p>Read another article </p>\n </div>\n <!-- .entry-content --> </article><!-- #post-## --> <article id=post-41 class=\"post-41 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-non-profit\"> <header class=entry-header> <h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/41/ rel=bookmark target=_blank>Ellen DeGeneres</a></h1> <div class=entry-meta> <span class=posted-on><a href=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/41/ rel=bookmark target=_blank><time class=\"entry-date published\" datetime=2017-10-18T10:38:12+00:00>October 18, 2017</time><time class=updated datetime=2017-10-18T10:40:47+00:00>October 18, 2017</time></a></span><span class=byline><span class=sep> / </span><span class=\"author vcard\"><a class=\"url fn n\" href=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.wordpress.com/author/thearyanyadavfoundation/ target=_blank>The Aryan Yadav Foundation (ARYF)</a></span></span> <span class=comments-link><span class=sep> / </span><a href=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/41/#respond target=_blank>Leave a comment</a></span> </div>\n <!-- .entry-meta --> </header><!-- .entry-header --> <div class=entry-content> <p><img data-attachment-id=44 data-permalink=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/41/img_1005/ data-orig-file=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_1005.jpg data-orig-size=314,468 data-comments-opened=1 data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}' data-image-title=img_1005 data-image-description data-medium-file=\"https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_1005.jpg?w=201\" data-large-file=\"https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_1005.jpg?w=314\" src=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_1005.jpg?w=314&h=468\" height=468 class=wp-image-44 width=314 srcset=\"https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_1005.jpg 314w, https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.wordpress.com/author/thearyanyadavfoundation/page/2/ https:/thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_1005.jpg?w=101&h=150 101w, https://sandbox.copyleaks.com/?url=https://thearyanyadavfoundationblog.wordpress.com/author/thearyanyadavfoundation/page/2/ https:/thearyanyadavfoundationblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_1005.jpg?w=201&h=300 201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\"></p>\n <p>Ellen Lee DeGeneres (/dɪˈdʒɛnərɪs/; born January 26, 1958)[2] is an American comedian, television host, actress, writer, and producer.[3] DeGeneres starred in the popular sitcom Ellen from 1994 to 1998 and has hosted her syndicated TV talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, since 2003.</p>\n <p>Ellen DeGeneres<br>\n Ellen DeGeneres 2011.jpg<br>\n Ellen DeGeneres in Los Angeles, California, on October 10, 2011<br>\n Birth name Ellen Lee DeGeneres<br>\n Born January 26, 1958 (age 59)<br>\n Metairie, Louisiana, U.S.<br>\n Medium Stand-up comedy, television, film, book<br>\n Alma mater University of New Orleans<br>\n Years active 1978–present<br>\n Genres Observational comedy, satire, surreal humor, anti-humor, deadpan<br>\n Subject(s) American culture, pop culture, sexuality, current events<br>\n Spouse Portia de Rossi (m. 2008)<br>\n Partner(s) Anne Heche (1997–2000)<br>\n Alexandra Hedison (2001–04)<br>\n Parent(s) Elliott DeGeneres<br>\n Betty DeGeneres<br>\n Relative(s) Vance DeGeneres (brother)<br>\n Her stand-up career started in the early 1980s, and included a 1986 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

During the fourth season of Ellen in 1997, she came out as a lesbian in an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Her character, Ellen Morgan, also came out to a therapist played by Winfrey, and the series went on to explore various LGBT issues, including the coming-out process. This made her the first openly lesbian actress to play an openly lesbian character on television.[4] In 2008, she married her longtime girlfriend Portia de Rossi.</p>\n <p>DeGeneres has hosted the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, and the Primetime Emmys. She has authored four books and started her own record company, Eleveneleven, as well as a production company, A Very Good Production. She also launched a lifestyle brand, ED by Ellen.

In 2016, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[6]</p>\n <p>Early life and education</p>\n <p>DeGeneres was born and raised in Metairie, Louisiana, the daughter of Betty DeGeneres (née Elizabeth Jane Pfeffer), a speech therapist, and Elliott Everett DeGeneres, an insurance agent.[2][7] She has one brother, Vance, a musician and producer. She is of French, English, German, and Irish descent. She was raised as a Christian Scientist until age 13.[citation needed] In 1973, her parents filed for separation and were divorced the following year. Shortly after, Ellen’s mother married Roy Gruessendorf, a salesman. Betty Jane and Ellen moved with Gruessendorf from the New Orleans area to Atlanta, Texas. Vance stayed with his father. On a February 2011 episode of her show, she told her studio audience of a letter from the New England Historic Genealogical Society confirming she is 15th cousin to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge via their shared common ancestor Thomas Fairfax.[8][9]</p>\n <p>DeGeneres graduated from Atlanta High School in May 1976, after completing her first years of high school at Grace King High School in Metairie, Louisiana. She moved back to New Orleans to attend the University of New Orleans, where she majored in communication studies. After one semester, she left school to do clerical work in a law firm with a cousin, Laura Gillen. Her early jobs included working at J. C. Penney,[10] and being a waitress at T.G.I. Friday’s and another restaurant, a house painter, a hostess, and a bartender. She relates much of her childhood and career experiences in her comedic work.</p>\n <p>Stand-up comedy</p>\n <p>DeGeneres started performing stand-up comedy at small clubs and coffee houses. By 1981 she was the emcee at Clyde’s Comedy Club in New Orleans. DeGeneres cites Woody Allen and Steve Martin as her main influences at this time.[11] In the early 1980s she began to tour nationally, and in 1982 she was named Showtime’s funniest person in America in 1982.[12]</p>\n <p>Netflix<br>\n MAY 24, 2017, main article: Ellen DeGeneres Lands New Netflix Stand-Up Special Ellen DeGeneres will appear in a brand new stand up special for Netflix.</p>\n <p>“It has been 15 years since I did a stand-up special. 15 years,” DeGeneres said in a statement. “And I’m writing it now, I can’t wait. I’ll keep you posted when and where I’m gonna shoot my Netflix special. I’m excited to do it; I’m excited for you to see it.”</p>\n <p>Film career</p>\n <p>Ellen DeGeneres at the Emmy Awards, September 1997<br>\n Ellen’s work in the late 1980s and early 1990s included the film Coneheads. DeGeneres starred in a series of films for a show named Ellen’s Energy Adventure, which is part of the Universe of Energy attraction and pavilion at Walt Disney World’s Epcot. The film also featured Bill Nye, Alex Trebek, Michael Richards, and Jamie Lee Curtis. The show revolved around DeGeneres’ falling asleep and finding herself in an energy-themed version of Jeopardy!, playing against an old rival, portrayed by Curtis, and Albert Einstein. The next film had DeGeneres co-hosting an educational look at energy with Nye. The ride first opened on September 15, 1996, as Ellen’s Energy Crisis, but was quickly given the more positive-sounding name Ellen’s Energy Adventure.</p>\n <p>Television career</p>\n <p>DeGeneres’s first regular TV role was in a short-lived Fox sitcom called Open House. She played the role of Margo Van Meter, an office worker at the Juan Verde Real Estate company. The show co-starred Alison LaPlaca and Mary Page Keller. In 1992, producers Neal Marlens and Carol Black cast DeGeneres in their sitcom Laurie Hill, in the role of Nurse Nancy MacIntyre. The series was canceled after only four episodes, but Marlens and Black were so impressed with DeGeneres’ performance that they soon cast her in their next ABC pilot, These Friends of Mine, which they co-created with David S. Rosenthal.</p>\n <p>At the Governor’s Ball after the 46th Annual Emmy Awards telecast, September 1994<br>\n DeGeneres’s comedy career became the basis of the successful sitcom Ellen, named These Friends of Mine during its first season. The ABC show was popular in its first few seasons due in part to DeGeneres’s style of observational humor; it was often referred to as a “female Seinfeld.”[13]</p>\n <p>Ellen reached its height of popularity in April 1997, when DeGeneres came out as a lesbian on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Her character on the sitcom also came out of the closet to her therapist, played by Oprah Winfrey.[14] The coming-out episode, titled “The Puppy Episode”, was one of the highest-rated episodes of the show. The series returned for a fifth season but experienced falling ratings due to ABC’s cutting back on promoting the show.[citation needed] It was believed that The Walt Disney Company, ABC’s parent owner, had become uncomfortable with the subject matter depicted on the show now that DeGeneres’ character was openly gay.[citation needed] In May 1998, Ellen was canceled. DeGeneres returned to stand-up comedy and later re-established herself as a successful talk show host.</p>\n <p>DeGeneres returned to television in 2001 with a new CBS sitcom, The Ellen Show. DeGeneres launched a daytime television talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, in September 2003. One of several celebrity-hosted talk shows surfacing at the beginning of that season, including those of Sharon Osbourne and Rita Rudner, her show has consistently risen in the Nielsen ratings and received widespread critical praise. It was nominated for 11 Daytime Emmy Awards in its first season, winning four, including Best Talk Show. The show has won 25 Emmy Awards for its first three seasons on the air. DeGeneres is known for her dancing and singing with the audience at the beginning of the show and during commercial breaks. She often gives away free prizes and trips to be in her show’s studio audience with the help of her sponsors.</p>\n <p>DeGeneres celebrated her thirty-year class reunion by flying her graduating class to California to be guests on her show in February 2006. She presented Atlanta High School with a surprise gift of a new electronic LED marquee sign. In May 2006, DeGeneres made a surprise appearance at the Tulane University commencement in New Orleans. Following George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton to the podium, she came out in a bathrobe and furry slippers. “They told me everyone would be wearing robes,” she said. Ellen then went on to make another commencement speech at Tulane in 2009.[15]</p>\n <p>The show broadcast for a week from Universal Studios Orlando in March 2007. Skits included DeGeneres going on the Hulk Roller Coaster Ride and the Jaws Boat Ride. In May 2007, DeGeneres was placed on bed rest due to a torn ligament in her back. She continued hosting her show from a hospital bed, tended to by a nurse, explaining “the show must go on, as they say.” Guests sat in hospital beds as well. On May 1, 2009, DeGeneres celebrated her 1000th episode, featuring celebrity guests such as Oprah Winfrey, Justin Timberlake, and Paris Hilton, among others.[citation needed]</p>\n <p>DeGeneres attending Oprah Winfrey’s 50th birthday party in Los Angeles, California, in January 2004<br>\n On September 9, 2009, it was confirmed that DeGeneres would replace Paula Abdul as a judge of the ninth season of American Idol. Her role started after the contestant auditions, at the beginning of “Hollywood Week”.[16][17] It is reported that DeGeneres also signed a contract to be a judge on the show for at least five seasons.[18] She made her American Idol debut on February 9, 2010. However, on July 29, 2010, DeGeneres and Fox executives announced that the comedian would be leaving American Idol after one season. In a statement, DeGeneres said that the series “didn’t feel like the right fit for me”.[19]</p>\n <p>Award shows</p>\n <p>DeGeneres received wide exposure on November 4, 2001, when she hosted the televised broadcast of the Emmy Awards. Presented after two cancellations due to network concerns that a lavish ceremony following the September 11 attacks would appear insensitive, the show required a more somber tone that would also allow viewers to temporarily forget the tragedy. DeGeneres received several standing ovations for her performance that evening, which included the line: “What would bug the Taliban more than seeing a gay woman in a suit surrounded by Jews?”</p>\n <p>In August 2005, DeGeneres hosted the 2005 Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony held on September 18, 2005. This was three weeks after Hurricane Katrina, making it the second time she hosted the Emmys following a national tragedy. She also hosted the Grammy Awards in 1996 and in 1997.</p>\n <p>On September 7, 2006, DeGeneres was selected to host the 79th Academy Awards ceremony, which took place on February 25, 2007.[20] This makes her the first openly gay or lesbian person to have hosted the event. During the Awards show, DeGeneres said, “What a wonderful night, such diversity in the room, in a year when there’s been so many negative things said about people’s race, religion, and sexual orientation. And I want to put this out there: If there weren’t blacks, Jews and gays, there would be no Oscars, or anyone named Oscar, when you think about that.”[21] Reviews of her hosting gig were positive, with one saying, “DeGeneres rocked, as she never forgot that she wasn’t just there to entertain the Oscar nominees but also to tickle the audience at home.”[22] Regis Philbin said in an interview that “the only complaint was there’s not enough Ellen.”</p>\n <p>DeGeneres was nominated for an Emmy Award as host of the Academy Awards broadcast.[23] On August 2, 2013, it was announced that DeGeneres would host the Academy Awards on March 2, 2014, for the second time.[24]</p>\n <p>A selfie orchestrated by 86th Academy Awards host Ellen DeGeneres during the broadcast is the second-most retweeted tweet ever.[25][26] DeGeneres said she wanted to homage Meryl Streep’s record 17 Oscar nominations by setting a new record with her, and invited other Oscar celebrities to join them. The resulting photo of twelve celebrities broke the previous retweet record within forty minutes and was retweeted over 1.8 million times in the first hour.[27][28][29] By the end of the ceremony it had been retweeted over 2 million times, less than 24 hours later, it had been retweeted over 2.8 million times.[26][27] As of May 2017, it has been retweeted over 3.4 million times.[26] The group selfie effort was parodied by Lego and Matt Groening with The Simpsons.[30][31] It beat the previous record, which was held by Barack Obama, following his victory in the 2012 presidential election.[29][32][33]</p>\n <p>Other ventures</p>\n <p>At Tulane University in 2009<br>\n Voice acting<br>\n DeGeneres lent her voice to the role of Dory, a friendly fish with short-term memory loss, in the 2003 animated Disney/Pixar film Finding Nemo.[34] The film’s director, Andrew Stanton, said that he chose Ellen because she changed the subject five times before one sentence had finished on her show.[35] For her performance as Dory, DeGeneres won the Saturn Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films for Best Supporting Actress; Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie from the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards; and the Annie Award from the International Animated Film Association, for Outstanding Voice Acting. She was also nominated for a Chicago Film Critics Association Award in the Best Supporting Actress category. She also provided the voice of the dog in the prologue of the Eddie Murphy feature film Dr. Dolittle. Her win of the Saturn Award marked the first and only time the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films has given the acting award for a voice performance.</p>\n <p>She reprised the role of Dory from Finding Nemo in the 2016 sequel, Finding Dory.</p>\n <p>Commercial spokesperson<br>\n In November 2004, DeGeneres appeared, dancing, in an ad campaign for American Express. Her most recent American Express commercial, a two-minute black-and-white spot in which she works with animals, debuted in November 2006 and was created by Ogilvy &amp; Mather. In 2007, the commercial won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial.</p>\n <p>DeGeneres began working with CoverGirl Cosmetics in September 2008, for which she has been criticized, as her animal-friendly values clash with Procter and Gamble’s (the maker of CoverGirl Cosmetics) animal testing.[36] Her face became the focus of CoverGirl advertisements starting in January 2009. The beauty campaign was DeGeneres’s first.[37]</p>\n <p>On December 3, 2011, DeGeneres headlined the third annual “Change Begins Within” gala for the David Lynch Foundation held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.[38][39]</p>\n <p>In spring 2012, DeGeneres became the spokesperson for J.

She explained her choice of name, claiming that she often sees the number 11:11 when looking at her clocks, that she found Greyson on the 11th, and that the singer’s soccer jersey has the number 11.[41] She mentioned that she had been looking for videos of performances on YouTube to start her label. The first act she signed to the label is Greyson Chance.[42]</p>\n <p>Ed by Ellen<br>\n Ellen launched her lifestyle brand Ed by Ellen in the summer of 2015.[43] It includes clothes, shoes, accessories, baby and home items. The PetSmart dog line was launched in February 2017[44] and a cat line was introduced later that year.[45]</p>\n <p>Personal life</p>\n <p>Forbes estimated DeGeneres’ 2017 earnings at US$77 million.[46] In 2015, she was named the 50th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes[47] and number two on the World Pride Power list.[48] By July 30, DeGeneres has more than 71 million followers on Twitter and 47 million on Instagram, making her the sixth most followed user on Twitter and the 28th most followed user on Instagram.</p>\n <p>She is a fan of the National Football League and has shown particular support for the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers.[49] In 2011, she attended a Saints practice dressed as Packers Hall of Famer Don Hutson.[50]</p>\n <p>Sexual orientation and relationships<br>\n In 1997, DeGeneres came out as lesbian. The disclosure of her sexual orientation sparked intense interest by American tabloids.[51] The contentiousness of the media coverage stunted DeGeneres’ professional career and left her “mired in depression”.[51] In her book Love, Ellen, DeGeneres’ mother, Betty DeGeneres describes being initially shocked when her daughter came out, but she has since become one of her strongest supporters; she is also an active member of Parents &amp; Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) and spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign’s Coming Out Project.</p>\n <p>The same year she came out, DeGeneres started a romantic relationship with actress Anne Heche that lasted until August 2000.[52] From 2000 to 2004, DeGeneres maintained a close affair with actress/director/photographer Alexandra Hedison.[53] The couple appeared on the cover of The Advocate after their separation had already been announced to the media.[54]</p>\n <p>Portia de Rossi and DeGeneres in September 2012<br>\n Since 2004, DeGeneres has had a relationship with Portia de Rossi.[55] After the overturn of the same-sex marriage ban in California, DeGeneres and de Rossi were engaged, and married in August 2008, at their home in Beverly Hills, California, where they live with their four dogs and three cats.[56][57] The passage of Proposition 8 cast doubt on the legal status of their marriage, but a subsequent California Supreme Court judgment validated it because it occurred before November 4, 2008.[58][59][60] On August 6, 2010, de Rossi filed a petition to legally change her name to Portia Lee James DeGeneres.[61] The petition was granted on September 23, 2010.[62]</p>\n <p>Animal rights and being a vegan<br>\n DeGeneres is a vegan. She previously described herself as a vegan and “big animal lover”.[63][64] De Rossi, too, is a vegan.[64]Ellen co-ordinates a vegan outreach website titled ‘Going Vegan with Ellen’.[65] She intended to open a vegan tapas bar, Bokado, in Los Angeles, but plans fell through.[66]</p>\n <p>The site for The Ellen DeGeneres Show contains a section called “Going Vegan With Ellen”, in which she promotes “Meatless Mondays” and features vegan recipes.[67] She has several times invited Humane Society of the United States CEO Wayne Pacelle to speak on her show about the organization’s efforts in animal protection legislation. In 2009, PETA named her their “Woman of the Year.”[68] In April 2013, she donated $25,000 to stop Ag-Gag anti-whistleblower legislation in Tennessee, which would prohibit undercover investigators from recording footage of animal abuse on farms.[69]</p>\n <p>DeGeneres served as campaign ambassador to Farm Sanctuary’s Adopt-A-Turkey Project in 2010, asking people to start “a new tradition by adopting a turkey instead of eating one” at Thanksgiving.[70]</p>\n <p>Humanitarianism<br>\n In November 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton named her a Special envoy for Global AIDS Awareness.[71] On December 3, 2011, DeGeneres opened the show at the David Lynch Foundation’s 3rd annual “Change Begins Within” gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to raise funds to bring Transcendental Meditation to at-risk populations suffering from epidemic levels of chronic stress and stress-related disorders. She says: “TM is the only time I have that stillness... it gives me this peaceful feeling, and I love it so much. I can’t say enough good things about it.

February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur, businessman, inventor, and industrial designer. Jobs was the chairman, and the chief executive officer (CEO), and a co-founder of Apple Inc.; CEO and majority shareholder of Pixar;[2] a member of The Walt Disney Company’s board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak are widely recognized as pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>\n <p>Steve Jobs<br>\n Steve Jobs Headshot 2010-CROP.jpg<br>\n Jobs showing off the iPhone 4 at the 2010 Worldwide Developers Conference<br>\n Born Steven Paul Jobs<br>\n February 24, 1955<br>\n San Francisco, California, U.S.<br>\n Died October 5, 2011 (aged 56)<br>\n Palo Alto, California, U.S.<br>\n Cause of death Pancreatic cancer<br>\n Resting place Alta Mesa Memorial Park<br>\n Education Homestead High School<br>\n Occupation<br>\n Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc.<br>\n Primary investor and CEO of Pixar<br>\n Founder and CEO of NeXT<br>\n Known for Pioneer of the personal computer revolution with Steve Wozniak<br>\n Board member of<br>\n The Walt Disney Company[1]<br>\n Apple Inc.<br>\n Spouse(s) Laurene Powell<br>\n (m. 1991)<br>\n Partner(s) Chrisann Brennan<br>\n Children 4, including Lisa<br>\n Relatives Mona Simpson (sister)<br>\n He was born in San Francisco to parents who had to put him up for adoption at birth; he was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1960s. [3] Jobs then attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out [4], and decided to travel through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism.[5] Jobs’s declassified FBI report stated that an acquaintance knew that Jobs had used marijuana (the formerly illegalized drug in California), and LSD while he was in college.[6] Jobs once told a reporter that taking LSD was “one of the two or three most important things” he did in his life.[7]</p>\n <p>Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak’s Apple I personal computer. The visionaries gained fame and wealth a year later for the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. In 1979, after a tour of PARC, Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984. In addition to being the first mass-produced computer with a GUI, the Macintosh introduced the sudden rise of the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Following a long power struggle, Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985.[8]</p>\n <p>After leaving Apple, Jobs took a few of its members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in state-of-the-art computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, Jobs helped to initiate the development of the visual effects industry when he funded the spinout of the computer graphics division of George Lucas’s Lucasfilm in 1986.[9] The new company, Pixar, would eventually produce the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story—an event made possible in part because of Jobs’s financial support.</p>\n <p>In 1997, Apple merged with NeXT. Within a few months of the merger, Jobs became CEO of his former company; he revived Apple at the verge of bankruptcy. Beginning in 1997 with the “Think different” advertising campaign, Jobs worked closely with designer Jonathan Ive to develop a line of products that would have larger cultural ramifications: the iMac, iTunes and iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new Mac OS X, based on NeXT’s NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time.</p>\n <p>Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003 and died on October 5, 2011, of respiratory arrest related to the pancreatic tumor.</p>\n <p>Contents<br>\n Background</p>\n <p>Parents<br>\n Steve Jobs’s biological parents were Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble. His adoptive parents were Paul Jobs and Clara Hagopian.</p>\n <p>His biological father, Abdulfattah “John” Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي) (b. March 15, 1931), grew up in Homs, Syria and was born into an Arab Muslim household.[10] Jandali is the son of a self-made millionaire who did not go to college and a mother who was a traditional housewife.[10] While an undergraduate at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, he was a student activist and spent time in jail for his political activities.[10] Although Jandali initially wanted to study law, he eventually decided to study economics and political science.[10] He pursued a PhD in the latter subject at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Carole Schieble (b. August 1, 1932), a Catholic of Swiss and German descent, who grew up on a farm in Wisconsin.[11][10][12] As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a teaching assistant for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age.[13] Jobs’s full biological sister (Mona Simpson), notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating Jandali: “it wasn’t that he was Middle-Eastern so much as that he was a Muslim. But there are a lot of Arabs in Michigan and Wisconsin. So it’s not that unusual.”[13] Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs’s official biographer, additionally states that Schieble’s father “threatened to cut Joanne off completely” if she continued the relationship.[11]</p>\n <p>Jobs’s adoptive father, Paul Reinhold Jobs (1922–1993), grew up in a Calvinist household,[14] the son of an “alcoholic and sometimes abusive” father.[11] The family lived on a farm in Germantown, Wisconsin.[11][14] Paul bore an ostensible resemblance to James Dean; he had tattoos, dropped out of high school, and traveled around the Midwest for several years during the 1930s looking for work.[11][14] He eventually joined the United States Coast Guard as an engine-room machinist.[14] After World War II, Paul Jobs decided to leave the Coast Guard when his ship docked in San Francisco.[14] He made a bet that he would find his wife in San Francisco and promptly went on a blind date with Clara Hagopian (1924–1986). They were engaged ten days later and married in 1946.[11] Clara, the daughter of Armenian immigrants, grew up in San Francisco and had been married before, but her husband had been killed in the war. After a series of moves, Paul and Clara settled in San Francisco’s Sunset District in 1952.[11] As a hobby, Paul Jobs rebuilt cars, but his career was as a “repo man”, which suited his “aggressive, tough personality.”[14] Meanwhile, their attempts to start a family were halted after Clara had an ectopic pregnancy, leading them to consider adoption in 1955.[11]</p>\n <p>Birth<br>\n “Of all the inventions of humans, the computer is going to rank near or at the top as history unfolds and we look back. It is the most awesome tool that we have ever invented. I feel incredibly lucky to be at exactly the right place in Silicon Valley, at exactly the right time, historically, where this invention has taken form.”<br>\n —Steve Jobs, 1995. From the documentary, Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview.[15]<br>\n Job’s biological mother Schieble became pregnant with him in 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer with his family in Homs, Syria. Jandali has stated that he “was very much in love with Joanne … but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria. And so she told me she wanted to give the baby up for adoption.”[16] Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble’s father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry.[11] In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954.[14] According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: “without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me … she did not want to bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone.”[16] Schieble put herself in the care of a “doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions.”[11]</p>\n <p>Schieble gave birth to Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco and chose an adoptive couple for him that was “Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy.”[17] The couple changed their mind, however, and decided to adopt a girl instead.[17] The baby boy was then placed with the Bay Area blue collar couple Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and Schieble refused to sign the adoption papers.[11] She then took the matter to court in an attempt to have her baby placed with a different family[17] and only consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after they promised that he would attend college.[11] When Steve Jobs was in high school, his mother Clara admitted to his girlfriend, 17-year-old Chrisann Brennan, that she “was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first six months of his life … I was scared they were going to take him away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I wanted to return him.”[17] When Chrisann shared his mother’s comment with Steve, he stated that he was already aware of that[17] and would later say he was deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara.[18] Many years later, Steve Jobs’s wife Laurene also noted that “he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents.”[18] Jobs would become upset when Paul and Clara were referred to as “adoptive parents” as they “were my parents 1,000%.”[11] With regard to his biological parents, Jobs referred to them as “my sperm and egg bank. That’s not harsh, it’s just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more.”[11] Jandali has also stated that “I really am not his dad. Mr. and Mrs. Jobs are, as they raised him. And I don’t want to take their place.”[16]</p>\n <p>Childhood</p>\n <p>“I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics ... then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that’s what I wanted to do.”<br>\n —Steve Jobs[11]<br>\n Paul and Clara adopted Jobs’s sister Patricia in 1957[11] and the family moved to Mountain View, California in 1961.[14] It was during this time that Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to “pass along his love of mechanics.”[11] Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father’s craftsmanship “because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him … I wasn’t that into fixing cars … but I was eager to hang out with my dad.”[11] By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood.[14] He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a “loner.”[14]</p>\n <p>Home of Paul and Clara Jobs, on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.<br>\n Childhood home of Steve Jobs in Los Altos, California that served as the original site of Apple Computer. The home was added to a list of historic Los Altos sites in 2013.[19]<br>\n Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved and was suspended a few times.[14] Clara had taught him to read as a toddler, and Jobs stated that he was “pretty bored in school and [had] turned into a little terror… you should have seen us in the third grade, we basically destroyed the teacher.”[14] He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary school in Mountain View.[11] His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not placing enough challenge on his brilliant son.[11]</p>\n <p>Jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene ‘Teddy’ Hill, with turning him around: “She taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation. She bribed me into learning. She would say, ‘I really want you to finish this workbook. I’ll give you five bucks if you finish it.’ That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn’t let it happen.”[14] Jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View[14] where he became a “socially awkward loner.”[11] Jobs “was often bullied” and gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.</p>\n <p>Though the Jobs family was not well off, they used all their savings in 1967 to buy a new home, which would allow Jobs to change schools.[14] The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California) was in the better Cupertino School District, Cupertino, California, [11] and was embedded in an environment that was even more heavily populated with engineering families than the Mountain View home.[14] The house was declared a historic site in 2013 as it was the first site for Apple Computer[19] and is now owned by Patty and occupied by Jobs’s step-mother Marilyn.[20]</p>\n <p>When he was 13 in 1968, Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project: “He didn’t know me at all, but he ended up giving me some parts and he got me a job that summer working at Hewlett-Packard on the line, assembling frequency counters…well, assembling may be too strong. I was putting in screws. It didn’t matter; I was in heaven.”[14]</p>\n <p>Bill Fernandez, a fellow electronics hobbyist who was in Jobs’s grade at Cupertino Junior High, was his first friend after the 1967 move. Fernandez later commented that “for some reason the kids in the eighth grade didn’t like [Jobs] because they thought he was odd. I was one of his few friends.” Fernandez eventually introduced Jobs to 18-year-old electronics whiz and Homestead High alumn Steve Wozniak, who lived across the street from Fernandez.</p>\n <p>Homestead High</p>\n <p>The location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to attend Homestead High School in (and with strong ties to) Silicon Valley.[11] He began his first year there in late 1968 along with Fernandez.[14] Neither Jobs nor Fernandez (whose father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in John McCollum’s “Electronics 1.”[14] McCollum and the rebellious Jobs (who had grown his hair long and become involved in the growing counterculture) would eventually clash and Jobs began to lose interest in the class. He also had no interest in sports and would later say that he didn’t have what it took to “be a jock. I was always a loner.”[14]</p>\n <p>He underwent a change during mid-1970: “I got stoned for the first time; I discovered Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas, and all that classic stuff. I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative writing classes.”[14] Jobs also later noted to his official biographer that “I started to listen to music a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology—Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear … when I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP English class. The teacher was this guy who looked like Ernest Hemingway. He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite.” From that point, Jobs developed two different circles of friends: those who were involved in electronics and engineering and those who were interested in art and literature.[11] These dual interests were particularly reflected during Jobs’s senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan.[17]</p>\n <p>In 1971 after Wozniak began attending University of California, Berkeley, Jobs would visit him there a few times a week. This experience led him to study in nearby Stanford University’s student union. Jobs also decided that rather than join the electronics club, he would put on light shows with a friend for Homestead’s avant-garde Jazz program. He was described by a Homestead classmate as “kind of a brain and kind of a hippie … but he never fit into either group. He was smart enough to be a nerd, but wasn’t nerdy. And he was too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. He was kind of an outsider. In high school everything revolved around what group you were in. and if you weren’t in a carefully defined group, you weren’t anybody. He was an individual, in a world where individuality was suspect.” By his senior year in late 1971, he was taking freshman English class at Stanford and working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann.[14] In mid-1972, after graduation and before leaving for Reed College, Jobs and Brennan rented a house from their other roommate, Al.[17][21] During the summer, Brennan, Jobs, and Steve Wozniak found an advertisement posted on the De Anza College bulletin board for a job that required people to dress up as characters from Alice in Wonderland. Brennan portrayed Alice while Wozniak, Jobs, and Al portrayed the White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter.[17]</p>\n <p>Reed College</p>\n <p>“I was interested in Eastern mysticism which hit the shores about then. At Reed there was a constant flow of people stopping by – from Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert, to Gary Snyder. There was a constant flow of intellectual questioning about the truth of life. That was the time when every college student in the country read Be Here Now and Diet for a Small Planet.”<br>\n —Steve Jobs[14]<br>\n Later in the year, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Reed was an expensive college which Paul and Clara could ill afford. They were spending much of their life savings on their son’s higher education.[11] Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he was at Reed College. She also met his Reed friend Daniel Kottke for the first time.[17] Jobs also became friends with Reed’s student body president Robert Friedland.[14]</p>\n <p>Brennan (who was now a senior at Homestead) did not have plans to attend college, and was supportive of Jobs when he told her he planned to drop out of Reed because he did not want to spend his parents’ money on it (neither her father nor Jobs’s adoptive parents had gone to college). He continued to attend by auditing classes, including a course on calligraphy taught by Robert Palladino, but since he was no longer an official student, Brennan stopped visiting him. Jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she refused. He had started seeing other women, and she was interested in someone she met in her art class. Brennan speculates that the house was Jobs’s attempt to make their relationship monogamous again.[17] In a 2005 commencement speech for Stanford University, Jobs states that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends’ dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In that same speech, Jobs said: “If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.”[22]</p>\n <p>1972–1985</p>\n <p>I was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and idealistic industry. There weren’t many degrees offered in computer science, so people in computers were brilliant people from mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever. They loved it, and no one was really in it for the money […] There are people around here who start companies just to make money, but the great companies, well, that’s not what they’re about.”<br>\n —Steve Jobs[23]<br>\n Pre-Apple<br>\n In mid-1972, Jobs moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area and was renting his own apartment. Brennan states by this point that their “relationship was complicated. I couldn’t break the connection and I couldn’t commit. Steve couldn’t either.” Jobs hitchhiked and worked around the West Coast and Brennan would occasionally join him. At the same time, Brennan notes, “little by little, Steve and I separated. But we were never able to fully let go. We never talked about breaking up or going our separate ways and we didn’t have that conversation where one person says it’s over.” They continued to grow apart, but Jobs would still seek her out, and visit her while she was working in a health food store or as a live-in babysitter. They remained involved with each other while continuing to see other people.[17]</p>\n <p>In 1973, Steve Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game Pong. After finishing it, Wozniak gave the board to Jobs, who then took the game down to Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California. Atari thought that Jobs had built it and gave him a job as a technician.[24][25] Atari’s cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described him as “difficult but valuable”, pointing out that “he was very often the smartest guy in the room, and he would let people know that.”[26]</p>\n <p>By early 1973, Jobs was living what Brennan describes as a “simple life” in a Los Gatos cabin, working at Atari, and saving money for his impending trip to India. Brennan visited him twice at the cabin. She states in her memoir that her memories of this cabin consist of Jobs reading Be Here Now (and giving her a copy), listening to South Indian music, and using a Japanese meditation pillow. Brennan felt that he was more distant and negative toward her. Brennan states in her memoir that she met with Jobs right before he left for India and that he tried to give her a $100 bill that he had earned at Atari. She initially refused to accept it but eventually accepted the money.[27]</p>\n <p>Jobs traveled to India in mid-1974[28] to visit Neem Karoli Baba[29] at his Kainchi ashram with his Reed friend (and eventual Apple employee) Daniel Kottke, in search of spiritual enlightenment. When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram, it was almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973.[25] Then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Haidakhan Babaji. In India, they spent a lot of time on bus rides from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.[25]</p>\n <p>After staying for seven months, Jobs left India[30] and returned to the US ahead of Daniel Kottke.[25] Jobs had changed his appearance; his head was shaved and he wore traditional Indian clothing.[31][32] During this time, Jobs experimented with psychedelics, later calling his LSD experiences “one of the two or three most important things [he had] done in [his] life.”[33][34] He spent a period at the All One Farm, a commune in Oregon and Brennan joined him there for a period.[17]</p>\n <p>During this time period, Jobs and Brennan both became practitioners of Zen Buddhism through the Zen master Kōbun Chino Otogawa. Jobs was living with his parents again, in their backyard toolshed which he had converted into a bedroom with a sleeping bag, mat, books, a candle, and a meditation pillow.[17] Jobs engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the oldest Sōtō Zen monastery in the US.[35] He considered taking up monastic residence at Eihei-ji in Japan, and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen.[36] Jobs would later say that people around him who did not share his countercultural roots could not fully relate to his thinking.[33]</p>\n <p>Jobs then returned to Atari and was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout. According to Bushnell, Atari offered US$100 for each TTL chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little specialized knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Much to the amazement of Atari engineers, Wozniak reduced the TTL count to 46, a design so tight that it was impossible to reproduce on an assembly line.[37] According to Wozniak, Jobs told him that Atari gave them only $700 (instead of the $5,000 paid out), and that Wozniak’s share was thus $350.[38] Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later, but said that if Jobs had told him about it and explained that he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.[39]</p>\n <p>Wozniak had designed a low-cost digital “blue box” to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls. Jobs decided that they could make money selling it. The clandestine sales of the illegal “blue boxes” went well and perhaps planted the seed in Jobs’s mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable.[40] Jobs, in a 1994 interview, recalled that it took six months for him and Wozniak to figure out how to build the blue boxes.[41] Jobs said that if not for the blue boxes, there would have been no Apple. He states it showed them that they could take on large companies and beat them.[42][43]</p>\n <p>Apple (1976–1985)<br>\n See also: History of Apple<br>\n “Basically Steve Wozniak and I invented the Apple because we wanted a personal computer. Not only couldn’t we afford the computers that were on the market, those computers were impractical for us to use. We needed a Volkswagen. The Volkswagen isn’t as fast or comfortable as other ways of traveling, but the VW owners can go where they want, when they want and with whom they want. The VW owners have personal control of their car.”<br>\n —Steve Jobs.[14]<br>\n Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975.[44] In 1976, Wozniak invented the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it. Jobs, Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne formed Apple Computer in the garage of Jobs’s Los Altos home on Crist Drive.[45] Wayne stayed only a short time, leaving Jobs and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company.[46] A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Jobs as an odd individual who would greet his clients “with his underwear hanging out, barefoot and hippie-like.”[20] Another neighbor, Larry Waterland, who had just earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford, recalled dismissing Jobs’s budding business: ” ‘You punched cards, put them in a big deck,’ he said about the mainframe machines of that time. ‘Steve took me over to the garage. He had a circuit board with a chip on it, a DuMont TV set, a Panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard. He said, ‘This is an Apple computer.’ I said, ‘You’ve got to be joking.’ I dismissed the whole idea.’ “[20] Jobs’s friend from Reed College and India, Daniel Kottke, recalled that he “was the only person who worked in the garage … Woz would show up once a week with his latest code. Steve Jobs didn’t get his hands dirty in that sense.” Kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in Jobs’s kitchen, where he spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the company.[20]</p>\n <p>They received funding from a then-semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer Mike Markkula.[47] Scott McNealy, one of the cofounders of Sun Microsystems, said that Jobs broke a “glass age ceiling” in Silicon Valley because he’d created a very successful company at a young age.[43]</p>\n <p>“For what characterizes Apple is that its scientific staff always acted and performed like artists – in a field filled with dry personalities limited by the rational and binary worlds they inhabit, Apple’s engineering teams had passion. They always believed that what they were doing was important and, most of all, fun. Working at Apple was never just a job; it was also a crusade, a mission, to bring better computer power to people. At its roots that attitude came from Steve Jobs. It was “Power to the People”, the slogan of the sixties, rewritten in technology for the eighties and called Macintosh.”<br>\n —Jeffrey S. Young, Steve Jobs: The Journey is the Reward (1987).[14]<br>\n After she returned from her own journey to India, Brennan visited Jobs at his parents’ home, where he was still living. It was during this period that Jobs and Brennan fell in love again, as Brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to Kobun (whom she was also still following). It was also at this time that Jobs displayed a prototype Apple computer for Brennan and his parents in their living room. Brennan notes a shift in this time period, where the two main influences on Jobs were Apple and Kobun. By the early 1977, she and Jobs would spend time together at her home at Duveneck Ranch in Los Altos, which served as a hostel and environmental education center. Brennan also worked there as a teacher for inner city children who came to learn about the farm.[17]</p>\n <p>In 1977, Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire. It was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer and was one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products,[48] It was designed primarily by Steve Wozniak. Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II’s unusual case[11] and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply.[49]</p>\n <p>Jobs usually went to work wearing a black long-sleeved mock turtleneck made by Issey Miyake (it was sometimes reported as St. Croix brand), Levi’s 501 blue jeans, and New Balance 991 sneakers.[50][51] He said his choice was inspired by that of Stuart Geman, a noted applied mathematics professor at Brown University. Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson “…he came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself, both because of its daily convenience (the rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature style.”[50]</p>\n <p>Jobs and Apple became more successful, and his relationship with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now a part of their relationship, and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino.[17] Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple .[17][52] Brennan’s relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take “a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples.”[17] Both Holt and Jobs felt that it would be a good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan’s decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan “turned ugly” at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: “I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn’t want to do that.”[17] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her.[11] Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could “be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don’t get what the problem is.”[17] Brennan however notes that she “felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous. I could not have endured it.”[17]</p>\n <p>Brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple. She stated that Jobs told her “If you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry” and “I am never going to help you.”[17] Now alone, Brennan was on welfare and cleaning houses to earn money. She would sometimes ask Jobs for money but he always refused. Brennan hid her pregnancy for as long as she could, living in a variety of homes and continuing her work with Zen meditation. At the same time, according to Brennan, Jobs “started to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child.” A few weeks before she was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm in Oregon and she accepted the offer.[17] When Jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him)[11] Brennan gave birth to her baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978.[17][53]</p>\n <p>“Dear Mike, This morning’s papers carried suggestions that Apple is considering removing me as chairman. I don’t know the source of these reports, but they are both misleading to the public and unfair to me. You will recall that at last Thursday’s Board meeting I stated I had decided to start a new venture, and I tendered my resignation as chairman. The Board declined to accept my resignation and asked me to defer it for a week. I agreed to do so in light of the encouragement the Board offered with regard to the proposed new venture and the indications that Apple would invest in it. On Friday, after I told John Sculley who would be joining me, he confirmed Apple’s willingness to discuss areas of possible collaboration between Apple and my new venture. Subsequently the Company appears to be adopting a hostile posture toward me and the new venture. Accordingly, I must insist upon the immediate acceptance of my resignation. I would hope that in any statement it feels it must issue, the Company will make it clear that the decision to resign as chairman was mine. I find myself both saddened and perplexed by the management’s conduct in this matter which seems to me contrary to Apple’s best interests. Those interests remain a matter of deep concern to me, both because of my past association with Apple and the substantial investment I retain in it. I continue to hope that calmer voices within the Company may yet be heard. Some Company representatives have said they fear I will use proprietary Apple technology in my new venture. There is no basis for any such concern. If that concern is the real source of Apple’s hostility to the venture, I can allay it. As you know, the company’s recent re-organization left me with no work to do and no access even to regular management reports. I am but 30 and want still to contribute and achieve. After what we have accomplished together, I would wish our parting to be both amicable and dignified. Yours sincerely, Steven P. Jobs.”<br>\n —Steve Jobs, letter of resignation from Apple Computer, September 17th, 1985.[14]<br>\n Jobs went there for the birth after he was contacted by Robert Friedland, their mutual friend and owner of the All One Farm. While distant, Jobs worked with her on a name for the baby, which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket. Brennan suggested the name “Lisa” which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name “Lisa” while he “was also publicly denying paternity.” She would discover later that during this time, Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name (his first choice was “Claire” after St. Clare). She also stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby’s name for a computer and he hid the plans from her. Jobs also worked with his team to come up with the phrase, “Local Integrated Software Architecture” as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa[54] (decades later, however, Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that “obviously, it was named for my daughter”[55]). Brennan would come under intense criticism from Jobs, who claimed that “she doesn’t want money, she just wants me.” According to Brennan, Apple’s Mike Scott wanted Jobs to give her money, while other Apple executives “advised him to ignore me or fight if I tried to go after a paternity settlement.”[17]</p>\n <p>When Jobs denied paternity, a DNA test established him as Lisa’s father. It required him to give Brennan $385 a month in addition to returning the welfare money she had received. Jobs gave her $500 a month at the time when Apple went public, and Jobs became a millionaire. Brennan worked as a waitress in Palo Alto. Later, Brennan agreed to give an interview with Michael Moritz for Time magazine for its Time Person of the Year special, released on January 3, 1983, in which she discussed her relationship with Jobs. Rather than name Jobs the Person of the Year, the magazine named the computer the “Machine of the Year”.[56] In the issue, Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test (which stated that the “probability of paternity for Jobs, Steven… is 94.1%”).[57] Jobs responded by arguing that “28% of the male population of the United States could be the father.”[17][57] Time also noted that “the baby girl and the machine on which Apple has placed so much hope for the future share the same name: Lisa.”[57]</p>\n <p>Jobs was worth a million dollars when he was 23 in 1978, 10 million when he was 24, and over 100 million when he was 25. He was also one of the youngest “people ever to make the Forbes list of the nation’s richest people – and one of only a handful to have done it themselves, without inherited wealth.”[14]</p>\n <p>In 1978, Apple recruited Mike Scott from National Semiconductor to serve as CEO for what turned out to be several turbulent years. In 1983, Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as Apple’s CEO, asking, “Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?”[58]</p>\n <p>In 1982, Jobs bought an apartment in the two top floors of The San Remo, a Manhattan building with a politically progressive reputation. Although he never lived there,[59] he spent years renovating it with the help of I. M. Pei. In 2003, he sold it to U2 singer Bono.</p>\n <p>In 1984, Jobs bought the Jackling House and estate, and resided there for a decade. After that, he leased it out for several years until 2000 when he stopped maintaining the house, allowing exposure to the weather to degrade it. In 2004, Jobs received permission from the town of Woodside to demolish the house in order to build a smaller contemporary styled one. After a few years in court, the house was finally demolished in 2011, a few months before he died.[60]</p>\n <p>In early 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh, which was based on The Lisa (and Xerox PARC’s mouse-driven graphical user interface).[61][62] The following year, Apple aired a Super Bowl television commercial titled “1984.” At Apple’s annual shareholders meeting on January 24, 1984, an emotional Jobs introduced the Macintosh to a wildly enthusiastic audience; Andy Hertzfeld described the scene as “pandemonium.”[63]</p>\n <p>Despite the fanfare, the expensive Macintosh was a hard sell.[64] Shortly after its release in 1985, Bill Gates’s then-developing company, Microsoft, threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless it was granted “a license for the Mac operating system software. Microsoft was developing its graphical user interface … for DOS, which it was calling Windows and didn’t want Apple to sue over the similarities between the Windows GUI and the Mac interface.”[65] Sculley granted Microsoft the license which later led to problems for Apple.[65] In addition, cheap IBM PC clones that ran on Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear. Although the Macintosh preceded the clones, it was far more expensive, so “through the late ’80s, the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple.”[66] Windows based IBM-PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM’s TopView or Digital Research’s GEM,[66] and thus “the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac…it seemed clear as the ’80s wound down that Apple couldn’t go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market.”[66]</p>\n <p>External video<br>\n Machine That Changed The World, The; Paperback Computer, The; Interview with Steve Jobs, 1990, 50:08, 05/14/1990, WGBH Media Library &amp; Archives[67]<br>\n Sculley’s and Jobs’s respective visions for the company greatly differed. The former favored open architecture computers like the Apple II, sold to education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company to focus on the closed architecture Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the board Jobs’s Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services.[68] Although its products provided 85% of Apple’s sales in early 1985, the company’s January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees. Many left including Wozniak, who stated that the company had “been going in the wrong direction for the last five years” and sold most of his stock.[69] The Macintosh’s failure to defeat the PC strengthened Sculley’s position in the company.</p>\n <p>In May 1985, Sculley—encouraged by Arthur Rock—decided to reorganize Apple, and proposed a plan to the board that would remove Jobs from the Macintosh group and put him in charge of “New Product Development.” This move would effectively render Jobs powerless within Apple.[14] In response, Jobs then developed a plan to get rid of Sculley and take over Apple. However, Jobs was confronted after the plan was leaked, and he said that he would leave Apple. The Board declined his resignation and asked him to reconsider. Sculley also told Jobs that he had all of the votes needed to go ahead with the reorganization. A few months later, on September 17, 1985, Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to the Apple Board. Five additional senior Apple employees also resigned and joined Jobs in his new venture, NeXT.[14]</p>\n <p>1985–1997</p>\n <p>NeXT computer<br>\n See also: NeXT<br>\n Following his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT Inc.[70] with $7 million. A year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon. Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in the company.[71] The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs’s comeback event,[72] a lavish invitation only gala launch event[73] that was described as a multimedia extravaganza.[74] The celebration was held at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, California on Wednesday October 12, 1988.</p>\n <p>NeXT workstations were first released in 1990 and priced at US$9,999. Like the Apple Lisa, the NeXT workstation was technologically advanced and designed for the education sector, but was largely dismissed as cost-prohibitive for educational institutions.[75] The NeXT workstation was known for its technical strengths, chief among them its object-oriented software development system. Jobs marketed NeXT products to the financial, scientific, and academic community, highlighting its innovative, experimental new technologies, such as the Mach kernel, the digital signal processor chip, and the built-in Ethernet port. Making use of a NeXT computer, English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN in Switzerland.[76]</p>\n <p>The revised, second generation NeXTcube was released in 1990. Jobs touted it as the first “interpersonal” computer that would replace the personal computer. With its innovative NeXTMail multimedia email system, NeXTcube could share voice, image, graphics, and video in email for the first time. “Interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and groupwork”, Jobs told reporters.[77] Jobs ran NeXT with an obsession for aesthetic perfection, as evidenced by the development of and attention to NeXTcube’s magnesium case.[78] This put considerable strain on NeXT’s hardware division, and in 1993, after having sold only 50,000 machines, NeXT transitioned fully to software development with the release of NeXTSTEP/Intel.[79] The company reported its first profit of $1.03 million in 1994.[71] In 1996, NeXT Software, Inc. released WebObjects, a framework for Web application development. After NeXT was acquired by Apple Inc. in 1997, WebObjects was used to build and run the Apple Store,[79] MobileMe services, and the iTunes Store.</p>\n <p>Pixar and Disney<br>\n In 1986, Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm’s computer graphics division for the price of $10 million, $5 million of which was given to the company as capital and $5 million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights.[9]</p>\n <p>The first film produced by Pixar with its Disney partnership, Toy Story (1995), with Jobs credited as executive producer,[80] brought fame and critical acclaim to the studio when it was released. Over the next 15 years, under Pixar’s creative chief John Lasseter, the company produced box-office hits A Bug’s Life (1998); Toy Story 2 (1999); Monsters, Inc. (2001); Finding Nemo (2003); The Incredibles (2004); Cars (2006); Ratatouille (2007); WALL-E (2008); Up (2009); and Toy Story 3 (2010). Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up and Toy Story 3 each received the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, an award introduced in 2001.[81]</p>\n <p>In 2003 and 2004, as Pixar’s contract with Disney was running out, Jobs and Disney chief executive Michael Eisner tried but failed to negotiate a new partnership,[82] and in early 2004, Jobs announced that Pixar would seek a new partner to distribute its films after its contract with Disney expired.</p>\n <p>In October 2005, Bob Iger replaced Eisner at Disney, and Iger quickly worked to mend relations with Jobs and Pixar. On January 24, 2006, Jobs and Iger announced that Disney had agreed to purchase Pixar in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4 billion. When the deal closed, Jobs became The Walt Disney Company’s largest single shareholder with approximately seven percent of the company’s stock.[83] Jobs’s holdings in Disney far exceeded those of Eisner, who holds 1.7 percent, and of Disney family member Roy E. Disney, who until his 2009 death held about one percent of the company’s stock and whose criticisms of Eisner – especially that he soured Disney’s relationship with Pixar – accelerated Eisner’s ousting. Upon completion of the merger, Jobs received 7% of Disney shares, and joined the board of directors as the largest individual shareholder.[83][84][85] Upon Jobs’s death his shares in Disney were transferred to the Steven P. Jobs Trust led by Laurene Jobs.[86]</p>\n <p>Floyd Norman, of Pixar, described Jobs as a “mature, mellow individual” who never interfered with the creative process of the filmmakers.[87] In early June 2014, Pixar cofounder and Walt Disney Animation Studios President Ed Catmull revealed that Jobs once advised him to “just explain it to them until they understand” in disagreements. Catmull released the book Creativity Inc. in 2014, in which he recounts numerous experiences of working with Jobs. Regarding his own manner of dealing with Jobs, Catmull writes:</p>\n <p>In all the 26 years with Steve, Steve and I never had one of these loud verbal arguments and it’s not my nature to do that. … but we did disagree fairly frequently about things. … I would say something to him and he would immediately shoot it down because he could think faster than I could. … I would then wait a week … I’d call him up and I give my counter argument to what he had said and he’d immediately shoot it down. So I had to wait another week, and sometimes this went on for months. But in the end one of three things happened. About a third of the time he said, ‘Oh, I get it, you’re right.’ And that was the end of it. And it was another third of the time in which [I’d] say, ‘Actually I think he is right.’ The other third of the time, where we didn’t reach consensus, he just let me do it my way, never said anything more about it.[88]</p>\n <p>Family</p>\n <p>Steve Jobs’s house in Palo Alto</p>\n <p>Steve Jobs’s house, as viewed from an adjacent sidewalk. Abundant fruit trees are visible next to the house.<br>\n Chrisann Brennan notes that after Jobs was forced out of Apple, “he apologized many times over for his behavior” towards her and Lisa. She also states that Jobs “said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry.”[17] By this time, Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa and when she was nine, Jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from “Lisa Brennan” to “Lisa Brennan-Jobs.”[17] In addition, Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to co-parent Lisa, a change Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister, Mona Simpson (who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs).[17] Jobs found Mona after first finding his birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after he left Apple.[11]</p>\n <p>Jobs did not contact his birth family during Clara’s (his adoptive mother) lifetime, however. He would later tell his official biographer Walter Isaacson: “I never wanted [Paul and Clara] to feel like I didn’t consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents […] I loved them so much that I never wanted them to know of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out.”[11] However, in 1986 when he was 31, Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began to spend a great deal of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption, information that motivated him to find his biological mother. Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant. Although the doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive, he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death. As he died soon afterwards, Jobs was given the letter which stated that “his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble.”[11]</p>\n <p>Jobs only contacted Schieble after Clara died and after he received permission from his father, Paul. In addition, out of respect for Paul, he asked the media not to report on his search.[11] Jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need “to see if she was okay and to thank her, because I’m glad I didn’t end up as an abortion. She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me.”[11] Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though she wasn’t familiar with the history of Apple or Jobs’s role in it) and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers. She said that she regretted giving him up and repeatedly apologized to him for it. Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and would spend Christmas together.[11] When Jobs died in 2011, Schieble was suffering from dementia and living in a nursing home. She was not told about his death.[89]</p>\n <p>During this first visit, Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother.[11] Schieble then arranged for them to meet in New York where Mona worked. Her first impression of Jobs was that “he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy.”[11] Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other.[11] Jobs later told his biographer that “Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me . . . . As we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family. I don’t know what I’d do without her. I can’t imagine a better sister. My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close.”[11]</p>\n <p>“I grew up as an only child, with a single mother. Because we were poor and because I knew my father had emigrated from Syria, I imagined he looked like Omar Sharif. I hoped he would be rich and kind and would come into our lives (and our not-yet-furnished apartment) and help us. Later, after I’d met my father, I tried to believe he’d changed his number and left no forwarding address because he was an idealistic revolutionary, plotting a new world for the Arab people. Even as a feminist, my whole life I’d been waiting for a man to love, who could love me. For decades, I’d thought that man would be my father. When I was 25, I met that man, and he was my brother.”<br>\n —Mona Simpson[90]<br>\n Jobs then learned his family history. Six months after he was given up for adoption, Schieble’s father died, she wed Jandali, and they had a daughter, Mona.[11][10] Jandali states that after finishing his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him[10] (they divorced in 1962).[11] He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time:</p>\n <p>I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn’t know where she was, but since 10 years ago we’ve been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida.[10]</p>\n <p>A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather’s last name thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.[11]</p>\n <p>Jobs told his official biographer that after meeting Simpson, he wanted to become involved in her ongoing search for their father. When he was found working in Sacramento, they decided that only Simpson would meet him. Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching for the restaurant business. He also said that he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that “we’ll never see that baby again. That baby’s gone.” (Simpson did not mention that she had met Jobs).[11] Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that “all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs … oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy and a big tipper.”[11] After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that “it was amazing …. I had been to that restaurant a few times, and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands.”[11] However, Jobs did not want to meet Jandali because “I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn’t trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it … I asked Mona not to tell him about me.”[11] Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked “what is this thing about Steve Jobs?” Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, “My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive … He never contacted Steve.”[11] Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did.[11] Jobs also never showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East.[11] Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, The Lost Father.[11]</p>\n <p>In 1989, Jobs first met his future wife, Laurene Powell, when he gave a lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where she was a student. Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene “was right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn’t take my eyes off of her … kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy.”[18] After the lecture, Jobs met up with her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner. From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the rest of his life.[18] Powell’s father died when she was very young, and her mother raised her in a middle class New Jersey home similar to the one Jobs grew up in. After she received her B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, she spent a short period in high finance but found it didn’t interest her, so she decided to pursue her MBA at Stanford instead. In addition, unlike Jobs, she was athletic and followed professional sports. She also brought as much self-sufficiency to the relationship as he did and was more of a private than public person.[18] Jobs proposed on New Year’s Day 1990 with “a fistful of freshly picked wildflowers.”[18] They married on March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park.[18] Fifty people, including his father, Paul, and his sister, Mona, attended. The ceremony was conducted by Jobs’s guru, Kobun Chino Otogawa. The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of Yosemite’s Half Dome, and the wedding ended with a hike (during which Laurene’s brothers had a snowball fight). Jobs is reported to have said to Mona: “You see, Mona […], Laurene is descended from Joe Namath, and we’re descended from John Muir.”[11]</p>\n <p>Jobs and Powell’s first child, Reed, was born September 1991.[71] Jobs’s father, Paul, died a year and a half later, on March 5, 1993. Jobs and Powell had two more children, Erin, born in August 1995, and Eve, born in 1998.[71] The family lived in Palo Alto, California.[91] A journalist who grew up locally remembered him as owning the house with “the scariest [Hallow’een] decorations in Palo Alto…I don’t remember seeing him. I was busy being terrified.”[92]</p>\n <p>1997–2011</p>\n <p>Return to Apple<br>\n See also: Apple Inc. § 1997–2007: Return to profitability<br>\n Full-length portrait of man about fifty wearing jeans and a black turtleneck shirt, standing in front of a dark curtain with a white Apple logo<br>\n Jobs on stage at Macworld Conference &amp; Expo, San Francisco, January 11, 2005<br>\n In 1996, Apple announced that it would buy NeXT for $427 million. The deal was finalized in February 1997,[93] bringing Jobs back to the company he had cofounded. Jobs became de facto chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July 1997. He was formally named interim chief executive in September.[94] In March 1998, to concentrate Apple’s efforts on returning to profitability, Jobs terminated a number of projects, such as Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc. In the coming months, many employees developed a fear of encountering Jobs while riding in the elevator, “afraid that they might not have a job when the doors opened. The reality was that Jobs’s summary executions were rare, but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company.”[95] Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.</p>\n <p>With the purchase of NeXT, much of the company’s technology found its way into Apple products, most notably NeXTSTEP, which evolved into Mac OS X. Under Jobs’s guidance, the company increased sales significantly with the introduction of the iMac and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for Apple. At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Jobs officially dropped the “interim” modifier from his title at Apple and became permanent CEO.[96] Jobs quipped at the time that he would be using the title “iCEO”.[97]</p>\n <p>The company subsequently branched out, introducing and improving upon other digital appliances. With the introduction of the iPod portable music player, iTunes digital music software, and the iTunes Store, the company made forays into consumer electronics and music distribution. On June 29, 2007, Apple entered the cellular phone business with the introduction of the iPhone, a multi-touch display cell phone, which also included the features of an iPod and, with its own mobile browser, revolutionized the mobile browsing scene. While nurturing innovation, Jobs also reminded his employees that “real artists ship [deliver product].”[98]</p>\n <p>Jobs had a public war of words with Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell, starting in 1987, when Jobs first criticized Dell for making “un-innovative beige boxes”.[99] On October 6, 1997, at a Gartner Symposium, when Dell was asked what he would do if he ran the then-troubled Apple Computer company, he said: “I’d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.”[100] Then, in 2006, Jobs sent an email to all employees when Apple’s market capitalization rose above Dell’s:</p>\n <p>Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn’t perfect at predicting the future. Based on today’s stock market close, Apple is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today. Steve.[101]</p>\n <p>Jobs was both admired and criticized for his consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship, which has been dubbed the “reality distortion field” and was particularly evident during his keynote speeches (colloquially known as “Stevenotes”) at Macworld Expos and at Apple Worldwide Developers Conferences.[102]</p>\n <p>Jobs was a board member at Gap Inc. from 1999 to 2002.[103]</p>\n <p>Two men in their fifties shown full length sitting in red leather chairs smiling at each other<br>\n Steve Jobs and Bill Gates at the fifth D: All Things Digital conference (D5) in May 2007<br>\n In 2001, Jobs was granted stock options in the amount of 7.5 million shares of Apple with an exercise price of $18.30. It was alleged that the options had been backdated, and that the exercise price should have been $21.10. It was further alleged that Jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of $20,000,000 that he did not report, and that Apple overstated its earnings by that same amount. As a result, Jobs potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil penalties. The case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations,[104] though an independent internal Apple investigation completed on December 29, 2006 found that Jobs was unaware of these issues and that the options granted to him were returned without being exercised in 2003.[105]</p>\n <p>In 2005, Jobs responded to criticism of Apple’s poor recycling programs for e-waste in the US by lashing out at environmental and other advocates at Apple’s annual meeting in Cupertino in April. A few weeks later, Apple announced it would take back iPods for free at its retail stores. The Computer TakeBack Campaign responded by flying a banner from a plane over the Stanford University graduation at which Jobs was the commencement speaker. The banner read “Steve, don’t be a mini-player—recycle all e-waste.”</p>\n <p>In 2006, he further expanded Apple’s recycling programs to any US customer who buys a new Mac. This program includes shipping and “environmentally friendly disposal” of their old systems.[106] The success of Apple’s unique products and services provided several years of stable financial returns, propelling Apple to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company in 2011.[107]</p>\n <p>Jobs was perceived as a demanding perfectionist[108][109] who always aspired to position his businesses and their products at the forefront of the information technology industry by foreseeing and setting innovation and style trends. He summed up this self-concept at the end of his keynote speech at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January 2007, by quoting ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky:</p>\n <p>There’s an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love. “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.” And we’ve always tried to do that at Apple. Since the very, very beginning. And we always will.[110]</p>\n <p>On July 1, 2008, a US$7 billion class action suit was filed against several members of the Apple board of directors for revenue lost because of alleged securities fraud.[111][112]</p>\n <p>In a 2011 interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs revealed that he had met with U.S. President Barack Obama, complained about the nation’s shortage of software engineers, and told Obama that he was “headed for a one-term presidency”.[113] Jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a U.S. university should automatically be offered a green card. After the meeting, Jobs commented, “The president is very smart, but he kept explaining to us reasons why things can’t get done . . . . It infuriates me.”[113]</p>\n <p>Health issues<br>\n In October 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with cancer.[114] In mid-2004, he announced to his employees that he had a cancerous tumor in his pancreas.[115] The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is usually very poor;[116] Jobs stated that he had a rare, much less aggressive type, known as islet cell neuroendocrine tumor.[115]</p>\n <p>Despite his diagnosis, Jobs resisted his doctors’ recommendations for medical intervention for nine months,[117] instead relying on a pseudo-medicine diet to try natural healing to thwart the disease. According to Harvard researcher Ramzi Amri, his choice of alternative treatment “led to an unnecessarily early death”.[114] Other doctors agree that Jobs’s diet was insufficient to address his disease. Cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski, for instance, said, “My best guess was that Jobs probably only modestly decreased his chances of survival, if that.”[118] Barrie R. Cassileth, the chief of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s integrative medicine department,[119] said, “Jobs’s faith in alternative medicine likely cost him his life…. He had the only kind of pancreatic cancer that is treatable and curable…. He essentially committed suicide.”[120] According to Jobs’s biographer, Walter Isaacson, “for nine months he refused to undergo surgery for his pancreatic cancer – a decision he later regretted as his health declined”.[121] “Instead, he tried a vegan diet, acupuncture, herbal remedies, and other treatments he found online, and even consulted a psychic. He was also influenced by a doctor who ran a clinic that advised juice fasts, bowel cleansings and other unproven approaches, before finally having surgery in July 2004.”[122] He eventually underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (or “Whipple procedure”) in July 2004, that appeared to remove the tumor successfully.[123][124] Jobs did not receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy.[115][125] During Jobs’s absence, Tim Cook, head of worldwide sales and operations at Apple, ran the company.[115]</p>\n <p>In early August 2006, Jobs delivered the keynote for Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference. His “thin, almost gaunt” appearance and unusually “listless” delivery,[126][127] together with his choice to delegate significant portions of his keynote to other presenters, inspired a flurry of media and Internet speculation about the state of his health.[128] In contrast, according to an Ars Technica journal report, Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) attendees who saw Jobs in person said he “looked fine”.[129] Following the keynote, an Apple spokesperson said that “Steve’s health is robust.”[130]</p>\n <p>Two years later, similar concerns followed Jobs’s 2008 WWDC keynote address.[131] Apple officials stated that Jobs was victim to a “common bug” and was taking antibiotics,[132] while others surmised his cachectic appearance was due to the Whipple procedure.[125] During a July conference call discussing Apple earnings, participants responded to repeated questions about Jobs’s health by insisting that it was a “private matter”. Others said that shareholders had a right to know more, given Jobs’s hands-on approach to running his company.[133][134] Based on an off-the-record phone conversation with Jobs, The New York Times reported, “While his health problems amounted to a good deal more than ‘a common bug’, they weren’t life-threatening and he doesn’t have a recurrence of cancer.”[135]</p>\n <p>On August 28, 2008, Bloomberg mistakenly published a 2500-word obituary of Jobs in its corporate news service, containing blank spaces for his age and cause of death. (News carriers customarily stockpile up-to-date obituaries to facilitate news delivery in the event of a well-known figure’s death.) Although the error was promptly rectified, many news carriers and blogs reported on it,[136] intensifying rumors concerning Jobs’s health.[137] Jobs responded at Apple’s September 2008 Let’s Rock keynote by paraphrasing Mark Twain: “Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.”[138][139] At a subsequent media event, Jobs concluded his presentation with a slide reading “110/70”, referring to his blood pressure, stating he would not address further questions about his health.[140]</p>\n <p>On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that marketing vice-president Phil Schiller would deliver the company’s final keynote address at the Macworld Conference and Expo 2009, again reviving questions about Jobs’s health.[141][142] In a statement given on January 5, 2009, on Apple.com, Jobs said that he had been suffering from a “hormone imbalance” for several months.[143][144]</p>\n <p>On January 14, 2009, Jobs wrote in an internal Apple memo that in the previous week he had “learned that my health-related issues are more complex than I originally thought”.[145] He announced a six-month leave of absence until the end of June 2009, to allow him to better focus on his health. Tim Cook, who previously acted as CEO in Jobs’s 2004 absence, became acting CEO of Apple, with Jobs still involved with “major strategic decisions”.[145]</p>\n <p>In 2009, Tim Cook offered a portion of his liver to Jobs, since both share a rare blood type. (The donor liver can regenerate tissue after such an operation.) Jobs yelled, “I’ll never let you do that. I’ll never do that.”[146]</p>\n <p>In April 2009, Jobs underwent a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in Memphis, Tennessee.[147][148][149] Jobs’s prognosis was described as “excellent”.[147]</p>\n <p>Resignation<br>\n On January 17, 2011, a year and a half after Jobs returned to work following the liver transplant, Apple announced that he had been granted a medical leave of absence. Jobs announced his leave in a letter to employees, stating his decision was made “so he could focus on his health.” As it did at the time of his 2009 medical leave, Apple announced that Tim Cook would run day-to-day operations and that Jobs would continue to be involved in major strategic decisions at the company.[150][151] Despite the leave, Jobs appeared at the iPad 2 launch event (March 2), the WWDC keynote introducing iCloud (June 6), and before the Cupertino City Council (June 7).[152]</p>\n <p>On August 24, 2011, Jobs announced his resignation as Apple’s CEO, writing to the board, “I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.”[153] Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor as CEO.[154][155] Jobs continued to work for Apple until the day before his death six weeks later.[156][157][158]</p>\n <p>Death</p>\n <p>Flags flying at half-staff outside Apple HQ in Cupertino, on the evening of Steve Jobs’s death</p>\n <p>Memorial candles and iPads pay tribute to Steve Jobs outside the Apple Store in Palo Alto, California, shortly after his death.<br>\n Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer,[44][159][160] which resulted in respiratory arrest.[161] He had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side.[90] His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: “Steve’s final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times. Before embarking, he’d looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life’s partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve’s final words were: ‘Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'” He then lost consciousness and died several hours later.[90] A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which were not revealed out of respect for Jobs’s family.[162] At the time of his death, his biological mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, was living in a nursing home and suffering from dementia. She was not told that he died.[89]</p>\n <p>Apple[163] and Pixar each issued announcements of his death.[164] Apple announced on the same day that they had no plans for a public service, but were encouraging “well-wishers” to send their remembrance messages to an email address created to receive such messages.[165] Apple and Microsoft both flew their flags at half-staff throughout their respective headquarters and campuses.[166][167] Bob Iger ordered all Disney properties, including Walt Disney World and Disneyland, to fly their flags at half-staff from October 6 to 12, 2011.[168] For two weeks following his death, Apple displayed on its corporate Web site a simple page that showed Jobs’s name and lifespan next to his grayscale portrait.[169][170][171] On October 19, 2011, Apple employees held a private memorial service for Jobs on the Apple campus in Cupertino. Jobs’s widow, Laurene, was in attendance, as well as Cook, Bill Campbell, Norah Jones, Al Gore, and Coldplay.[172] Some of Apple’s retail stores closed briefly so employees could attend the memorial. A video of the service was uploaded to Apple’s website.[172]</p>\n <p>Governor Jerry Brown of California declared Sunday, October 16, 2011, to be “Steve Jobs Day.”[173] On that day, an invitation-only memorial was held at Stanford University. Those in attendance included Apple and other tech company executives, members of the media, celebrities, close friends of Jobs, and politicians, along with Jobs’s family. Bono, Yo Yo Ma, and Joan Baez performed at the service, which lasted longer than an hour. The service was highly secured, with guards at all of the university’s gates, and a helicopter flying overhead from an area news station.[174][175] Each attendee was given a small brown box as a “farewell gift” from Jobs. The box contained a copy of the Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda.[176]</p>\n <p>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak,[177] former owner of what would become Pixar, George Lucas,[178] former rival, Microsoft founder Bill Gates,[179] and President Barack Obama[180] all offered statements in response to his death.</p>\n <p>Jobs is buried in an unmarked grave at Alta Mesa Memorial Park, the only nonsectarian cemetery in Palo Alto.[181][182]</p>\n <p>Portrayals and coverage in books, film, and theater</p>\n <p>Main article: List of artistic depictions of Steve Jobs<br>\n Steve Jobs is the subject of a number of books and films.</p>\n <p>Innovations and designs</p>\n <p>Jobs’s design aesthetic was influenced by the modernist architectural style of Joseph Eichler, by the industrial designs of Braun’s Dieter Rams, and by Buddhism. In India, he experienced Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey,[183] and his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied.[183]</p>\n <p>According to Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak “Steve didn’t ever code. He wasn’t an engineer and he didn’t do any original design…”[184][185] Daniel Kottke, one of Apple’s earliest employees and a college friend of Jobs’s, stated that “Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person.”[186]</p>\n <p>He is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves, lanyards and packages. Jobs’s contributions to most of his patents were to “the look and feel of the product.” His industrial design chief Jonathan Ive had his name along with him for 200 of the patents.[187] Most of these are design patents (specific product designs; for example, Jobs listed as primary inventor in patents for both original and lamp-style iMacs, as well as PowerBook G4 Titanium) as opposed to utility patents (inventions).[188][189] He has 43 issued US patents on inventions.[188] The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user interface with “magnification” feature was issued the day before he died.[190] Although Jobs had little involvement in the engineering and technical side of the original Apple computers,[185] Jobs later used his CEO position to directly involve himself with product design.[191]</p>\n <p>Even while terminally ill in the hospital, Jobs sketched new devices that would hold the iPad in a hospital bed.[192] He also despised the oxygen monitor on his finger and suggested ways to revise the design for simplicity.[193]</p>\n <p>Since his death, the former Apple CEO has won 141 patents, more than most inventors win during their lifetimes. Currently, Jobs holds over 450 patents.[194]</p>\n <p>Apple II<br>\n Main article: Apple II<br>\n The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products,[48] designed primarily by Steve Wozniak (Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II’s unusual case[11] and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply[49]). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer.</p>\n <p>Apple Lisa<br>\n Main article: Apple Lisa<br>\n The Lisa is a personal computer designed by Apple Computer, Inc. during the early 1980s. It was the first personal computer to offer a graphical user interface in a machine aimed at individual business users. Development of the Lisa began in 1978.[195] The Lisa sold poorly, with only 100,000 units sold.[196]</p>\n <p>In 1982, after Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project,[197] he joined the Macintosh project. The Macintosh is not a direct descendant of Lisa, although there are obvious similarities between the systems. The final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.[198]</p>\n <p>Macintosh<br>\n Main article: Macintosh<br>\n Jobs introduced the original Macintosh computer on January 24, 1984. This was the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse.[199] This first model was later renamed to “Macintosh 128k” for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models which are also based on Apple’s same proprietary architecture. Since 1998, Apple has largely phased out the Macintosh name in favor of “Mac”, though the product family has been nicknamed “Mac” or “the Mac” since the development of the first model. The Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, “1984”.[200] It most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, and is now considered a “watershed event”[201] and a “masterpiece.”[202] Regis McKenna called the ad “more successful than the Mac itself.”[203] “1984” used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the “conformity” of IBM’s attempts to dominate the computer industry. The ad alludes to George Orwell’s novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised “Big Brother.”[204][205]</p>\n <p>The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses.[206] Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade.</p>\n <p>NeXT Computer<br>\n Main article: NeXT Computer<br>\n After Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he started a company that built workstation computers. The NeXT Computer was introduced in 1988 at a lavish launch event. Tim Berners-Lee created the world’s first web browser (WorldWideWeb) using the NeXT Computer. The NeXT Computer was the basis for today’s macOS (formerly OS X) and iOS (formerly iPhone OS).[207][208]</p>\n <p>iMac<br>\n Main article: iMac<br>\n Apple iMac was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs’s return to Apple. Apple boasted “the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else’s.”[209] Described as “cartoonlike”, the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep.[210] The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. The iMac also featured some technical innovations, such as having USB ports as the only device inputs. This latter change resulted, through the iMac’s success, in the interface being popularised among third party peripheral makers – as evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).[211]</p>\n <p>iTunes<br>\n Main article: iTunes<br>\n iTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed by Apple Inc. It is used to play, download, and organize digital audio and video (as well as other types of media available on the iTunes Store) on personal computers running the macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems. The iTunes Store is also available on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad.</p>\n <p>Through the iTunes Store, users can purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, audiobooks, podcasts, movies, and movie rentals in some countries, and ringtones, available on the iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth generation onward). Application software for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch can be downloaded from the App Store.</p>\n <p>iPod<br>\n Main article: iPod<br>\n The first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8″ hard drive compared to the 2.5″ drives common to players at that time. The capacity of the first generation iPod ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB.[212] The iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001. The introduction of the iPod resulted in Apple becoming a major player in the music industry.[213] Also, the iPod’s success prepared the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone.[214] After the 1st generation of iPod, Apple released the hard drive-based iPod Classic, the touchscreen iPod Touch, video-capable iPod Nano, screenless iPod Shuffle in the following years.[213]</p>\n <p>iPhone<br>\n Main article: iPhone<br>\n Apple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007. The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of its release. Time Magazine declared it “Invention of the Year” for 2007.[215] The Apple iPhone is a small device with multimedia capabilities and functions as a quad-band touch screen smartphone.[216] A year later, the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 with three key features: support for GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA. In June 2009, the iPhone 3GS, whose improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a faster processor, was introduced by Phil Schiller.[217] The iPhone 4 is thinner than previous models, has a five megapixel camera capable of recording video in 720p HD, and adds a secondary front-facing camera for video calls.[218] A major feature of the iPhone 4S, introduced in October 2011, was Siri, a virtual assistant capable of voice recognition.[215]</p>\n <p>iPad<br>\n Main article: iPad</p>\n <p>Jobs introducing the iPad, San Francisco, January 27, 2010<br>\n iPad is an iOS-based line of tablet computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc.
