M. Humrichouse, daughter of Vice Admiral Huse; and commissioned 30 August 1943, Lt. Comdr. W. A. Sessions in command.\n\nContents 1\tWorld War II North Atlantic operations 2\tHunting for German Submarines 3\tEnd of War operations 4\tDecommissioning 5\tKorean War Reactivation 6\tCuban Missile Crisis operations 7\tDecommissioning 8\tAwards 9\tSee also 10\tReferences 11\tExternal links World War II North Atlantic operations Following exhaustive shakedown cruise off Bermuda, Huse returned to Charleston, South Carolina, 25 October 1943. She then moved to Norfolk, Virginia, for additional training before joining her first Atlantic convoy there 13 November. After seeing this convoy safely to Casablanca, she returned to New York Christmas Day 1943. Following training exercises off Norfolk, Virginia, Huse escorted another convoy to Africa 25 January-11 February 1944, then, before returning home, engaged in antisubmarine patrol work off Gibraltar with ships of the Royal Navy.\n\nReturning to New York 8 March, the ship was given a new assignment: to join escort carrier USS Croatan (CVE-25) antisubmarine group in the Atlantic. Sailing from Norfolk 24 March to search for U-boats, the ships were rewarded with contact 7 April.\n\nHunting for German Submarines The escorts dogged U-856 until it surfaced and was destroyed by gunfire from USS Huse and USS Champlin (DD-601). After a brief period at Bermuda, the group stood out to the search area again 12 April. Carrier aircraft and escort vessels came upon another submarine 26 April, and the destroyer escorts sank U-488.\n\nHuse spent the period 11 May – 3 June at Brooklyn, New York, departing the latter date with Croatan to search for submarines. They had not long to wait, beginning attacks on a submerged submarine the morning of 11 June. Six depth charge and two hedgehog runs brought no confirmation of a sinking, but the persistent ships remained in the area searching until just after midnight 12 June when, radar revealed a surfaced submarine. The badly damaged U-490 was finished off by gunfire. In the months that followed USS Huse continued to operate with the Croatan hunter-killer group that had much to do with keeping open the important supply lines to Europe. Replenishing as necessary at Norfolk, Bermuda, or Casablanca, they scoured the sea for enemy submarines. In addition, Huse rescued downed pilots from Croatan's air group on three separate occasions. She arrived Brooklyn 2 October 1944 for repairs and training, after which she conducted exercises in Chesapeake Bay and the Caribbean.\n\nHuse joined Croatan for hunter-killer operations again 25 March 1945, and two of her sister ships scored a kill on Type VII U-880 on 16 April 1945 in the Atlantic.

He was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in September 1874 and graduated in June 1878. He had extensive service at sea over the next decade, plus duty ashore, notably at the Naval Academy, where he would have several staff tours in the course of his career. During the 1898 Spanish–American War Lieutenant Huse was Executive Officer of the gunboat USS Gloucester (1891), taking part in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba and leading a party ashore that first raised the U.S. flag over Puerto Rico. In the early 1900s Lieutenant Commander Huse was stationed in the Philippines, where he commanded the gunboat USS Villalobos (PG-42). This was followed by nearly five years at the Naval Academy as, among other things, instructor of mathematics.\n\nMidshipman Harry Huse, U.S. Naval Academy photo Promoted to the rank of Commander in 1907, Huse was commanding officer of the monitor USS Nevada (BM-8) and later of the supply ship USS Celtic (AF-2). After his next promotion, to Captain late in 1909, he was Captain of the Yard at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, commanded the battleship USS Vermont (BB-20) and, in 1914-1915, was Chief of Staff to Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher. He attended the Naval War College, graduating in 1915.\n\nHuse reached the rank of Rear Admiral in mid-1916, while at the War College. He held Navy Department positions through the World War I years, followed in 1919 by command of the Atlantic Training Fleet. From late 1919 to early 1921 he served abroad, initially as senior U.S. Navy representative on the Inter-Allied Naval Armistice Commission and the Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control, then as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in European Waters, with the temporary rank of Vice Admiral. After returning to the United States he was Commandant of the Third Naval District, headquartered at New York City, and as a member of the Navy's General Board. Rear Admiral Huse left active duty in December 1922, later receiving the retirement rank of Vice Admiral.\n\nHuse was a Washington, D.C., resident for the rest of his life. He co-authored a book on genealogy entitled The Descendants of Abel Huse of Newbury (1602–1690), published in 1935. Harry Huse died at Bethesda Naval Hospital, in suburban Maryland, on May 14, 1942. He is buried with his wife, Mary Sheward Whitelock, in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington County, Virginia.\n\nMedal of Honor citation As a result of his conduct during the landings at Vera Cruz, Mexico, in April 1914, Captain Huse was awarded the Medal of Honor. His official Medal of Honor citation reads:\n\nHis first name was given as Henry on the citation.\n\nCitation:\n\nFor distinguished conduct in battle, engagements of Vera Cruz, 21 and 22 April 1914. Under fire, Captain Huse was eminent and conspicuous in the performance of his duties; was indefatigable in his labors of a most important character, both with the division commander in directing affairs and in his efforts on shore to get in communication with the Mexican authorities to avoid needlessly prolonging the conflict.

M. Humrichouse, daughter of Vice Admiral Huse; and commissioned 30 August 1943, Lt. Comdr. W. A.

She then moved to Norfolk, Virginia, for additional training before joining her first Atlantic convoy there 13 November. After seeing this convoy safely to Casablanca, she returned to New York Christmas Day 1943. Following training exercises off Norfolk, Virginia, Huse escorted another convoy to Africa 25 January-11 February 1944, then, before returning home, engaged in antisubmarine patrol work off Gibraltar with ships of the Royal Navy.</p>\n\n<p>Returning to New York 8 March, the ship was given a new assignment: to join escort carrier USS Croatan (CVE-25) antisubmarine group in the Atlantic. Sailing from Norfolk 24 March to search for U-boats, the ships were rewarded with contact 7 April.</p>\n\n<p>Hunting for German Submarines The escorts dogged U-856 until it surfaced and was destroyed by gunfire from USS Huse and USS Champlin (DD-601). After a brief period at Bermuda, the group stood out to the search area again 12 April. Carrier aircraft and escort vessels came upon another submarine 26 April, and the destroyer escorts sank U-488.</p>\n\n<p>Huse spent the period 11 May – 3 June at Brooklyn, New York, departing the latter date with Croatan to search for submarines. They had not long to wait, beginning attacks on a submerged submarine the morning of 11 June. Six depth charge and two hedgehog runs brought no confirmation of a sinking, but the persistent ships remained in the area searching until just after midnight 12 June when, radar revealed a surfaced submarine. The badly damaged U-490 was finished off by gunfire. In the months that followed USS Huse continued to operate with the Croatan hunter-killer group that had much to do with keeping open the important supply lines to Europe. Replenishing as necessary at Norfolk, Bermuda, or Casablanca, they scoured the sea for enemy submarines. In addition, Huse rescued downed pilots from Croatan's air group on three separate occasions. She arrived Brooklyn 2 October 1944 for repairs and training, after which she conducted exercises in Chesapeake Bay and the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p>Huse joined Croatan for hunter-killer operations again 25 March 1945, and two of her sister ships scored a kill on Type VII U-880 on 16 April 1945 in the Atlantic. They continued to operate in northern waters out of Argentia, Newfoundland, until returning to New York 14 May 1945.</p>\n\n<p>End of War operations The war against Germany over, Huse prepared to join the Pacific Fleet for the final effort to defeat Japan. She sailed 10 July 1945 for training exercises in the Caribbean, passing through the Panama Canal and arriving San Diego, California, 7 August 1945. During the voyage to Pearl Harbor, the ship learned of Japan's collapse 15 August. After various exercises in Hawaiian waters, the veteran escort ship returned to Norfolk via San Diego and the Canal Zone 28 September 1945.</p>\n\n<p>Decommissioning She, subsequently, arrived Green Cove Springs, Florida, 19 January 1946; decommissioned 27 March ; and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.</p>\n\n<p>Korean War Reactivation Huse recommissioned in response to the increased needs of the U.S. Navy during the Korean War 3 August 1951. After shakedown training in the Caribbean, she arrived Key West, Florida, 15 January 1952 to act as sonar-training ship. In May she steamed northward to take part in a cold-weather operation off Labrador. The ship then 'began regular training operations, based at Newport, Rhode Island, taking her to the Caribbean and Key West. This antisubmarine readiness training was maintained until July 1955 when the ship sailed to Norfolk to embark NROTC Midshipmen on a training cruise to Northern Europe. Huse returned to Newport 3 September 1955 and resumed antisubmarine operations. This continued until early 1957 when she made preparations to join the Navy task group operating off the Atlantic Missile Eastern Test Range.</p>\n\n<p>During May 1957 Huse operated off Puerto Rico in connection with the launching of a Vanguard satellite test vehicle, and the subsequent nose cone recovery efforts. After further tactical exercises at Key West, she sailed in September for important NATO exercises in Northern European waters, returning to Newport 21 October 1957. During 1958 and 1959, except for short cruises to the Caribbean and periodic overhaul, USS Huse remained in the Key West area on sonar-training operations.</p>\n\n<p>Huse was assigned 'to the Naval Reserve Training program in March 1960, and for the next three months carried out training cruises with reservists from New York and Norfolk. She arrived New Orleans, her new home port, 6 July 1960 to begin reserve training cruises.</p>\n\n<p>Cuban Missile Crisis operations In October 1962, when the introduction of offensive missiles into Cuba brought on Just such a demand, Huse promptly steamed to Florida to bolster Naval strength in support of the blockade.</p>\n\n<p>Decommissioning Through 1963 into 1965 she continued to operate out of New Orleans in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean performing her vital training function. In June 1965 Huse decommissioned and was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk, Virginia. She was part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in August 1973, and was sold for scrapping in June 1974.</p>\n\n<p>Huse was named in honor of Vice Admiral Harry McL. P. Huse, (1858–1942), whose long service included a post-World War I tour as Commander U.S. Naval Forces in European Waters.</p>\n\n<p>Awards Huse received five battle stars for World War II service.</p>\n\n<p>See also \tWikimedia Commons has media related to USS Huse (DE-145).

He was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in September 1874 and graduated in June 1878. He had extensive service at sea over the next decade, plus duty ashore, notably at the Naval Academy, where he would have several staff tours in the course of his career. During the 1898 Spanish–American War Lieutenant Huse was Executive Officer of the gunboat USS Gloucester (1891), taking part in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba and leading a party ashore that first raised the U.S. flag over Puerto Rico. In the early 1900s Lieutenant Commander Huse was stationed in the Philippines, where he commanded the gunboat USS Villalobos (PG-42). This was followed by nearly five years at the Naval Academy as, among other things, instructor of mathematics.</p>\n\n<p>Midshipman Harry Huse, U.S. Naval Academy photo Promoted to the rank of Commander in 1907, Huse was commanding officer of the monitor USS Nevada (BM-8) and later of the supply ship USS Celtic (AF-2). After his next promotion, to Captain late in 1909, he was Captain of the Yard at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, commanded the battleship USS Vermont (BB-20) and, in 1914-1915, was Chief of Staff to Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher. He attended the Naval War College, graduating in 1915.</p>\n\n<p>Huse reached the rank of Rear Admiral in mid-1916, while at the War College. He held Navy Department positions through the World War I years, followed in 1919 by command of the Atlantic Training Fleet. From late 1919 to early 1921 he served abroad, initially as senior U.S. Navy representative on the Inter-Allied Naval Armistice Commission and the Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control, then as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in European Waters, with the temporary rank of Vice Admiral. After returning to the United States he was Commandant of the Third Naval District, headquartered at New York City, and as a member of the Navy's General Board. Rear Admiral Huse left active duty in December 1922, later receiving the retirement rank of Vice Admiral.</p>\n\n<p>Huse was a Washington, D.C., resident for the rest of his life. He co-authored a book on genealogy entitled The Descendants of Abel Huse of Newbury (1602–1690), published in 1935. Harry Huse died at Bethesda Naval Hospital, in suburban Maryland, on May 14, 1942. He is buried with his wife, Mary Sheward Whitelock, in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington County, Virginia.</p>\n\n<p>Medal of Honor citation As a result of his conduct during the landings at Vera Cruz, Mexico, in April 1914, Captain Huse was awarded the Medal of Honor. His official Medal of Honor citation reads:</p>\n\n<p>His first name was given as Henry on the citation.</p>\n\n<p>Citation:</p>\n\n<p>For distinguished conduct in battle, engagements of Vera Cruz, 21 and 22 April 1914. Under fire, Captain Huse was eminent and conspicuous in the performance of his duties; was indefatigable in his labors of a most important character, both with the division commander in directing affairs and in his efforts on shore to get in communication with the Mexican authorities to avoid needlessly prolonging the conflict. Namesake In 1943, USS Huse (DE-145) was named in honor of Vice Admiral Harry M. P. Huse.</p>\n\n<p>See also \tBiography portal List of Medal of Honor recipients (Veracruz) References</p>\n\n<pre>This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the Naval History &amp; Heritage Command.</pre>\n<p>\"Harry M.
