                    Plagiarism-Are we all thieves?

"He who imitates must have a care that what he writes be similar, not identical... and that the similarity should not be of the kind that obtains between a portrait and a sitter, where the artist earns more praise the greater the likeness, but rather of the kind that obtains between a son and his father...we (too) should take care that... what is like should be hidden as to be grasped only by the mind's silent enquiry. We should therefore make use of another man's inner quality and tone, but avoid his words. For the one kind of similarity is hidden and the other protrudes; the one creates poets, the other apes."                                  - Petrarch, Le familiari, XXIII

The word Plagiarism came from the Latin word “plagiaries” literally meaning   a “kidnapper”. This use of the word was introduced into English in 1601 by dramatist Ben Jonson, to describe as a plagiary someone guilty of literary theft. Plagiarism is the "wrongful appropriation" and "purloining and publication" of another author's "language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions," and presenting them as one's own original work.

In literature and in the visual arts, from the Renaissance onwards, a canon of models encouraged artists to engage in copying or imitation from other artists' works. Originality, if it exists at all, is not an absolute state; its identification is subject to a scale of relative values and knowledge, it is conditional to time and place.

Brown defines plagiarism as "...appropriating another person's ideas or words (spoken or written) without attributing those word or ideas to their true source." Oxford characterizes plagiarism as the use of "a writer's ideas or phraseology without giving due credit”. 

Mere copying and imitation are different things. In imitation, there is a degree of generalisation which avoids the risk of direct quotation, permitting the imitator to move within his or her own imagination. Copying is simply mimicking the other’s work without any intellectual element by the copier.

Plagiarism is considered an academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics. Plagiarism is not a crime per se, but in academia and in industry, it is a serious ethical offense.
Plagiarism is not the same as copyright infringement. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience.

Why People Plagiarize
Plagiarism is a phenomenon that takes place everywhere around us. Some people plagiarize unknowingly because they do not know what may amount to it. Others plagiarize willingly as they are simply ignorant or lazy. Students are the greatest culprits of plagiarism, when it comes to doing their school/college projects. The reasons why students plagiarize in large numbers are many. Some of them are:

•Less time
• Procrastination
• Ambition of achieving higher grades
•Lack of knowledge
•Lack of patience
•No trust in one's own ability
•Sheer lethargy
•Ignorance about the consequences of plagiarism

Whatever the reason may be, plagiarism is an offensive act that leads to infraction of originality. A person should try to avoid any such act as far as possible, and cite appropriate references in his work, wherever necessary.

Types of Plagiarism
Academic and journalistic plagiarism is an age-old practice. However, Internet plagiarism is now prevalent in a big way. Moreover, plagiarism has taken many new forms. Now, it is just about cut, copy and paste, or a little rephrasing.  1. Full Plagiarism or complete Plagiarism: Whenever the full content from an author is copied by another without even changing the sentence, word or even...

Along with the definition with plagiarism, there is also a discussion of why students plagiarize. Plagiarism have become a major problem in academic institutions due to the clever ways that students misuse scholarly information for their own benefit of learning and understanding the information presented in the courses that they are enrolled in. This examination of                                     plagiarism will also review the topics of intentional versus unintentional plagiarism, how to properly cite a paper by using direct quoting, paraphrasing and citing references. In the computer age, the fear is that students will use the internet to obtain analysis, interpretation or even complete assignments and then submit these as their own work. Plagiarism is not just limited to academics, but also in our whole multimedia society.  

















What Is Plagiarism?

Helen Johnson
Liberty University  

Plagiarism is a problem that many people face daily whether it is a student struggling with a research paper or an advertising agent trying to get new ideas together for a sales pitch. Is plagiarism limited only to a student using material copied from a book without giving credit to the author or for turning in a paper that a friend wrote for another university? Would a student who acknowledged                                     that he/she got the information for a research paper from a source but recorded the wrong source be just as guilty of plagiarism as a person who copied information from journals without giving any reference to the journals at all? In order to understand the reasons plagiarism is committed it is important first to ensure that it is properly defined. According to Merriam-Webster’s online dictionary, plagiarism is defined as the act of stealing or passing off the ideas or words of another as one’s own or to use someone else’s work without crediting the source. Plagiarism can be divided into two different types, intentional and unintentional. Intentional plagiarism is the act of purposely and knowingly passing another person’s work as one’s. Unintentional plagiarism is conducted due to lack of proper knowledge of what plagiarism means or how to correctly cite works utilized.

Plagiarism is known as literary theft and is when somebody knowingly takes somebody else’s ideas or words as if they were their own and not providing due credit.  With the fast paced life style of students today, plagiarism is as easy as copy, paste and done.  Many students have a catch me if you can mentality and since the penalties are sometimes not that severe if                                     caught, students are willing to take the risk.  With the online college courses available, people of all ages are going back to school.  Most older students find school more difficult and time consuming than it was years ago and with job and family responsibilities, search the internet, copy bits and pieces from articles, blogs or school sites, not even thinking they are plagiarizing and completing a report in a fraction of the time spent doing a report before the internet. A long night in the library, gathering a fact from encyclopedias, newspapers, magazines and books was when plagiarizing was difficult and easily detected.  Cut and paste was clipping articles from professional journalist and pasting them onto paper with Elmer’s glue.  Now it is very easy to gather large amounts of information, cut and paste it into word processing software and forget to put the author or some quotes around copied passages.  At least most colleges have some sort of formatting such as ADA that requires...

Plagiarism: Why it Continues to Occur?
	The increase in plagiarism has gained the attention of many institutions, administrators and educators, as well as researchers and the public. This increase has brought to attention the concern of why plagiarism continues to occur. In order to debate this concern we should                                     first understand the definition and background of plagiarism, the factors which influence plagiarism, and what is or is not being done to prevent it. I will be looking into three articles in which my discussion will be based on. These articles include “Combating Plagiarism” by Brian Hansen, “Internet Plagiarism Among College Students” by Patrick M. Scanlon and David R. Newman, and “Plagiarism-A Survey” by Hermann Maurer, Frank Kappe, and Bilal Zaka.
	Defining plagiarism may be a difficult task because plagiarism can have more than one meaning. Plagiarism is “derived from the Latin word plagiarius,” meaning kidnapper (Hansen, 2003, p. 775). It is “a form of cheating that has been defined as the false assumption of authorship: the wrongful act of taking the product of another person’s mind, and presenting it as one’s own” (Modern Language Association as cited in Hansen, 2003, p....

Academic Plagiarism


1.0 Defining academic plagiarism
The practice of stealing another person’s academic work and presenting it as your own is defined as academic plagiarism. This is a growing vice among students in our institutions of higher learning today. Most students in our local universities steal other persons’ writings or related academic materials and present such works as their original work. Academic plagiarism is when a person steals another person’s works and passes it on as his or her original work (Gibaldi, 1998).
2.0 What are different types of academic plagiarism?
There are several types of academic plagiarism. According to Loveleena Rajeev (2012), there are six types of academic plagiarism. The first is partial plagiarism. This...

Plagiarism is the purloining and publication of another author’s language, thoughts, ideas or expressions, and the representation of them as one’s own original work.
The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal, emerged in Europe only in the 18th century, particularly with the Romantic Movement.
This concept for artist is to “copy the masters as closely as possible” and avoid unnecessary invention                                     
In the 18th century in the sectors of academy and journalism, where plagiarism is now considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics, subject to sanctions like expulsion. But in the 20th century this practice has been heightened as the central and representative artistic device.
Plagiarism is not a crime per se but is disapproved more on the grounds of moral offence, and cases of plagiarism can involve liability for copyright infringement. 	


Legal aspects 
Thought plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing from the point of view of the law, it is an non existing concept “plagiarism is not mentioned in any current statue, either criminal civil. Some cases may be treated as unfair competition or violation of the doctrine of moral rights.
