arm is a complex and essential body part that allows for a wide range of movements and actions. It is made up of the shoulder, the upper arm, the elbow, the forearm, and the hand.\nThe shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, allowing for a wide range of motion in all directions. It is made up of the ball and socket joint, which is formed by the head of the humerus (upper arm bone) and the scapula (shoulder blade). This joint is held together by a group of muscles, tendons, and ligaments, including the rotator cuff, which is a group of four muscles that work to stabilize the shoulder.\nThe upper arm bone, or humerus, connects the shoulder to the elbow. The elbow joint is a hinge joint, which allows for movement in only two directions: flexion and extension. The forearm is made up of two bones: the radius and the ulna. The radius and ulna rotate around each other, allowing for the movement of the wrist and hand.\nThe musculocutaneous nerve, from C5, C6, C7, is the main supplier of muscles of the anterior compartment. It originates from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus of nerves. It pierces the coracobrachialis muscle and gives off branches to the muscle, as well as to brachialis and biceps brachii. It terminates as the anterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm.\nThe radial nerve, which is from the fifth cervical spinal nerve to the first thoracic spinal nerve, originates as the continuation of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. This nerve enters the lower triangular space (an imaginary space bounded by, amongst others, the shaft of the humerus and the triceps brachii) of the arm and lies deep to the triceps brachii. Here it travels with the deep artery of the arm, which sits in the radial groove of the humerus. This fact is very important clinically as a fracture of the shaft of the bone here can cause lesions or even transections in the nerve.\nThe hand is made up of the wrist, the palm, and the fingers. The wrist is made up of eight small bones, called the carpal bones, which are connected to the bones of the forearm. The palm is made up of five bones, called the metacarpals, which connect to the fingers. The fingers are made up of three bones, called the phalanges. The bones of the hand are connected to muscles and tendons, which allow for the movement and manipulation of objects.\nThe arm is controlled by a complex network of nerves and muscles. The brachial plexus, a network of nerves, provides the main nerve supply to the arm, while the muscles of the arm are divided into three groups: the rotator cuff muscles, the upper arm muscles, and the forearm and hand muscles.\nIn human anatomy, the arm refers to the upper limb in common usage, although academically the term specifically means the upper arm[1][2] between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint. The distal part of the upper limb between the elbow and the radiocarpal joint (wrist joint) is known as the forearm or \"lower\" arm, and the extremity beyond the wrist is the hand.\nBy anatomical definitions, the bones, ligaments and skeletal muscles of the shoulder girdle, as well as the axilla between them, is considered parts of the upper limb, and thus also components of the arm.

The radius and ulna rotate around each other, allowing for the movement of the wrist and hand.\nThe musculocutaneous nerve, from C5, C6, C7, is the main supplier of muscles of the anterior compartment. It originates from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus of nerves. It pierces the coracobrachialis muscle and gives off branches to the muscle, as well as to brachialis and biceps brachii. It terminates as the anterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm.\nThe radial nerve, which is from the fifth cervical spinal nerve to the first thoracic spinal nerve, originates as the continuation of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. This nerve enters the lower triangular space (an imaginary space bounded by, amongst others, the shaft of the humerus and the triceps brachii) of the arm and lies deep to the triceps brachii. Here it travels with the deep artery of the arm, which sits in the radial groove of the humerus. This fact is very important clinically as a fracture of the shaft of the bone here can cause lesions or even transections in the nerve.\nThe hand is made up of the wrist, the palm, and the fingers. The wrist is made up of eight small bones, called the carpal bones, which are connected to the bones of the forearm. The palm is made up of five bones, called the metacarpals, which connect to the fingers. The fingers are made up of three bones, called the phalanges. The bones of the hand are connected to muscles and tendons, which allow for the movement and manipulation of objects.\nThe arm is controlled by a complex network of nerves and muscles. The brachial plexus, a network of nerves, provides the main nerve supply to the arm, while the muscles of the arm are divided into three groups: the rotator cuff muscles, the upper arm muscles, and the forearm and hand muscles.\nIn human anatomy, the arm refers to the upper limb in common usage, although academically the term specifically means the upper arm[1][2] between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint. The distal part of the upper limb between the elbow and the radiocarpal joint (wrist joint) is known as the forearm or \"lower\" arm, and the extremity beyond the wrist is the hand.\nBy anatomical definitions, the bones, ligaments and skeletal muscles of the shoulder girdle, as well as the axilla between them, is considered parts of the upper limb, and thus also components of the arm. The Latin term brachium, which serves as a root word for naming many anatomical structures, may refer to either the upper limb as a whole or to the upper arm on its own\n\nThe arm is a complex and essential body part that allows for a wide range of movements and actions. It is made up of the shoulder, the upper arm, the elbow, the forearm, and the hand.\nThe shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, allowing for a wide range of motion in all directions. It is made up of the ball and socket joint, which is formed by the head of the humerus (upper arm bone) and the scapula (shoulder blade). This joint is held together by a group of muscles, tendons, and ligaments, including the rotator cuff, which is a group of four muscles that work to stabilize the shoulder.\nThe upper arm bone, or humerus, connects the shoulder to the elbow. The elbow joint is a hinge joint, which allows for movement in only two directions: flexion and extension. The forearm is made up of two bones: the radius and the ulna. The radius and ulna rotate around each other, allowing for the movement of the wrist and hand.\nThe musculocutaneous nerve, from C5, C6, C7, is the main supplier of muscles of the anterior compartment.
