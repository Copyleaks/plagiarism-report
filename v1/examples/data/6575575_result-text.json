Missing My Daily Dose of Conversations







Since Thursday, I have put in nearly 50 or so hours with the new internship.  It has been tiring and partially stressful.  Working on a big project and cutting down to the wire to get some of the 3D modeling and animation done.  The gig is a lot of fun and I am learning a lot every day, even when I stare at the screen for several hours trying to figure out how to blow something up in the software (at least blow it up in a way so it does not look like crap.  Wood should not ooze out polygons making it look like it's made of rubble).

But working all of these hours comes at the great expense of talking on the phone, for countless hours (it's a phrase, I could probably count the hours if I really wanted to).  I am so used to waiting, talking, arguing, and listening on the phone with Alejandra daily that the days, like today, where I do not get a chance to talk to her much, the day feels like it missing something. 

Not talking with Alejandra is not the only daily dose of conversation I am used to having; I also try to talk to my mother daily.  That, too, is proving a difficult task when I am spending a lot of my time working.  Not having these conversations does not ruin my day, but making sure those connections stay strong is very vital to me. 

Every time I have left one place and wound up in another, connections between people get weaker.  I always assume, with the technology of today, that conversations and connections should be easier to maintain with people over large distances but this assumption is incorrect.  If two people are not in similar vicinities, even with technology, keeping a strong connection between one another can be very difficult.  On the other hand, however, both parties are experiences different worlds that each can share, which is very good for conversation.  But the other member may not be able to relate as easily as two people living near one another experiences more similar life events.

I found it disheartening last year (and even still), when I left graduate school, that the people I met, the acquaintances I have made hardly exist in my life anymore.  I talk to maybe three to five people tops that I went to school with, one of which I never would have expected to have grown so close to.  And with the other few that I may interact with, I feel I am always the one working to keep the connection.  Maybe it is selfish of me to want to keep people close.  This observation, however, was not only witnessed since leaving graduate school, but also occurred when I finished high school and my undergraduate studies.  And again, interestingly, some of the people I disliked during both those periods of my life have become really good friends.

What I am trying to get at quickly and concisely (since I have to get up in five hours for my internship) is that it is important to keep in touch with people, constantly, in order to keep the connection strong.  I once asked my friend Chris Johnston how he and his wife made things work, since they lived such a far distance from one another.  His answer was that they made a point to talk every day, no matter how hard it may be.  Through their constant devotion to keep the connection and talk, they have been together for several years and now nearly married for one year.

Although I am devoting a lot of time to making my career path more clear and doing what I love, and as hard as it is right now to talk to the people I care the most for, I am doing my best to be sure to be there for the waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and an argument or two, and maybe a serious conversation mixed within.

Technology







During this summer, I broke my screen on my phone.  The cost of such a repair runs about $60-$80 at the Verizon store.  I, however, feel I am pretty tech savvy and can handle my own repairs.  I have built computers and a done a lot of other things with technology, how hard could fixing a mobile phone screen be?

Well, fixing this wretched piece of cellular technology has been a bitch.  Ordering the part was the easiest.  Just went to Ebay, found the screen, new, and purchased.  When it arrived, I was all full of glee so that I wouldn't have to use a cracked screen anymore.

Open it up, and lo and behold, the damn thing uses torx screws.  WTF?!  So, I hop in the car, drive to Wal-mart to find a T3 Torx screwdriver.  First off, this Walmart has shit backwards.  I went to go to the hardware section, which is usually by the auto section.  Nope.  Not the Porter Ranch one.  They hide all of their tools between grocery and electronics. I make my way over to the tools section to find torx screwdrivers, and...what do you know.  Wal-mart only carries one set of torx keys and they are completely out (although, I also came to find out that the smallest size on the key is not small enough).

From there, I venture to Best Buy.  Surely, Best Buy would carry such items to repair pieces of technology.  I walk in, am pointed towards home theater, find some screwdrivers.  An employee offers to open up the set to see if they fit, if I would purchase the product if it does work.  Simple agreement for me.  So the clerk attempts to open with an actual knife, nearly cuts himself before choosing a pair of scissors.  The clerk, after telling me about how he nearly lost a finger cutting himself when trying to stab his father as a child (or something like that) finally opens the case.  No torx screws at all.  Waste of time.

Best Buy Mobile directs me to a cell phone repair place.  I call assuming a place that repairs phones would carry the tools to fix phones too.  Nope.  Not this place.  Next stop, Lowes.

Lowes has a lot of tools.  But they did not have anything below a T10 torx when I called.

I stop by some local Mom and Pop hardware store to find the key that Wal-mart would have carried, and true, it does not fit.

Last resort.  Radio shack.  To my surprise, Radio Shack actually carries a small kit for repairing mobile phones.  Winner, winner.  Chicken Dinner.  So I shelve over the $20 and am on my way home to repair my phone.

A run in, a new found boy about to embrace the manhood that is fixing a mobile phone screen.  I pop off the edges surrounding the four front torx screws.  Grab the smallest torx screwdriver in kit and start to work some magic on my phone.  I follow the YouTube directions  precisely.  I get everything off.  Now for the final stretch, getting the faceplate off.  And...shitballs!! I still need a smaller torx screwdriver to get the rest of the 8 remaining screws before my phone can be fixed.

Googled "T3 Torx Screwdriver" and found a quick hit for a $2.99 with $4.99 shipping. Paypal, purchase, check-out. 

A few days later, yesterday, I receive the torx screwdriver in a bubblewrapped inner manila envelope.  Sweet I can finally get this thing finish.  After the tedious unscrewing and unsnapping of parts, I finally get back to where I was a week or so ago.  I get to the last T3 torx screw and...eff this game.  The screw head basically seems or quickly became stripped with no effort.  God really must hate me and this phone right now.  So I do what every man does, I figure out the best way to take it apart ignoring the fact there there is a screw holding everything together still.  I tear out the old screen, put in the new screen.  Start rescrewing (one of which was being a little bitch about going in the hole).  I get near the finish line, notice the phone is not snapping perfectly together and finish the final screws.  I get it all back together (minus the section that does not want to snap back together) and lying in front of my, on my desk, is some computer looking piece that probably belongs in the phone somewhere.

I do not know where it belonged nor, at this moment, do I care.  The screen works, for now, and I will see what does not work tomorrow.  Moral of this adventure? Sometimes technology is a bitch and you have to make do with the means available.  Also, sometimes spending the extra money for someone else to fix these problems takes a lot of stress away when you do notice pieces where they should have been when finished.

Gifts







With the wrong address, a gift can take two weeks to arrive at your doorstep.  Today, I received my birthday gifts from Alejandra and I would like to say I love the items.  An elephant figure and a new blanket.  But getting the gifts got me thinking about myself and how I often feel about gifts.

Growing up, I knew what I wanted every year for my birthday and for Christmas.  Both lists ALWAYS had video games and LEGOS.  As I grew older, however, my lists became shorter (although video games and LEGOS still exist on the lists today).  When asked what I want for presents I usually just ask for money because it helps pay the bills.

Some family members hate giving money because they think gifts are a necessity for the holidays.  I really have not decided what I think about the issue, other than money pays my bills which lets me live with a little less stress.  But gift giving, for me, however, has always been a tough subject.  I have never really been in a great position to afford nice gifts for people; and, although the adage states that it is the thought that counts, I often worry about whether that is true. 

For example, as a hyperbole, say I give someone a really nice antique art piece.  This hypothetical gift expresses that I have money that I can spend and am willing to spend it on said recipient.  On the other hand, however, say I draw a simple picture that costs me barely anything.  This could state I am cheap, cannot afford much of anything, but I took the time to make this gift.  Comparing two gifts, of great difference, on qualitative properties is a difficult task.  How can one be better than the other?

Society shows that money equals success and power.  Positions we all wish to accomplish.  With money we have accomplished the fight against person poverty and starvation.  But when we wish to be generous to one another, even the slightest gift can be worth the thousand dollar antique painting.

I only bring this up because I, in my head, compare what I get for people and what I receive.  Hopefully, when we each gift and receive, the gifts equal out in some measurable and immeasurable means.  I am not trying to downgrade my gifts I received at all.  I love both that I received and I hope that she, in return, appreciates the birthday gift I gave just as much as I appreciate these two items.  They each serve a different purpose and hold a different attachment.  But, in this case, the thought does count that we each, impoverished by our own perspectives, were able to give something, if nothing more than a homemade birthday card and a box of playing cards.

Tolerance







A YCTC student of mine posted this link yesterday and it really got me thinking about tolerance and what that really means.

Skinning Chick-fil-A

Without going into my religious or political positions at the moment, I think the biggest thing this guy brings up is the Left's (and honestly, both sides do this) need to indoctrinate tolerance while being intolerant to those that believe differently.  From the debate I had on Facebook, I wrote:

To play the devil's advocate 
here, Francis.  The anti-civil rights movement is only considered such 
to those that are believing they are entitled to some arbitrary rights. 
 Some companies run on a Christian basis look at homosexuality through a
 lens in which, according to their beliefs, homosexuality is not natural
 and, thus, by such an argument, are not entitled to the same civil 
rights as those of the "traditional marriage."  To the Christian 
doctrine, it is not necessarily an anti-civil rights movement but a 
movement to uphold their beliefs that they were brought up with in the 
church.  On the other hand, those that wish to extend all rights
 to everyone no matter beliefs, see this as an attack on their way of 
life.  I think, however, it is important to note, that no one is 
standing up for the polygamists or the interspecies relationships.  
Maybe those people wish to have their beliefs protected by the same 
civil rights argument that is going on in the country.
This comment was in response to someone saying that Boston and Chicago, in response to Chick-fil-A, are not worrying about the issue from the business transaction point of view but rather they do not want to support an "anti-civil rights movement."  As you can see from my post above, I defend the Church in its position on their fight from the religious point of view and their standpoint of the traditional marriage.  These, to the church, are beliefs they are trying to protect while the rest of the United States fights against their ability to follow their religion and its beliefs. 

From the secular point of view, religion aside, it would seem like a fight against civil liberties.  But this is definitely a severely complex issue.  We, as a collective within this nation, strive to separate church and state, but when the morals we try to live by are affected by the laws currently passed or laws we try to pass, how can one not invade the other? 

The only way to ever keep separation from church and state enacted is to let people decide whom they are to marry and leave the state out of it.  If gays want to get married, just let them.  If Christians want to get married, they can.  Where, in both the Constitution and the Bible, does it say marriage has to be indoctrinated by the law of the country?  Why cannot people give other people the responsibilities and benefits that the government grants, such as with medical care and dying wishes?  Why does marriage have to be taxable or a deductable?  Cannot two people just love each other and live as they please?  Or, if we are to take this civil rights argument farther (because whose to say that if the gays and lesbians win, more fetish induced groups will want their "rights" protected to) that the polygamists or interspeciesists will not try to fight for their marriages?

Continuation of my Facebook response:

The real
 problem with all of politics, and the term tolerance itself, is that to
 be tolerant is utterly impossible.  Tolerance demands that there be 
something intolerant that has to be accepted.  People would literally 
have to allow every belief, every system of relationship, every person's
 own choices, to be tolerant.  These are things we neighbors, as 
Americans, as humans, cannot do.  Everyone must pick and choose their 
battles.  The Christians are fighting to protect their beliefs, which is
 seen as intolerance.  The politics fighting against the Christian's 
intolerance, is not, however, an act of tolerance, but an act of 
intolerance as well.
There is no such thing as ultimate tolerance.  There are things we cannot be tolerant of, such as mass-murder, theft, fraud.  Even tolerance makes the subject of gay marraige more complex.  If you do not support gay marriage, you are intolerant to those who believe they are born to love the same sex and thus against equal rights.  But if you are for gay marriage, as a Christian, you are intolerant of the belief system that you are, inherently, supposed to follow before any other decisions.

So before both sides start spouting whether Chick-fil-A should be condemned for their CEO, think about the secular view, that this is a business thriving to make a profit in a struggling economy.  Who cares that the CEO is against gay marriage.  That is his right as a practicing Christian.  I'm sure he is not out there checking every business he puts money in to find out whether or not it goes to the gays.  Just do business with it.  People boycotting Chick-fil-A for their CEO's beliefs is just as ridiculous as the people boycotting Kraft/Oreo for supporting gay marriage.

Everyone wants others to be tolerant, only when it is convenient for themselves and their own beliefs.

Conclusion from Facebook:

Whatever anyone else believes, there will 
always be others that disagree.  I do find it strange, however, that the
 nation really only looks at the Christians belief of homosexuality, 
granted it seems to be the one fighting against it the most.  But, 
luckily, the Islamics have not come into the argument because according 
to their religion in 1991, sodomy was punishable by death and in 2005, 
gays were arrested, imprisoned, and flogged for their conduct.  
Christians are more tolerant than that at least.

 I think things would have been easier if Jesus had just a few gay friends he hung out with and then we could really read understand what he would have done.  The gays, without a doubt, had to be the ones behind Joseph's Technicolor Dream Coat...

Sleepy







Today has been a long, tiring day.  I started a new internship, which went really well.  The bad part is I need to get a good night's sleep.  I have not slept well in several weeks and I have yet to really figure out why.  Staying up late or not eating properly may be the underlying causes but I am not sure.

So, other than my plagiarism post, I really do not have a lot to say tonight.  I started writing a sonnet, but I got stuck on it.  Hopefully, I can return to it tomorrow. 

Watching other people fall asleep so easily on Skype makes me envious of their heavy eyes.  So tonight, I think I am going to skip a long thought out post, skip reading Game of Thrones, and just try to pass out.  I have an interview at Staples tomorrow afternoon, then back to downtown Los Angeles for more Cinema 4D work.

Although I am super tired, I am really happy to be working on some VFX work.  It is interesting how what I have landed doing has been something I have had a desire to do for awhile, but I have not focused  a lot of energy on.  Now I need to regain energy so I can put more into these projects I am working on.  Here's to learning.  And sleep.  And dreams.  Good Night.  Good Morning.  Good Day.











I said Good Day.

Plagiarism







Plagiarism is defined in dictionaries as the "wrongful appropriation," "close imitation," or "purloining and publication" of another author's "language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions," and the
representation of them as one's own original work, but the notion remains problematic with nebulous boundaries. The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in Europe only in the 18th century, particularly with the Romantic movement,
 while in the previous centuries authors and artists were encouraged to 
"copy the masters as closely as possible" and avoid "unnecessary 
invention."

The 18th century new morals have been institutionalized and enforced prominently in the sectors of academia and journalism, where plagiarism is now considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics, subject to sanctions like expulsion and other severe career damage. Not so in the arts, which not only have resisted in their long-established tradition of copying as a fundamental practice of the creative process, but with the boom of the modernist and postmodern movements in the 20th century, this practice has been heightened as the central and representative artistic device. Plagiarism remains tolerated by 21st century artists.


Plagiarism is not a crime per se but is disapproved more on the grounds of moral offence, and cases of plagiarism can involve liability for copyright infringement.


Twentieth-century dictionaries define plagiarism as "wrongful 
appropriation," "close imitation," or "purloining and publication," of 
another author's "language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions," and the representation of them as one's own original work, but the notion remains problematic with nebulous boundaries. There is no rigorous and precise distinction between imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery.


In the 1st century, the use of the Latin word plagiarius (literally kidnapper), to denote someone stealing someone else's work, was pioneered by Roman poet Martial,
 who complained that another poet had "kidnapped his verses." This use 
of the word was introduced into English in 1601 by dramatist Ben Jonson, to describe as a plagiary someone guilty of literary theft.

The derived form plagiarism was introduced into English around 1620.[19] The Latin plagiārius, "kidnapper", and plagium, "kidnapping", has the root plaga ("snare", "net"), based on the Indo-European root *-plak, "to weave" (seen for instance in Greek plekein, Bulgarian "плета" pleta, Latin plectere, all meaning "to weave").


The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal, emerged in Europe only in the 18th century, particularly with the Romantic movement. Romantic aesthetic and ideology, still retains a significant strength 
in the 20th century, and encourages attaks against all that violates its
 values of genius, originality and individuality. From the Romantic perspective, artistic techniques like parody are considered parasitic. For centuries before, not only literature was considered "publica materies,"
 a common property from which anybody could borrow at will, but the 
encouragement for authors and artists was actually to "copy the masters 
as closely as possible," for which the closer the copy the finer was 
considered the work. This was the same in literature, music, painting and sculpture. In some
 cases, for a writer to invent their own plots was reproached as 
presumptuous. This stood at the time of Shakespeare
 too, when it was common to appreciate more the similarity with an 
admired classical work, and the ideal was to avoid "unnecessary 
inventiom."


The modern ideals for originality and against plagiarism appeared in the 18th century, in the context of the economic and political history of the book trade, which will be exemplary and influential for the subsequent broader introduction of capitalism. Originality, that traditionally had been deemed as impossible, was turned into an obligation by the emerging ideology of individualism. In 1755 the word made it into Johnson's influential A Dictionary of the English Language, where he was cited in the entry for copier ("One that imitates; a plagiary; an imitator. Without invention a painter is but a copier, and a poet but a plagiary of others."), and in its own entry denoting both A thief in literature ("one who steals the thoughts or writings of another") and The crime of literary theft.


Later in the 18th century, the Romantic movement completed the transformation of the previous ideas about literature, developing the Romantic myth of artistic inspiration,
 which believes in the "individualised, inimitable act of literary 
creation", in the ideology of the "creation from nothingness" of a text 
which is an "autonomous object produced by an individual genious." Plagiarism has often been used as a derogatory term for parodies.

Despite the 18th century new morals, and their current enforcement in
 the ethical codes of academia and journalism, the arts, by contrast, 
not only have resisted in their long-established tradition of copying as
 a fundamental practice of the creative process, but with the boom of the modernist and postmodern
 movements, this practice has been accelerated, spread, increased, 
dramatically amplifyied to an unprecedented degree, to the point that 
has been heightened as the central and representative artistic device of these movements. Plagiarism remains tolerated by 21st century artists. An early rebuttal to Romantic aesthetic in this respect, came from Russian formalism.


Though plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing, 
it does not exist in a legal sense. "Plagiarism" is not mentioned in any
 current statute, either criminal or civil. Some cases may be treated as unfair competition or a violation of the doctrine of moral rights. The increased availability of intellectual property due to a rise in technology has furthered the debate as to whether copyright offences are criminal. In short, people are asked to use the guideline, "...if you did not write it yourself, you must give credit."

Plagiarism is not the same as copyright infringement.
 While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different 
concepts. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a 
copyright holder, when material restricted by copyright is used without 
consent. On the other hand, the moral concept of plagiarism is concerned
 with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation
 that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Plagiarism is not 
illegal towards to author, but towards the reader, patron or teacher. 
Even when copyright has expired, false claims of authorship may still 
constitute plagiarism.


Within academia, plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered academic dishonesty or academic fraud, and offenders are subject to academic censure, up to and including expulsion. In journalism, plagiarism is considered a breach of journalistic ethics,
 and reporters caught plagiarizing typically face disciplinary measures 
ranging from suspension to termination of employment. Some individuals 
caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they
 plagiarized unintentionally, by failing to include quotations or give the appropriate citation. While plagiarism in scholarship and journalism has a centuries-old history, the development of the Internet, where articles appear as electronic text, has made the physical act of copying the work of others much easier.

For professors and researchers, plagiarism is punished by sanctions 
ranging from suspension to termination, along with the loss of 
credibility and perceived integrity. Charges of plagiarism against students and professors are typically 
heard by internal disciplinary committees, which students and professors
 have agreed to be bound by. 

Journalism
Since journalism's main currency is public trust, a reporter's 
failure to honestly acknowledge their sources undercuts a newspaper or 
television news show's integrity and undermines its credibility. 
Journalists accused of plagiarism are often suspended from their 
reporting tasks while the charges are being investigated by the news 
organization. 


The ease with which electronic text can be reproduced from online 
sources has lured a number of reporters into acts of plagiarism: 
Journalists have been caught "copying-and-pasting" articles and text 
from a number of websites.

Sanctions for student plagiarism
In the academic world, plagiarism by students is a very serious 
offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the 
particular assignment (typically at the high school level) or for the 
course (typically at the college or university level). For cases of repeated plagiarism, or for cases in which a student 
commits severe plagiarism (e.g., submitting a copied piece of writing as
 original work), a student may be suspended or expelled. In many universities, academic degrees or awards may be revoked as a penalty for plagiarism. A plagiarism tariff has been devised for UK higher education institutions in an attempt to encourage some standardization. 

Students may feel pressured to complete papers well and quickly, and 
with the accessibility of new technology (the Internet) students can 
plagiarize by copying and pasting information from other sources. This is often easily detected by teachers for several reasons. First, students' choices of sources are frequently unoriginal; 
instructors may receive the same passage copied from a popular source 
from several students. Second, it is often easy to tell whether a 
student used his or her own "voice". Third, students may choose sources which are inappropriate, inaccurate,
 or off-topic. Fourth, lecturers may insist that submitted work is first
 submitted to an online plagiarism detector. 

There has been increasing recognition that some plagiarism occurs 
because students are unaware of acceptable writing practices or may even
 have developed writing practices considered unacceptable in higher 
education as part of their prior education. This has led to a call for a greater emphasis on helping students learn about plagiarism as part of a holistic approach suggested by MacDonald and Carroll (2006). As a consequence, consideration has now been given to the best ways to 
help students learn about plagiarism with suggestions by Carroll (2006) 
that students should be allowed to experiment and the Joint Information 
Systems Committee (a body advising higher education in the UK) that 
students should be able to develop their understanding of plagiarism 
through making mistakes, which means that they may need to produce some 
unacceptable writing and receive feedback on it before understanding 
that it is unacceptable. When considering how best to help students learn about plagiarism, 
"recognition of individual learner differences" is important. A large amount of the research which has taken place into plagiarism 
and learner differences has taken place in the context of students 
studying overseas. However, while it might be useful to understand the range of reasons 
suggested in this research, Carroll (2008), writing in a UK context, 
suggests that the variety of understandings of plagiarism are likely as 
varied amongst domestic students.

There is little academic research into the frequency of plagiarism in
 high schools. Much of the research investigated plagiarism at the 
post-secondary level. Of the forms of cheating, (including plagiarism, inventing data, and 
cheating during an exam) students admit to plagiarism more than any 
other. A Duke University in 2005 found that 58% of high school students have 
plagiarized at least once as found in a study size of 18,000 
participants. However, this figure decreases considerably when students are asked 
about the frequency of "serious" plagiarism (such as copying most of an 
assignment or purchasing a complete paper from a website). Recent use of
 plagiarism detection software (see below) gives a more accurate picture
 of this activity's prevalence.

Self-plagiarism (also known as "recycling fraud")
 is the reuse of significant, identical, or nearly identical portions of
 one's own work without acknowledging that one is doing so or without 
citing the original work. Articles of this nature are often referred to 
as duplicate or multiple publication.
 In addition to the ethical issue, this can be illegal if copyright of 
the prior work has been transferred to another entity. Typically, 
self-plagiarism is only considered to be a serious ethical issue in 
settings where a publication is asserted to consist of new material, 
such as in academic publishing or educational assignments. It does not apply (except in the legal sense) to public-interest texts,
 such as social, professional, and cultural opinions usually published 
in newspapers and magazines.

In academic fields, self-plagiarism occurs when an author reuses 
portions of his own published and copyrighted work in subsequent 
publications, but without attributing the previous publication. Identifying self-plagiarism is often difficult because limited reuse of material is both legally accepted (as fair use) and ethically accepted.

It is common for university researchers to rephrase and republish 
their own work, tailoring it for different academic journals and 
newspaper articles, to disseminate their work to the widest possible 
interested public. However, it must be borne in mind that these 
researchers also obey limits: If half an article is the same as a 
previous one, it will usually be rejected. One of the functions of the 
process of peer review in academic writing is to prevent this type of "recycling".

The concept of self-plagiarism
 The concept of "self-plagiarism" has been challenged as self-contradictory or an oxymoron.

For example, Stephanie J. Bird argues that self-plagiarism is a misnomer, since by definition plagiarism concerns the use of others' material.

However, the phrase is used to refer to specific forms of potentially
 unethical publication. Bird identifies the ethical issues sometimes 
called "self-plagiarism" as those of "dual or redundant publication." 
She also notes that in an educational context, "self-plagiarism" may 
refer to the case of a student who resubmits "the same essay for credit 
in two different courses." As David B. Resnik clarifies, 
"Self-plagiarism involves dishonesty but not intellectual theft.

According to Patrick M. Scanlon


"Self-plagiarism" is a term with some specialized currency. Most 
prominently, it is used in discussions of research and publishing 
integrity in biomedicine, where heavy publish-or-perish demands have led
 to a rash of duplicate and "salami-slicing" publication, the reporting 
of a single study's results in "least publishable units"
 within multiple articles (Blancett, Flanagin, &amp; Young, 1995; 
Jefferson, 1998; Kassirer &amp; Angell, 1995; Lowe, 2003; McCarthy, 
1993; Schein &amp; Paladugu, 2001; Wheeler, 1989). Roig (2002) offers a 
useful classification system including four types of self-plagiarism: 
duplicate publication of an article in more than one journal; 
partitioning of one study into multiple publications, often called 
salami-slicing; text recycling; and copyright infringement.

Self-plagiarism and codes of ethics
Some academic journals have codes of ethics which specifically refer to self-plagiarism. For example, the Journal of International Business Studies.


Some professional organizations like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) have created policies that deal specifically with self-plagiarism.

Other organizations do not make specific reference to self-plagiarism:

The American Political Science Association (APSA) has published a 
code of ethics which describes plagiarism as "deliberate appropriation 
of the works of others represented as one's own." It does not make any 
reference to self-plagiarism. It does say that when a thesis or 
dissertation is published "in whole or in part", the author is "not 
ordinarily under an ethical obligation to acknowledge its origins.
The American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) has published a
 code of ethics which says its members are committed to: "Ensure that 
others receive credit for their work and contributions," but it does not
 make any reference to self-plagiarism.
 
Factors that justify reuse
 Pamela Samuelson
 in 1994 identified several factors which excuse reuse of one's 
previously published work without the culpability of self-plagiarism. She relates each of these factors specifically to the ethical issue of 
self-plagiarism, as distinct from the legal issue of fair use of 
copyright, which she deals with separately. Among other factors which 
may excuse reuse of previously published material Samuelson lists the 
following:

The previous work needs to be restated in order to lay the groundwork for a new contribution in the second work.

Portions of the previous work must be repeated in order to deal with new evidence or arguments.

The audience for each work is so different that publishing the same 
work in different places was necessary to get the message out.

The author thinks they said it so well the first time that it makes no sense to say it differently a second time.


Samuelson states she has relied on the "different audience" rationale
 when attempting to bridge interdisciplinary communities. She refers to 
writing for different legal and technical communities, saying: "there 
are often paragraphs or sequences of paragraphs that can be bodily 
lifted from one article to the other. And, in truth, I lift them." She 
refers to her own practice of converting "a technical article into a law
 review article with relatively few changes—adding footnotes and one 
substantive section" for a different audience.

Samuelson describes misrepresentation as the basis of 
self-plagiarism. She seems less concerned about reuse of descriptive 
materials than ideas and analytical contents. She also states "Although it seems not to have been raised in any of 
the self-plagiarism cases, copyrights law's fair use defense would 
likely provide a shield against many potential publisher claims of 
copyright infringement against authors who reused portions of their 
previous works."

Walden University, New England College of Business, and possibly 
other Universities are currently developing and promoting policies which
 support the use of students in citing their own previous work. The 
previously written work must be clearly indicated within a separate 
paragraph (entirely indented 1/2 of an inch per APA format), using an 
in-text citation and accompanying reference. The following is an APA 
example of how this may be accomplished to allow students to improve 
upon their previously written work and avoid self-plagiarism:

In-text citation appearing at the end of the paragraph before the period: (Smith, 2012).

Reference: Smith, R. (2012). Challenges in global compliance. 
Unpublished paper, Name Of Student's College, City (where college is 
located), State.
 
Organizational publications
 Plagiarism is presumably not an issue when organizations issue 
collective unsigned works since they do not assign credit for 
originality to particular people. For example, the American Historical Association's
 "Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct" (2005) regarding 
textbooks and reference books states that, since textbooks and 
encyclopedias are summaries of other scholars' work, they are not bound 
by the same exacting standards of attribution as original research and 
may be allowed a greater "extent of dependence" on other works. However, even such a book does not make use of words, phrases, or 
paragraphs from another text or follow too closely the other text's 
arrangement and organization, and the authors of such texts are also 
expected to "acknowledge the sources of recent or distinctive findings 
and interpretations, those not yet a part of the common understanding of
 the profession."

Within an organization, in its own working documents, standards are 
looser but not non-existent. If someone helped with a report, they may 
expect to be credited. If a paragraph comes from a law report, a 
citation is expected to be written down. Technical manuals routinely 
copy facts from other manuals without attribution, because they assume a
 common spirit of scientific endeavor (as evidenced, for example, in free and open source software projects) in which scientists freely share their work.


The Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications Third Edition (2003) by Microsoft does not even mention plagiarism, nor does Science and Technical Writing: A Manual of Style,
 Second Edition (2000) by Philip Rubens. The line between permissible 
literary and impermissible source code plagiarism, though, is apparently
 quite fine. As with any technical field, computer programming makes use
 of what others have contributed to the general knowledge.

Plagiarism and the history of art

Through all of the history of literature and of the arts in general, works of art are for a large part repetitions of the tradition; to the entire history of artistic creativity belong plagiarism, literary theft, appropriation, incorporation, retelling, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, reprise, thematic variation, ironic retake, parody, imitation, stylistic theft, pastiches, collages, and deliberate assemblages. There is no rigorous and precise distinction between practices like imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery.
 These appropriation procedures are the main axis of a literate culture,
 in which the tradition of the canonic past is being constantly 
rewritten.

These appropriation procedures, vital to the whole history of art, 
have gained more and more importance since the beginning of the 20th 
century, with the boom of the modernist and postmodern movements; in modernist and postmodernist art, appropriation has been heightened as the central and representative device.

Praisings of artistic plagiarism
A famous passage of Laurence Sterne's 1767 Tristram Shandy, condemns plagiarism by resorting to plagiarism. Oliver Goldsmith commented:


Sterne's Writings, in which it is clearly shewn, that he, whose 
manner and style were so long thought original, was, in fact, the most 
unhesitating plagiarist who ever cribbed from his predecessors in order 
to garnish his own pages. It must be owned, at the same time, that 
Sterne selects the materials/ of his mosaic work with so much art, 
places them so well, and polishes them so highly, that in most cases we 
are disposed to pardon the want of originality, in consideration of the 
exquisite talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into 
the new form.

On December 6, 2006, Thomas Pynchon joined a campaign by many other major authors to clear Ian McEwan of plagiarism charges by sending a typed letter to his British publisher, which was published in the Daily Telegraph.

Playwright Wilson Mizner said "If you copy from one author, it's plagiarism. If you copy from two, it's research."

American author Jonathan Lethem delivered a passionate defense of the use of plagiarism in art in his 2007 essay "The ecstasy of influence: A plagiarism" in Harper's Magazine.
 He wrote: "The kernel, the soul—let us go further and say the 
substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of all human 
utterances—is plagiarism" and "Don't pirate my editions; do plunder my 
visions. The name of the game is Give All. You, reader, are welcome to 
my stories. They were never mine in the first place, but I gave them to 
you."

Plagiarism on the Internet

Content scraping is copying and pasting from websites and blogs.

Free online tools are becoming available to help identify plagiarism, and there is a range of approaches that attempt to limit online copying, such as disabling right clicking
 and placing warning banners regarding copyrights on web pages. 
Instances of plagiarism that involve copyright violation may be 
addressed by the rightful content owners sending a DMCA removal notice to the offending site-owner, or to the ISP that is hosting the offending site.

Detecting plagiarism even by detection tools can still be difficult, 
as plagiarism is often held to not only be the mere copying of text, but
 also the presentation of another's ideas as one's own, regardless of 
the specific words or constructs used to express that idea. However, 
many so-called plagiarism detection services can only detect blatant 
word-for-word copies of text.
 
As a practical issue

In addition to legal and ethical concerns, plagiarism is frequently 
also a practical issue, in that it is frequently useful to consult the 
sources used by an author, and plagiarism makes this more difficult. 
There are a number of reasons why this is useful:

An author may commit an error in how they interpret or use a source,
 and consulting the original source allows these errors to be detected.

Authors generally only supply the portions of prior works that are 
directly relevant to the work at hand. Other portions of their sources 
are likely to be relevant to later extensions and generalizations of 
their work.

As modern automated indexing methods become prevalent, references 
between works provide valuable information about their authoritativeness
 and how closely works are related; this helps to locate relevant works.

Video Games Kill People







While reading up on the Aurora shooting, I came across an article stating that the shooter " 'was obsessed with computer games and was always playing role-playing games,' the unidentified friend said. 'I can't remember which one but it was something like World of Warcraft, one of those where you compete against people on the internet.' "

A criminal profiler stated on CNN that James was a young man needing to find attention with nothing to lose, sitting at home playing video games, "shooting, shooting, shooting, building up his courage and excitement for when it's going to be real for him...it is a problem in our society for teenage psychopaths, that they do get, you know, inspired by a lot of this and want to make it real, so it is a danger, but it doesn't make you a psycho"

So first off, my thoughts go to all the victims of the shooting.  This post is not meant to be of an offensive nature to the shooting in particular.  This post, however, is more inclined to question the authenticity of the argument that video games make people violent.

I, for one, have played and still play some pretty violent video games: CoD series, God of War series, GTA series.  Have I ever gotten angry while playing these games?? Yes.  Have I ever had a need to take it out on anyone? No.  I remember last year while playing Dark Souls on my PS3, I would die a lot in the game and get pissed.  My mother, if I recall correctly, made the following comment, "I have never heard you swear as much as you do playing that game."  She probably had a point to be made, that the game was upsetting.  But the game, although it upset me, was designed for the player to overcome challenges, some of which can be more difficult than most video games on the market.

As for role-playing games such as, World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, City of Heroes, RIFT, Diablo 3, there have been limited occurrences in which these games have actually been the main reason people have harmed other people.  Now I am not denouncing that there may be some sort of causual relation to the incident and the video game, but I, personally, do not believe video games make anyone commit heinous acts.  There are usually far deeper issues that lie within a person and something else happens, either while playing the game or from playing the game (notice the different prepositions), that chain reacts to someone causing harm to another.

I do take into account the amount of video game related crimes that have occurred.  Man kills infant when bothered during MapleStory.  Man finds another and stabs him for killing him in Counter-Strike.  Chinese man kills friend for selling virtual Legend of Mir 3 sword (worth about $861).  This is not an issue of video games causing violence but more of an issue of people taking video games too far.  There is a fine line between enjoying a game and the game controlling one's life.

I, when I get depressed or bored, reach to video games as a mode of stress relief and escape.  Yes, there are times where the games get extremely frustrating and things can be taken a bit too far.  But how fine is that line?  If someone uses the phrase, it's just a game, tell them that line is bullshit.  Video games, in a sense, are just like the real lives we live.  We spend hours working in-game so we can afford to buy better items that will let us live our virtual lives a little easier.  In addition, we compete to collect vanity items, either by reward or by purchase.  This is no different than working every day to support our family and hope to make more money next year.  We, in our real lives, compete against friends, family, and society to show off who has the nicer car, or house, or island fortress.  These are all arbitrary materialistic objects that, in the end, have no relevance after we have been fed to the worms.

The main point of this post is that we need to really look at the underlying cause behind the people that surround these video game accusations.  Today's society is so ready to point the finger at someone else, rather than say it is their fault, that video games have become the easy target to blame.  Why not blame the parents for raising their children right?  Why not blame the government for having a better economy or education system?  It is because those systems have the power to shove the blame elsewhere.  Where do video game corporations get to have protection from accusations?

I do not know the answer, but I definitely know that there are more issues with the people that cause the crimes than the simple "video game" theory.  Maybe we should start looking at ourselves as a community and figure out how we can help people like this, not condemn them.  No one can ever be rehabilitated as long as society is constantly reminding them of their crimes.  How can they move on and progress when we, as a society, will not allow them that privilege?

I know some people may think that because they have committed a heinous crime they do not deserve the chance to make right their wrongs.  But who are we to make that decision?  Hatred, revenge, condemnation, these things NEVER have positive results.  Maybe we should start analyzing what works.  Obviously our prison system does not work and is sometimes sought as a better home than the homes we struggle to live in each day.  Let us fix that.  Let us fix the amount of psychological and sociological impairments that affect, negatively, our citizens so that we can, hopefully, someday become the greatest country in the world 

Video games are not the criminals when it comes to laying the blame.  There have often been times where simple games like Yahtzee and Bejeweled have enraged me more than any other video game (mostly because I can never beat my mother at Bejewled).  Besides, another source stated that James Holmes spent many hours indoors playing Guitar Hero.  If that games leads one to go on a killing spree, then watch out, Blizzard has millions of disappointed gamers playing Diablo 3...

P.S. Somewhere I got off on tangents, but I hope I was able to bring this back home.

New Internship







As most of you know, when I first moved back to Los Angeles, or at least when I first came out here prior to deciding to stay, I joined up with an old acquaintance, Liz Brown, who was producing a project with Hollywood Bubble, Inc. for YouTube.  I came out here excited to be involved in something that was not surrounded by cows, corn stalks, and combines tractors; all three of which were not found on the set of "Times Up," the upcoming web series I worked on.

During my time on set I met some amazing, talented artists.  Ruben Garay, a talented director, had brought on board a lot of people to work on this project, all with their own strengths and inspirations for the project.  Among one of the many involved was a VFX artist named Collazo Versace.

I became acquainted with him and watch him and his crew set up the green screening as well as yell at the other crew for walking on his painted green screen.  Yelling, no matter how often it occurs, did not keep people from being oblivious of the space asked not to be walked on.

While on set for pick-up shooting, I gathered the courage to start talking to Collazo about his work, what he does, what he has done, what software he works with, how large is his render farm, etc.  I eventually got to the point where I asked him about interning or PAing with him.

Well, folks.  Today I received the call, or rather, the Facebook message.  So this tomorrow, Thursday the 26th, I begin a new adventure under the tutelage of Collazo Versace.  I'm sure most, if not all of you have seen his work.  He has served as a digital compositor for several films over the past few years, one of which is the newly released Dark Knight Rises.  More notably, he was part of the Oscar nominated visual effects team for Dreamworks's Real Steel.  So I am stoked to be involved with him and learn as much as I can.

But, on a practical note, what brought me to the point of wanting to work with a VFX artist?

Growing up, I taught myself 3D modeling in an old program called Bryce 5, now owned by Daz Studios.  I was, and still would say, I am not amazing.  I have a good aptitude for learning and have been able to fidangle my way around various programs.  In 2006, thanks to my friend Dirk, I got an unpaid internship at a small video production company in Spearfish, SD.  Western Sky Media, Inc. as it is named, was mostly focused on its regional real estate at the time, with some projects in the commercial market.  Bryan Lessly, the CEO of the company had a program on his system called Cinema 4D but he never used it because his old partner, before the guy was bought out, was the person who used the software.  So I took a crack at it.  Made me a little duck race, following a tutorial that came with the software.  Over the next 5 years, I moved from unpaid intern to a freelance 3D animator designing little animated poker chips; exploding bags that rained money; a thermometer that exploded, also raining money; some company logos, and a thirty-second new open to the Home Show.

So, as one may be able to tell, I have had a lot of interest and some experience working in the world of visual effects and 3D modeling.  I am, by no means, amazing at it and I have a lot of work to do.  Especially in the skills of drawing and modeling.  But my need to learn has always been a good motivator for me to excel at something new or to expand on the knowledge and skills I have already trained.  Never doubt the skills you take great interest in; someday your career path may and probably will change from what was initially intended.  Keeping options open is never a bad idea.

That said, do not confuse this as my back-up plan.  I have always had a desire to work in film whether it be in music composition, acting, directing, or animation.  As long as I am pursuing an artistic career in this industry, I have never failed at my goals.  I have bent and tuned them slightly, but they all reach an end goal of working in the film industry.

Be sure to look at your own life goals and evaluate where you wish to be most; the path getting there is not going to be easy, but it will be an adventure.

Much Ado About Blogging







First and foremost, I would love to know who from Russia is viewing this blog.  I find it intriguing to know the audience, especially when the audience is from another country, one from which I do not believe I know anyone.  So you should toss me an email to say hello. michael.allen.hollinger@gmail.com

Some days writing this blog feels like a chore, and I do not want it to feel as such.  Just some days there does not seem like I know what to write about.  I have been keeping up with writing for nearly two weeks straight, a new set of typeset characters each day.  What makes it feel like a chore is that I know I have an audience, even if it is ever so small, an audience with members I wish to please or, in the least, intrigue enough to examine their own lives with similar questions or even provoke new ones.

I know I have the few people that read this daily, as if they are receiving their "fix" or this represents the same relation as a newspaper with the morning coffee.  And for them, I do not want to disappoint by having very little to say.  Some days there just seems to be very little to say or, which is often the case, I wish to talk about some topic that can border the controversial borders of its arbitrary state but do not feel well-versed in the topic yet nor do I wish to offend my reader. 

A blog, first and foremost, should be for myself.  A safe zone where I may land my opinions, emotions, and imagination in an effective and organized manner.  On the other hand, as something such as this expands beyond the constraints of its original existence, the blog becomes a form of entertainment, infotainment, or a philosophical regime of words and phrases, all with the focus on the needs and wants of both myself, but, more importantly, the readers.

As I gain more time, by which I mean time stolen from one lazy activity to put into a different, less lazy, more productive activity, I will examine the overall presentation of this blog and figure out ways to get the reader more involved.  I know most people love to sit anonymously reading, which is fine, I wholeheartedly want the reader to be at their most comfortable when enjoying my reading, even if that means no pants, because, by God, I know I do not even wear pants when I write this thing.

What I hope to accomplish, once I start writing about some of more personal, controversial opinions, is to find a way to have a discussion, a civil debate, or thought generator between myself and the readers.  I want to find out what makes myself tick, what makes the readers tock, and in the time we spend discussing various topics, maybe we will all come out of this mad internet blogging world a little more enlightened with either a better outlook on life or a better understanding of the action of humankind upon humankind.

The silk is being spun, the web will be constructed, and soon I will have you all entangled and entrapped in the need to use critical thinking skills about the events and doctrines of our societies on this planet.  I will have to definitely start taking more time to do research before I write these, but, hopefully, I can start bringing to the table some more intriguing and intellectually stimulating material that does not only consist of me being emo and depressed.  There is too much positivity emanating from my great friends and family that I cannot waste more time being down in the dumps (although I will have my days where this will occur).  We are beginning to see an era where, more than ever, people need to have the skills to research and question everything as the future of our education, economy, and ecological system could be on the brink of deteriorating to nothing of value.

Drawing







I have always thought of myself as artistic.  I like to sit and doodle and create things.  I, however, have not taken an art class since high school (not counting theatre design).  Now, although I think during my high school years I made some really cool art, I have not created anything, by hand, not computer, that I am extremely proud of.  While chauffeuring my grams around yesterday, we stopped at a craft store so she could buy some fabric.  I decided to grab myself a new set of graphite drawing pencils and some sketchpads. 

As everything I do artistically, sometimes practicing is the hardest thing to force myself to do.  Drawing definitely falls into that category.  I get lazy when drawing because I know a lot of the things I sit and draw could be improved.  I remember sitting during Ms. Evans art classes when I was younger, learning about the "inner eye."  I understand the concept of the inner eye and I can, often, picture what I wish to draw in my mind.  I, however, have a hard time taking that image and transferring it onto paper.  I am sure this skill comes with a lot of practice, but usually, it feels too tedious to even put the effort to try to improve the skill. 

The hardest thing about wanting to practice is that I am working on a drawing project that I want to look really good, but the amount of time to practice combined with the project itself seems like more time I would like to put into the project.  But it is a sacrifice, if the project is to be successful, that must be made.

Like everything we want to excel at, we must practice, even if we are good at something.  As one of my acting teachers would say, "there is always room to do better."  You can make the strongest choices as an actor, play the most precise as a musician, or speak the clearest as a politician, but there is always room to improve.  No one is a master of every skill set, so there are things we can all get better at.  The problem, however, is that our society is so focused on teaching everything but the arts, although the large majority of successful role models are singers, actors, musicians, writers, directors, etc.: people working in an artistic industry.  Those role models are then followed by sports.  Our education system, however, leads us to believe that sports are better than arts because of the amount of money they bring into the institution.  But enough with that digression.

If I am to get better at drawing so this project can be completed and look awesome, I am definitely going to have to do some practice in drawing techniques as well as art styles.  We will see how the project turns out in a few weeks when I get some strong headway on it.  Until then, have a great Monday!

Too Competitive







I. Hate. Losing.

Simple fact right there.  There is a healthy nature of being competitive but there is definitely a line where one can be too competitive.  I cross that line, by a pretty far distance.

I was going to write about something in relation to yesterday's post but I think this post is more important.  More of a digression from what I was wanting to talk about, Acting Techniques.  So, today, I'm going to confront my competitive nature.

Growing up, I played a lot of sports: basketball, baseball, soccer, football, wrestling.  Winning was a big deal, although my parents would disagree and say having fun was more important.  While I believe having fun should be the most important aspect of any activity, I always strive to be good, if not the best, at something.  And this attitude requires of me to win, even at the stupidest of activities.

What prompted me to write about this topic?  Well, and believe me when I say this is really childish and stupid, I was losing at cards with my grams tonight.  And I was not just losing by a few points, I honestly was getting my ass handed to me every single deal.  She was unstoppable and there was nothing I could do.  And this pissed me off.  I did not say anything to her about me losing because that would have been rude and definitely uncalled for.  I did, however, have a little voice in my head screaming about how each and every hand was bullshit.  That is what my mind does.  If I am losing, it yells at me.  I stop having fun, focus on how I am losing, and get extremely frustrated when acknowledging that I have not the slightest chance in hell to win.  I do, however, chuckle at how much of a five-year-old I can be during instances like this.  Losing at cards today is not the first instance in which I know I am being overly competitive.

During graduate school, we would play volleyball at the park every Saturday we could when the weather was nice.  Now I am great at sand volleyball, by far, so I honestly should not have any room to get mad at people for not giving the effort I believe they should in order to make an attempt to actually win.  The purpose of the games on Saturdays was for all of us to get together, have some fun, and relax while not studying.  I did not, however, treat it as such.  I went to the games with the intention to win.  I would yell at opponents and teammates alike.  I would work my ass off to make sure plays were being made and I would yell at my classmates when they would stand idly by as the ball passed them, letting the other team score.  Now, I admit, I was in the wrong but I felt that people just did not care about the game itself.  And for me, to play a game means to do everything you can, within the rules, to win.

Maybe this comes from my incessant need to complete tasks and my observation that history and success is written by the winners of life.  There are very few losers that have documented their history.  Another reason this competitive nature of mine is highlighted is due to the fact that those that were good at winning, when I grew up, were the popular bunch.  If I can show that I am the best, that I am a winner, then I will become successful and get the girls.  Because that's what life is about.  Being successful and getting the beautiful girls.

The other side of this problem is that I cannot force myself not to be competitive.  I do not know how to shut it off.  I remember my ex, Shannon, while I was yelling at Call of Duty or some other game, asked me why I continue to play the game if I am losing.  I think my response was something along the lines of "I don't know, but I need to beat it," or some other answer that admitted I was playing to win, even if I hated it.

Speak of video games, they are the worst for someone competitive, mostly because with today's gaming PCs and consoles, there are tangible objects that are expensive that often become the object of focused rage.  With basketball, I may throw the ball at the fence or hoop or just slam it on the ground.  But I am most likely not going to break the object of my gaming.  With computers and consoles, however, we have these objects such as controllers, keyboards, headphones, mics, and monitors.  All of these, at some point, will become a victim to video game rage.  Being competitive is not a safe character feature to have when these devices do not come cheap.

So, yes, competition is definitely something I am really bad with.  And I will find ways to be competitive, whether it be with video games, sports, cards, art, or even arguments.  I just hate losing and have yet to find a way to get over feeling like a loser when I am not winning.  Even thinking about losing gets me kind of flustered.  I know I am not the only one out there with this problem.  But I figured I should let people know about it before I enter a ring and start yelling at them to stop sucking.  It is not meant to be a personal attack, although it will most definitely appear as such.

My Acting Philosphy








"Acting is not a genteel profession. Actors used to be buried at a crossroad with a stake through the heart. Those people's performances so troubled the onlookers that they feared their ghosts.  An awesome compliment. Those players moved the audience not such that they were admitted to a graduate school, or received a complimentary review, but such that the audience feared for their souls. Now that seems to me something to aim for."  - David Mamet, True and False, 6-7
Now do not get all tense because I may be talking about something you may not comprehend; acting, for the most part, can be very simple.  Over the course of several years with several teachers as well as some of the books I have read, I think I have really found where I sit with the art of acting.

There are two major rules to acting for me.  The first and foremost, speak the truth of the lines.  The first time I heard this direction was from a gentleman named Rob Clare.  He came to work with us during my graduate studies at Mary Baldwin College.  He would say, "stop thinking about the lines and just speak them truthfully."  This direction took me a long time to grasp, and, honestly, is one of the hardest things to do.  What is the truth of the line?

When we speak to one another, we often, I hope, speak the truth when we hold dialogue.  When I talk to my friend Alejandra, I, most the time, do not worry about all the tactics, and devices I am using.  I just talk: combine characters to form words that, put in a specific syntactical order, develop meaning.  I speak of Alejandra a lot in these posts because I get the great privilege to talk with her for long periods of time during the day.  Talking with her gives me a lot of practice at dialogue, except when I am told to wait or she falls asleep in the conversation.  But with those two exceptions aside, I get the chance to speak truthfully what I want and need to say.  What I am doing, how I am doing, and why I am doing any actions while in the conversation derive from the words I am saying.  To speak the lines truthfully gives me, as an actor, something to do, something to play, something to act.  For example, from Henry V:

O for a muse of fire that would ascend
The brightest heaven of invention.
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene.
Then, should the warlike Harry, like himself,
Assume the port of Mars, and at his heels,
Leashed in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire
Crouch for employment.
There is little analysis that needs to be done for that actor here.  Chorus is inviting the audience into the world of the play.  Shakespeare writes eloquently in a backward fashion.  Instead of saying 'the stage is the kingdom, actors will play princes,' he switches the structure slightly.  Shakespeare is telling the audience what they will see on stage.  Nothing more needs to really be analyzed.  This entire speech, if I were to quote it more, serves as an invitation to the audience telling them how to perceive the actions and actors on the stage so that they may enjoy the production the most.  So when I, or David Mamet, or Rob Clare say to say the lines truthfully, an actor does not need to delve into the subtext and the meaning of every word as some methods of acting require, but he or she only needs to speak the lines as they are and play the scene as best as she and he can.  Subtext cannot be played and cannot be caught by the audience.  Subtext is an analytical tool meant for scholars and readers, not performers.  And as some scholars have said, subtext is not an intention of the playwright.  The reader create subtext, not the actor, and most definitely not the audience.

My favorite line in the Shakespeare canon is "Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts."  Even if the actors are wrong, as long as they play truthfully, in the moment, the audience will accept the actors for whatever they are and can be on stage in that moment.  Only critics go to the theatre to despise the performers, audiences go there to be entertained.  If actors play their characters, lines, and actions truthfully, then the audience will be entertained.  But if the actor tries to force some other context other than the basic letters and words that the text consists of, the audience will shy away from the performance, believe it to be fake.

This leads me to my second important rule for the actor, the focus is not on yourself but on the audience and your colleagues.  While studying Shakespeare in graduate school, I really began to appreciate the audience and their role in the theatre.  An audience is a participating character.  They may not have lines, but they are the strongest character in the play; they are the ones that take something home after the curtains are closed (or so we hope).  Acting is a conversation between the actors on stage as well as the actors with the audience.  Think of the most difficult times of our lives as human beings, even when we feel alone in our rooms.  We talk, we write, we sing.  But we are not alone.  We anticipate that something in this world is listening, whether it be a God figure, a plant, an animal, or a stapler.  By acting upon the truth of the moments we live, we hope to receive something back from this life we live in order to help us make decisions more effectively and for the best.  So when I think of acting, too often I see actors that escape into some inner world, shutting out the rest of us, to hide for a moment and try to force the creation of an emotion.

I recently was working on a YouTube project and I was witness to the perfect example.  A scene was being shot where the girl is in a sorrow state, realizing that she did not wish to be with the guy she was with anymore.  The actress put herself in a place to try to force tears to swell.  After several takes, the actress asked the director, "can we move to the happy scene," to which he replied, "no, we have to get this shot."  Several points can be made out of this single instance.  First, the actress was distressed by the emotions she was trying to create.  This inner world was affecting her performance, but not in a positive manner.  Wherever she took herself, I could see that it was having a negative toll on her energy and performance.  No actor should ever put him or herself in a place that truly puts them in a state where they have lost control of emotion.  Acting is not about losing control, it is about almost losing control but having perfect control in a chaotic state.

During my movement classes in graduate school, J.P. Scheidler would often ask us to see how long we can state in one state as we transfer into another state and can we be in both at one time.  He would push us to our limits to make us find where we lose control.  When we lose control, we go back, reevaluate, and try again, trying to blur the line between control and loss of control.  Once that is mastered, an actor will have more control of his or her body allowing for more choices to be made.  

So to go back to the example of the actress, she found her loss of control, but she was not able to reel it back in and keep control of it.  Her emotions began to control her instead of the other way around.  The second, and more important point to be made, is that the actress lost all form of communication with the other actor on set as well as the audience (camera or actual audience, depending on whether you follow Walter Benjamin's philosophical theories).  If no communication is being made to the other actor or the audience, then the performer is disrespectful of their needs and wants from the scene. 

I remember during graduate school, I asked a J.P. how do I deal with other actors when they are not willing to communicate with me.  His, and I believe Colleen's response, was that is a question every actor asks when dealing with new partners and that we have to find ways to keep the communication.  What I have observed and learned through practice and performance is that if there is no communication, whether it is with the audience or with the partners on stage, then the play is flat and dead.  To return to my conversations with Alejandra, if I do not listen to her then I cannot properly respond to her.  The same can be said that if she does not convey the information properly then I cannot respond correctly, either.  A relationship on stage is the same as a relationship in life.  Both parties have to be willing to communicate their wants and needs proficiently or else nothing will be gained.

The further expand on audience as a conversing member of the playhouse, then the actor must focus energy, even when alone on stage, towards the audience.  When I read David Mamet's True or False for the first time, I found the following paragraphs, and knew that others saw the audience the way I do.

     "If, for example, they can just learn to 'believe.'
     But we cannot control what we believe.
     Religions and political creeds which degenerate in that direction demand belief.  They receive from their adherents not belief (which cannot be controlled) but a certain more-or-less well-meaning avowel of hypocrisy: 'I proclaim that I have mastered that over which I know I have no control, that I am part of the brotherhood which proclaims similarly, and that I am opposed to all who do not so proclaim.'
     The strength of these groups is directly proportional to the individual's knowledge of his own failure to fulfill its goals---it is the individual's attempt to conceal his shame which binds these groups together.  This is the grand adhesive of the acting school.  It is the reason for 'the fourth wall.' The so-called Fourth Wall is a construction of someone afraid of the audience.  Why should we strive to convince ourselves of the patently false?
     There is not a wall between the actor and the audience.  Such would defeat the very purpose of thatre, which is communication and communion.
     Respect for the audience is the foundation of all legitimate actor training---speak up, speak clearly, open yourself out, relax your body, find a simple objective; practice in these goals is practice in respect for the audience, and, without respect for the audience, there is no respect for the theatre; there is only self-absorption." (58-59)
 What I have come to learn in today's world of theater and film, is that people want to focus on themselves, disregarding the audience, the paying patrons that allow actors to express themselves in ways that many of us are too often to do in our day-to-day lives.

So to my theatre and film friends, do yourselves, your actors, and your audiences a favor by allowing your performers to play truthfully.  Acting, in its most simplistic form, is playing.  Most of us act each and every day whether we are aware of it or not.  People pretend to like each other, people pretend to be happy.  These objectives and tactics are simple to humans.  The hardest part, however, about acting is our brain.  As my undergraduate teacher pointed out, actors are people that lose all common sense when they walk on the stage.  Ask an actor to enter a room on stage and they will forget that a door must be shut after entering.  These are simple awarenesses that we forget because our brain gets in the way.  So stop thinking and just do.  Play truthfully, for the respect of yourself, your fellow actors and performers, and, more importantly, for the audience paying to see you entertain.

And once the truth is mastered, then you may add all the methods you like.

Aspirations







A friend of mine from graduate school commented on a status the other night 
about how I should write about what I love.  So tonight, I am writing why I chose the goals for my education and career.  This will be the first of posts discussing my career and what I theories I have about my work.

In the past several years, as a tutor, educator, and entertainer, I have had the honor to meet some of the most interesting people in my life.  Many of these people, however, make me question what it means to be alive and live happily.  I look around and see a generation and society more interested in deceit, money, and power than a society focused on the pursuit of self-expression, truth, and art.  Often when I talk to younger people (which makes me sound old), I tell them to pursue where their passions reside most.  But our economy and society makes it more difficult than ever to pursue these endeavors.

I will always pursue my passions, whether it be in career, education, or in love.  I gain an obsession for what I desire most and sometimes I wonder why I pursue the things that thing most intangible.  I have been asked several times by acquaintances, friends, and family what my "back-up plan" is.  Honestly, I have no back-up plan.  The following is an excerpt from David Mamet's True and False (a book which I will definitely be using in some other posts). 

     The best advice one can give an aspiring artist is 'Have something to fall back on.' The merit of the instruction is this: those who adopt it spare themselves the rigor of the artistic life.
     I was once at a marriage ceremony where the parties swore 'to try to be faithful, to try to be considerate . . .' That marriage was, of course, doomed.  Any worthwhile goal is difficult to accomplish.  to say of it 'I'll try' is to excuse oneself in advance.  Those who respond to our requests with 'I'll try' intend to deny us, and call on us to join in the hypocrisy---as if there were some merit in intending anything other than accomplishment.
     Those with 'something to fall back on' invariably fall back on it.  They intended to all along. That is why they provided themselves with it.  But those with no alternative see the world differently.  The old story has the mother say to the sea captain, 'Take special care of my son, he cannot swim,' to which the captain responds, 'Well, then, he'd better stay in the boat.'
           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most charming of theories holds that someone other than Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare's plays---that he was of too low a state, and of insufficient education.  But where in the wide history of the world do we find art created by the excessively wealthy, powerful, or educated?
     It is not folly to ascribe the oeuvre to the unlettered, but it certainly is so to ascribe it to the nobility, whose entire lives were, to torture the conceit, 'something to fall back on.'  It is both comfortable and prudent to have a fall-back position; and those possessing the happy same cannot help but have their work colored by it---such work must be more rational, considered, and possessed of the communitarian virtues than that of an outsider.  Such prudent work would tend to shun conflict . . . well, you get my drift.
     The other side of the coin is pride.  One could say, 'I am a fool, for I have not provided myself with an alternative'; one could also say, 'I see nothing else worthy my time,' which is, I think, a rather strengthening attitude.
     The cops say, 'I'm on the corner.'  Young folks in the theatre might have it, 'Molly can go home and John can go home, I am never going home.' Bravo. And good luck.
     Those of you with nothing to fall back on, you will find, are home.
This example from Mamet is important to my struggle for success.  I have always had my eye on being successful as an entertainer, whether it be acting, directing, or designing.  Anytime I step off the path to "make means meet," I fall into a depressive state because I am wasting time rather than doing what I love.  Even now, as I write this, I am spending very little time doing what I love.  Writing and reading is keeping myself informed of my talents and skills so that once I reach a position to pursue my goals again, I will be able to take a longer stride.

Pursuing a goal, a dream, an aspiration is like training for a marathon.  The first steps are going to be the hardest.  You can only run for short periods of time before the body gives up and needs to take a small break to recuperate.  Each day of training gets easier and easier as long as you stick to it.  But you will never be able to finish the marathon if you do not push through the training process.  Success only comes to those that work hard and stay on track.

So for me, to "have something to fall back on" is detrimental to my success.  I do not wish to do anything else.  I understand that I need to be able to afford to live comfortably, pay my debts, and save up so that I can pay for my kick ass Zombiepocalypse Wedding.  And I can take odd jobs while still focusing on working in the industry I love.  If I have learned anything over the past year with Cancer keeping me from pursuing my dreams is that even through the hardest struggles that life can throw at me, I have friends and family that will always support my in my journey.  I have also learned that even when I do struggle, I am happiest when I am surrounded by artists like myself, working on various projects, each with a common goal of self-expression.

Acting may not be the most lucrative industry to start a family with, but entertaining is where I find solace, serenity, succor.  Anything that keeps me from this pursuit takes me away from comfort and leads me to anxiety, agony, anguish.

Self-expression is an act that everyone, I believe, truly wishes to be apart of.  Actors use it as a means to tell stories.  Audiences see actors perform as a means to empathically respond as a means of self-expression.  I cry with the actress crying because I, too, feel the same emotion.  Art has the means to inspire people to love, hate, create, and destroy.  But without a means, be it art, music, theatre, filming, we would go through our existence as lifeless beings void of sentient.

If I can, just once, affect someone's life positively through the means of performance and art, then I am more successful and wealthy than any dry, beat-up, businessman or woman on Wall-street.  He or she may accrue more money than I in a single lifetime, but knowing that I have inspired another person to reevaluate the way the world works for them is beyond anything I could ask for.

My advice to everyone is to find your passion.  Pursue it.  Train for that marathon and make it happen.  As our world becomes crazier and more difficult to survive in, having that one thing that makes you burn for life will draw more happiness than anything else, tangible or not.

**Thank you Clara for telling me to write on topics I love.

I Hate Applying For Jobs







I apologize first that most of my posts seem like emo rants.  I try my best to not be emo but damn there are a lot of things that annoy me or piss me off.  Applying for jobs just happens to be one of them.

I graduated with my Master of Letters over a year ago.  Since then, and even prior to getting the degree, I have been applying for several jobs trying to find something thought offers benefits as well as a decent wage. Applying for jobs within the entertainment industry is hard enough, but to conquer the task of applying for jobs in different areas of interest, or "real jobs," is usually even worse.

Over the course of about a year I have applied to a large handful of companies varying from teaching to advertising, food service to tech positions.  For the most part, all of them sucked to apply for.  There are several different types of applications that anyone will ever encounter.

The first type is the basic job application.  This consists of a two sided sheet of paper that only allows enough space for name, address, position, wage desired, education, three (most recent) previous jobs, special skills, one to two references, and a signature.  Simple.  But there is usually never enough space to fill out the important information in the skills section.  These applications are often tossed in a folder and are rarely ever picked up again.  Sometimes the folder looks identical to a rubbish bin (research still underway).

The second type is the online or computer application.  These are the applications that most corporation entry-level positions require.  Applying in this manner is a little less tedious than the previous type because it can be saved online for future use and your hand probably will not cramp after several of these applications in one day.  In addition to the information provided in the paper application, these applications sometimes allow the user to upload a resume.  If you opt out of uploading a resume at that specific moment, however, you may not be able to upload it later when you edit the resume.  This discovery is quite annoying when you take the time to go make a resume for the application in order to upload it for the employer.  The largest addition, however, are the EOE questions that these companies require you to fill out.  If you've never seen one of these, most the questions follow as shown.


I would rather work alone than with a group of people 

Strongly disagree 

Disagree 

Neutral 

Agree 

Strongly Agree



My problem with these questions, is that 90% of them are extremely vague.  Look at the example I even gave.  I wish there was a write in box so I could write, "Depending on the project, I may prefer to work by myself, but if I am building a boat, I think I would prefer a hand or two."  I understand that the purpose of these questions is to possibly weed out the bad seeds infesting the application process, but what happened to the good old fashion interview (which I will get to shortly).  So, forty-five minutes later, you have completed one single application for Best Buy.  Do not worry, they hold it for sixty days before they toss it in their technological trash bin.  In which case, you have to remake the entire application.

The final type of application is the good ol' fashion Cover Letter and Resume/CV.  This is the most personal and professional form of applying to a job.  You tell the employer why you actually are applying and what you can bring to the table, all while providing them a simple short document with some work and education experience and special skills that show you to be the best candidate for the position.  If I were hiring, I would want to have people submit these.  The problem, however, when writing one, is that each one has to be tailored to every single job for which you apply.  If you are applying for the same job at various companies, luckily, only the cover letter must be rewritten for each company.  If, however, you are applying for anything and everything that you think you have the qualified work experience for, then enjoy writing a new cover letter as well as a new resume for each type of job for each company.  Enjoy.  This only takes more time than the previous two examples.

So what's next?  You've applied for a job and now you sit and wait for your application number to be drawn, an email or phone call to be received, and an interview to be scheduled.  Well that is taking the steps a little quicker than they actually happen. 

What I have experienced in the several jobs I have applied for, even the ones I had an "in" with, you will most likely never get contacted.  Over the past year, I have submitted for several teaching positions, some restaurant jobs, an paid advertising internship, Game Stop, Apple, Target, Staples, Six Flags Magic Mountain, various jobs on Craigslist including an casting assistant position for adult films.  None of these have contacted me for interviews.  I had to call or walk back in the companies and demand to know what is up with my application.  Well, not demand, more like gently walk in, email, or call and ask politely to speak with management or HR employee.  Most of the responses are definitely computer generated responses, "I'm sorry to let you know that your application has not been accepted," even when it comes from the beast's mouth.  Most of the employers do not want to take the time to even do that.  I was surprised when Trion Worlds contacted me to let me know that I was not fit for the position that I applied but they would keep my application on file in case something came up.  Surprised not because they rejected me, but surprised they even took the time to contact when the application explicitly said I would receive no further contact other than the recognition that the application was received.  So getting contacted is even a big step in the right direction for finding a job.

Once you've been contacted for an interview, whether by free choice or you've taken by force, the interview is often the next step to master.  This is where you have entered into the belly of the beast.  I actually think that the entire process of being interviewed can easily be compared to willfully stepping onto a serving platter for the beast to slowly tear you apart and devour you when you fail to answer correctly.  The questions often asked are just as vague as the questions in the EOE section of the online application.

"What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? Why do you want to be employed at Company A?  What can skills can you bring to the table?"
I usually just want to jump over the table and choke the little twat asking the questions.  I want to be employed because our economy is shit, the theatres are not hiring for staff, I need benefits, and I have a lot of student loans to pay off.  If those are driving forces for me to want to be hired and stay stably employed, then I have not the slightest idea what I am doing anymore. 

If you are lucky, you pass and get hired.  If you are kind of lucky, you pass, and are sent to another interview process, like what happened to me with Six Flags.  Six Flags is probably one the worst application/interview processes I have ever experienced.  I applied for the position.  Had my interview a few days later.  Passed the interview only to find out a second interview would be required for the position I was applying for.  I was perfectly fine with this, hopeful that my experience would get my the job.  A couple weeks go by, nothing.  I call HR and they tell me that there is nothing they can do.  I must wait for the Entertainment Department to contact me.  OK.  They are probably busy with beginning of summer season.  No problem.  I wait a couple more weeks, still no contact.  I call again and speak with a young woman about sending my information over the the department because I have an undergraduate degree in theatre and a graduate degree in Shakespeare.  She seems excited to inform me that she can indeed send my information over to the department and they would be interested since the tech job I applied for weeks prior would be opening up soon.  Awesome, I may get a job with benefits.  Two. More. Weeks. Pass. By.  WTF!?  Still no contact and I call one last time, HR tells me there is nothing that they can.  How is it that they have no ability to give me an email address or phone number of the person in the Entertainment Department so I can check on a job that requires more of me than some of those kids applying to just sell cotton candy, whom probably barely passed the ten question math test during the application process?  Yes, there was a math test.  Needless to say, I have not contacted Six Flags since my last attempt with the Human Resource Department.  They do not have the resources that I need, apparently.

So all in all, what this boils down to, is that in our economy where good jobs are scarce, those of us with an education have to resort to taking entry-level jobs that require no degree, no formal education or training, and use no brain power in order to bring home a measly minimum wage per hour salary.  With no benefits.  All this little reward for hours upon hours of effort applying for a numerous amount of jobs that I never really wanted in the first place but have to try to get because I cannot apply to the non-existent theatre jobs or the teaching positions that I do not have a certificate for which to qualify.  At least on a good note, God apparently does not want me to work at McDonald's because each time I go to talk to Alex, my old boss from eight years ago, he is either not there or he has called in sick and will not be back in a few days.  Enough time for me to hope on one of the other applications to follow through.

As a small side note before I close for the evening, I think online applications should only include a section to upload a resume/work history while keeping the EOE section as well.  If there was only one format, which most seem to follow anyway, a lot of time could be saved on both ends between filling out the forms as well as the number of pages that the web site must contain for all of the javascript and databases used currently.  If I could just go, upload the work history, education, etc., and then spend ten minutes filling out the EOE, I would be less stressed out from filling out several applications a day.

And with that.  Good morning, Thursday.
